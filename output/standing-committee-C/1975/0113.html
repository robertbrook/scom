INCREASE IN ADVANCES TO AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION LTD.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed—(16th December 1975)—No. 7,</i> in page 2, line 26, at the beginning, to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) It shall be a condition precedent to any action by the Minister under this section that the Minister take such steps as may be necessary and which he is hereby authorised so to do, to enable the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited to implement co-owner-ship plans and a mutual funded farming bank, the latter to provide credit for approved agricultural purposes to farmers in the United Kingdom on terms comparable to those available from similar institutions in other member countries of the European Economic Community"—[<i>Mr. Stanton</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a. m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are taking new Clause 2—Extension of Constitution of Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited:
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) The Minister may approve the aquisit ion of the issued share capital in the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited by a limited liability company having the same directors and shareholders as the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited and with power to create other subsidiary companies for the purposes of agricultural finance in the United Kingdom but so that the capital for such subsidiary companies shall be provided from commercial sources".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I concluded my remarks at our last sitting by wishing the Committee and yourself, Mr. Costain, a very happy Christmas, and I should like to start by wishing the Committee and yourself a happy New Year. But I want to continue where I left off, which was on the amendment and new Clause 2, in particular.<br><br>
Since we went into recess, I have had the opportunity of reading more care-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
fully the evidence which was given by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to the Select Committee on a Wealth Tax, and very revealing and interesting that evidence is. It shows more than anything else the need for these new arrangements to raise capital for the industry as a whole.<br><br>
I start by quoting two items from the evidence to the Select Committee. Of course, that evidence has now been published. First, in paragraph 8 on page 293 of the record of that Select Committee, the evidence says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If assets have to be realised to pay the tax,"</p></blockquote>
—that is wealth tax, but capital transfer tax is dealt with in the same breath—
<br><blockquote><p>"then inevitably a farmer would have to plan to sell small areas of land, which would in the short term reduce the productive capacity of the individual enterprise. The alternative open to the farmer of selling part of his live and dead stock could only have the result of damaging the viability of the enterprise."</p></blockquote>
Further down, in paragraph 10, it says that in the opinion of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
<br><blockquote><p>"the combined effects of Capital Transfer Tax and Wealth Tax will, in the long term, lead to the break-up of the existing family structure of farm ownership".</p></blockquote>
The whole object of the amendment and the new clause is to channel finance through a different method into the industry. It is, first, to deal with the effects of inflation. It is becoming more and more difficult, unless there is a more realistic pricing policy in farming, for sufficent profits to be generated by the enterprise to replace plant and equipment at new cost levels. Secondly, it is to deal with the whole problem of expansion, which we know is very dear to the Minister's heart. We have all read the White Paper " Food from Our Own Resources". That will require the generation of considerable amounts of capital which either will have to be provided by the industry itself, through a body such as the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation or, of course, through Government grants.<br><br>
Thirdly—and by far the most important—is the whole problem of taxation to which these two pieces of evidence refer. It has not been sufficiently realised either by the industry itself—although it is now rapidly coming round to understanding what it all means—or by the Treasury—which is far more important
A2
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
—what will happen when the full effects of capital transfer tax, on its own, begin to hit the industry. If there is to be a wealth tax—we know that it has been postponed for a year, but no one is under any illusions that it is the policy of the Government to bring it in at a later date—certainly agriculture cannot escape it. Its effects may be mitigated in one way or another, but certainly its effects on agriculture will be considerable. When those two taxes are added together, a farmer, or more particularly his successors in title, will be forced to sell parts of their farm in order to pay the tax. That is the point.<br><br>
The method proposed in the amendment will allow a farmer to sell part of the interest in his farm but without selling the full title to it. Also—this is the most attractive part—it will give him an option to recover his title at a later date. The Government may say that that finance can be provided by the banks. We know that, under existing profit levels in farming, that is quite impossible because the banks will not lend on sufficiently long terms. Therefore, there should be a system whereby the tax can be paid without selling land and whereby the money can be paid back over a sufficiently long time.<br><br>
I base my support for the amendments on those points. I am glad to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) is here. He took part in the Select Committee and heard the evidence to which I have referred.<br><br>
I hope that when the Minister replies he will look favourably on the whole principle and indicate to us whether our amendment is wrong or whether he would prefer to take the new clause instead of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to what my colleague the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Ben-yon) said. I hope with all sincerity that the Minister will study the AMC evidence. Here is a body which is away from the CLA, the NFU and interests on one side or another. On the Wealth Tax Committee it gave us probably the best, crispest, shortest and most to-thepoint evidence on finance and the land. I believe, with my personal experience of this matter, that this evidence is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
something which any Government must take seriously into account.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend has just said, the AMC states—it is obvious—that a wealth tax or other taxation may come to the point whereby farms have to be split up to pay the tax. The weight of legislation from both Governments over the past few years has been to try to amalgamate smallholdings into viable holdings. I am not asking for 10,000-acre holdings. I have a 14,000-acre holding in my constituency. I do not believe that holdings should be as big as that. One would have to be a superhuman man to run a holding of that size and make it as efficient as a 1,500-acre farm. But if a holding is split up it has to be sold to somebody. Who will buy the land? One does not want to sell more than one needs to pay that tax. One will look round for the odd corner, the odd field or two.<br><br>
Before the Community Land Bill was enacted one could usually finance expansion in agriculture by selling a field or two in the village for development purposes. That money was extremely well spent by the farming community, because 993/4 per cent. went back into the farm and enabled it to carry on.<br><br>
Now farmers have to look round for somebody to buy these odd fields. After a time it will not be just the odd field, but several hundred acres which will have to be sold, particularly when the succession duties bite. The only people who can buy without fear of taxation are the Crown, the Church Commissioners, the insurance companies—the Norwich Union has been a good landlord, but it has bought up, in my opinion, quite sufficient land in our part of the world—and now the pension funds. The pension funds, remotely administered, are sometimes not such good landlords as a landlord living in the village might be. I believe that we must find extra finance from somewhere. Where better than from the AMC?<br><br>
Many people have been grateful that pension funds have come back into the market for land in the past six months. buying at 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. If an ordinary farmer wants to borrow money. where does he go to but to the AMC? What rate does he borrow at? Is it 14 per cent.?I believe it is—13 3¾4 per cent. or l41¼4 per cent. That is more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
than double what his rivals who want to purchase can buy at.<br><br>
I therefore believe that expanding the activities of the AMC in the way that the AMC has suggested, enabling it to purchase part of a farmer's land when the time for heavy taxation comes and then, throughout the next generation, enabling the farmer to buy it back again, is one of the best ideas I have heard of. I hope that the Minister will consider that proposal very carefully. It is a sincere and sensible suggestion put forward by the AMC which has seen the great difficulties that many people—there are several in my constituency—have in paying the large sums for farms bought in the early 1970s at that interest of 14 per cent. Admittedly the prices for those farms were too high, but they were the going prices at the time.<br><br>
I once again ask the Minister to give this matter careful consideration. The wording of the amendment may not be exactly right, but the Government have, I believe, directors on the AMC and they know the workings of that body. All Governments have supported it, and I believe that its request to the Government for support in these new moves should be backed to the hilt as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Fred Peart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) and the hon. Members for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) and for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) for the thoughtful and constructive way in which they presented their case.<br><br>
Reference was made to the Select Committee. I agree with the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West, that the section of its report dealing with the sources of finance, the alternative sources of cash to pay tax, the strictures on the wealth tax and capital transfer tax and the evidence presented by the body we are discussing today, should be read by every member of this Committee. It is important that the Government should take note. I do not dissent from that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Buckingham rightly pointed out some of the dangers to agriculture arising from taxation policies, and this was elaborated on by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West. I agree that we must be very careful. I, too, am worried that any pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
posals of the kind which have been mentioned will lead to fragmentation. I said that when the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) and I discussed this matter on Border Television. I committed myself when I said to him, and said to the farming community, that I would make certain that the proposals would not lead to fragmentation. I have made representations and discussed this with my colleagues.<br><br>
I am being frank with the Committee. I am concerned about this. In the end, as hon. Members know, an inter-departmental committee was set up. I cannot, of course, reveal the conclusions of that committee. My Department, Ministers and officials, are well aware of the dangers to our farm structure. In no way would I like to see that structure harmed. After all, I brought in a bill which sought to promote amalgamation. Perhaps that amalgamation policy was not pursued as vigorously as it should have been. I do not criticise successive Governments or, indeed, my own position. The proposals were far-reaching. The Bill was a great innovation which was welcomed by the farming community. Of course we do not want fragmentation if this would harm investment and harm the industry, and I recognise the arguments that have been put by hon. Members.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
As regards the wealth tax I accept that we must ensure that investment in agriculture is not harmed or frustrated. The Select Committee on the tax has reported. There has been a postponement which will enable the incidence of this tax to be looked at again. If I were to discuss taxation generally I should be out of order, but I can say that the Government have taken note of agricultural needs in relation to capital transfer tax and other tax measures.<br><br>
In framing wealth tax policies we must recognise that here we are dealing with a most sensitive aspect of the industry, the need to encourage investment and to provide profitability for producers who work an organisation that can react to weather and who were considerably affected by causes outside their control. We should therefore be extremely sensitive about any proposals. My colleagues are just as aware of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
problems as are members of the Opposition; and those who have spoken on this have done so because of their own important experience in the industry.<br><br>
The purpose of Clause 2 is to provide for further advances to be made to the guarantee fund so that the Corporation can continue to borrow money to on-lend to farmers on a long-term basis. it is intended simply to enable the Corporation to continue its present important function.<br><br>
As hon. Members have made clear, the amendment and the new clause introduce two entirely new proposals—first, that the AMC should, by legislation, be enabled to implement its co-owner-ship proposals; and secondly—that the AMC should set up a mutual funded farming bank. Moreover, under the terms of the amendment, implementation of these proposals is made a condition precedent to action on the original purpose of the clause. May I deal with the two proposals in the order in which they appear in the amendment?<br><br>
The main point which I think has been made in the discussion on the co-ownership proposal is that legislation is needed, because the AMC can lend only on first mortgage. I appreciate the difficulty seen by hon. Members. Nevertheless, my hon. Friend was correct when he stated on second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>…I am advised that legislation would not be needed to enable the Corporation to proceed with the proposals in their present form."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, <i>c.</i> 1344.]</p></blockquote>
The company structure which the AMC would propose to adopt is a fairly complicated one but, basically, it consists of a triangular formation. At the apex of the triangle would be a holding company—AMC (Holdings) Limited. At one side of the base would be the AMC in its present form, unchanged and continuing its present functions. At the other side would be the complex of organisations needed to implement the co-ownership scheme. The most important of these would be a unit trust management company which it is intended to call the AMC (Agriland) Trust Limited.<br><br>
The consent of the existing shareholders of the AMC to the transfer of their shares to the holding company would obviously be required to set up this structure. But no legislation is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
needed because the AMC itself would continue its present functions unchanged.<br><br>
May I add that, in moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge said that the Corporation states with the utmost force and clarity that it has not the constitutional powers to proceed. I do not know the source of the hon. Member's assertion. Statements may have been made, but I can only state that the information I have given the Committee is based on the best legal advice, that we have explained the position to the corporation, and that it has not dissented from our view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be contentious, because I am sure we must seek an answer, but the Minister has entirely sidestepped the question of the debenture trustees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to explain the basic structure which will be proposed. I have answered this immediately because it was raised in the debate on Second Reading and has been raised again. I have just given what I think is the situation and I hope that hon. Members will understand that I am not trying to sidestep anything. These points will naturally be discussed when we also discuss "clause stand part".<br><br>
The second point made by hon. Members was that the co-ownership scheme was intended to reduce the impact of capital taxation, that it had the enthusiastic support of the Ministry, and that there was therefore a conflict of Government policy. The reference to "enthusiastic support" which was quoted by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge comes, I understand, from a publicity handout made by the AMC in September last.<br><br>
The statements which the AMC makes, whether in its publicity material, in its annual report, or whenever it may he, are its responsibility. I have given the Committee the legal advice I have had, and that is the situation.<br><br>
These statements by AMC are not the responsibility of my Ministry. My position can be simply stated. I recognise the purpose of the AMC's proposal and can see that it could have certain advantages, but it also presents real difficulties. I shall explain the difficulties to hon. Members shortly, when I have dealt with the points made in moving
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
the amendment. That is why no decision on the proposal has yet been taken.<br><br>
Another point which hon. Members made was that AMC's co-ownership proposal was necessitated by the demands of capital taxation. That was a fair point, but it is not strictly correct. It is true that the money obtained by a farmer under the co-ownership scheme could be used to meet any capital taxation demands made upon him. 'This has been said in AMC's recent publicity material, and I accept that it is fair. But the money could equally well be used for investment in the farm, for working capital, or for any other purpose, depending on the needs and obligations of the farmer.<br><br>
Why have not the Government agreed that the co-ownership scheme should be implemented? The difficulties arise, not because of the need for legislation, but because the proposal raises a number of problems of some complexity. These problems result from the fact that the AMC, in its present form, is Government-backed and is known to be so. It is also known that, when the AMC was faced with financial problems in the late 1930s, the Government came to its help. The new subsidiary which the AMC proposes to establish to run the co-owner-ship scheme would be entirely independent of the Government, but it would bear the name of the AMC. Indeed, for goodwill reasons, the AMC is anxious that it should.<br><br>
Two main difficulties therefore arise. First, farmers might be misled into thinking that the AMC's subsidiary to which they were selling a share in the equity of their land, was a similar organisation to the AMC and therefore had a measure of Government support. Secondly, although it might be made clear at the outset that the two organisations were separate, there might in practice be complications for the Government of the day if the new organisation got into financial difficulties.<br><br>
I emphasise that this is not a matter of party politics. Some of the AMC's proposals were put forward under a previous Administration, and I assume that it was the same considerations which prevented that Administration from taking a decision. It is a matter of ensuring that no one is misled; that the Government do not become involved in further financialcommitments—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is quite right. This is a Treasury argument, not a party argument. Why cannot the Treasury underwrite the trust and the trust pay a reasonable underwriting fee for so doing? That is the way round this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made a powerful intervention. However, as I have said, it is not the Government's intention to get involved in further financial commitments. I cannot go beyond that. We must recognise, too, that the ability of the AMC to discharge its present valuable functions is not impaired. I do not say that these difficulties are insuperable, but they need careful consideration.<br><br>
On the question of trustees—I hope that I am not sidetracking this matter, because it was raised by the hon. Member—debenture trustees would not be affected under the proposed structure. But if the AMC itself undertook the co-ownership scheme the trust deed would come up, and the debenture holder would have rights over the farms in which the AMC had taken up equity holdings.<br><br>
Coming to another matter, I agree that the problems would not arise if the banks—mention has been made of the role of banks which are the shareholders of the AMC or, for that matter, any other financial institutions or individuals—were to set up a co-ownership scheme provided the new organisation was entirely separate from the AMC, and provided that it conformed to the requirements of the Companies Acts. The difficulties about the AMC's present proposal arise because the corporation wants to link the new organisation with the original AMC.<br><br>
The second part of the amendment deals with the proposal for a land bank. There are two aspects here: the setting up of the bank itself and the provision of subsidised credit. A Government initiative to encourage the creation of a United Kingdom land bank as such would be justified only if existing banking facilities were inadequate. There is no evidence to suggest that this is so. Our system of joint stock banks, with a network of branches all over the country, makes adequate provision for short-term lending to any farmer who is able to service a loan.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0070">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
The question of subsidising interest rates, too, is a separate matter. I appreciate that, at a time when interest rates are high in this country, hon. Members on both sides of the House begin to consider more closely the subsidised rates of interest which obtain in most other Member States of the European Community. Reference, again, was made to this matter on Second Reading.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend made clear on Second Reading—this is HANSARD, 1st December 1975, column 1343—the rules of competition within the Community provide that, for investments covered by the Farm Modernisation Directive—72/159/EEC—the national aid can be in the form of an interest rate rebate or an equivalent value grant or, as happens in a number of cases, a combination of both kinds of help. The important point, however, is that there should be no advantage either way.<br><br>
Traditionally, the United Kingdom has provided assistance in the form of capital grants which can benefit all farmers rather than in the form of subsidised credit, which benefits only those farmers who borrow. Although I know that the National Farmers' Union has been thinking seriously about this matter, our present understanding is that, although it and the other farming organisations would naturally be glad to have subsidised credit in addition to capital grants, they prefer to retain capital grants, if they have to make a choice between the two.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
I am sure, therefore, that hon. Members will appreciate that any proposal to change our system would be a matter which would require the most careful consideration and consultation both as to its usefulness in the United Kingdom and as to the best means of implementing it, if it were ultimately decided that a change was desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear that the question whether we go for subsidised credit or capital grants in the future is one that will engage the attention of the House and, indeed, all the agricultural professional bodies in forthcoming years. But does the Minister also accept that the present opinions being given by professional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
bodies are based on current rates and that, in fact, a statistical comparison can be made only when there is some positive indication from the Government of the day as to what the rates for subsidised credit or for capital grants might be and a true comparison actually worked out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that argument. As I have said, the farming community as such has not really made up its mind on this, although there have been discussions. For the present the Government believe that capital grants are preferred.<br><br>
Moreover, it does not follow that the AMC, which is essentially an institution for lending long term, will be the right vehicle for this purpose and, unlike the co-ownership scheme, for such a purpose extensive legislative changes would be needed. It would certainly be inappropriate to attempt to make provision for such a far-reaching change in a clause the basic purpose of which is very different.<br><br>
Apart from these considerations, however, I am advised that the amendment as it stands is defective on two counts. First, in the fifth line it refers to " approved agricultural purposes " but does not make clear who is responsible for giving the approval. Secondly—and this point is perhaps the more important—it makes it a condition precedent to any action by the Minister that a mutual funded bank should be providing credit:
<br><blockquote><p>"on terms comparable to those available from similar institutions in other member countries".</p></blockquote>
Leaving aside the difficulties introduced by the words "terms comparable" the amendment apparently means that each time the Minister wanted to make an advance to the guarantee fund of the AMC, he would have first to make sure that the United Kingdom mutual funded bank was lending at terms comparable to a similar institution elsewhere in the Community.<br><br>
I recognise that these are questions of wording, though they would be important if the amendment were to be accepted. But, for the reasons which I have already given, I propose that the amendment should be rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we can let the matter go at that, despite the length and the trouble to which the Minister has gone in replying to the debate so far. Discussions between the AMC and administrations have been taking place since
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
1970. Surely it is now high time that matters were brought to a head.<br><br>
In 1970 the tax legislative burden was much less onerous than what is experienced at present and what, indeed, might be threatening, which makes it all the more reason for having this matter sorted out.<br><br>
The Minister made some play with problems. He said, first, that the AMC is, in effect, Government-backed and known to be so and that it would follow that in this triangular structure which he described any new subsidiary of a new holding company would have the same aura and status that now attaches to the AMC itself and that would be a difficulty. Let us take that on board and some others which the Minister did not cope with but which are much more to the point and are real impediments at the present time.<br><br>
To dispose of the question of the new subsidiary requiring the same aura ofstatus of the existing AMC, I am sure that agreement could be reached with the AMC so to restrict the liabilities of the new subsidiary company that in the event of any disaster there would be limited, if indeed any, overspill and that that could be appropriately underwritten in any event. I fail to see why this could not and should not be made utterly clear in any literature or any dealings that the AMC or the new holding company might have. I regard that argument as a pure technicality which is susceptible of solution.<br><br>
The nub of the problem is whether the AMC has the legal and constitutional powers to proceed; and, if so, by what means? The Minister's advice, if I understood him, is that the AMC has powers. I am doubtful. I have looked at the evidence on this. I have before me the memorandum and articles of association of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. I also have a specimen of a 1929 debenture trust deed. The remainder since then have been numerous but they follow the pattern.<br><br>
It strikes me—bearing in mind that the principal object laid down for the AMC in its memorandum and articles has been lending on first mortgage—that were the AMC to proceed without the subsidiary company structure, now indicated in its literature and negotiated with the Minister, there would have to be very extensive and laborious negotiations with all the trustees of the debenture holders. I am not sure whether the debenture holders individually have to be consulted, but I am sure that all the trustees of the various debentures
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
would have to give their clearance in this matter. This would be laborious and unnecessary if one contemplates the alternative which is in the mind of the AMC and must be known in some considerable detail to the Minister and his officials.<br><br>
The ideal would be to set up a new holding company. That new holding company would simply capitalise itself by a process of a straight one-for-one share exchange with the existing shareholders in the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, they being the clearing banks and the Bank of England. As far as I can establish, the existing shareholders in AMC would agree to this course of action and what would follow. That is not to say that they are committed in precise detail, but my understanding is that in the round they would be entirely happy to pursue this course of action.<br><br>
That would then produce, in terms of the company's structure, a holding company with one limb being the AMC, as at present constituted and so continuing with the position of the debenture holders entirely unimpaired, legally or in any other way. The new holding company which will be thrown up by this process would then be at liberty, given the new memorandum and articles which would attach to that new holding company, to form a fresh subsidiary. Hence the triangular pattern to which the Minister referred—the holding company, the AMC continuing, and a new subsidiary whose principal activity would be the financing and implementation of this co-ownership idea about which we are talking.<br><br>
The essence of this is partly legal but is basically to do with the attitude of the Minister. Does he want this to happen or not? The practicalities of the situation dictate the formation of a holding company, bearing in mind the contents of the existing memorandum and articles and the debenture trust deeds. The shareholders in the AMC, as at present constituted, are willing to participate in a straight share exchange upwards to the holding company. There would then be formed a fresh subsidiary company specialising in the development of this co-ownership plan.<br><br>
Can the Minister be persuaded to return to this argument? I hope we shall not just depart, turn our backs on each other this morning and have a continuing wrangle during Report stage.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
I am deliberately directing my remarks to New Clause 2 because the generalities of the amendment as such are useful in terms of a discussion in the broad, but I think we are concerned specifically about new Clause 2. My feeling, Mr. Costain, would be that as and when we come to vote on that your decision will be that this discussion has pre-empted further discussion thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So we must be quite specific on what we are now talking about, and I see that the Minister is nodding his assent. I should like him, if he feels able to do so, to come back to the specific points relating to New Clause 2, if he is genuinely in sympathy with the objectives of co-ownership, and there has been no indication in any literature I have seen that he is averse to that. The only indication was, perhaps, this association of the Government name with co-ownership plans, and I am sure that situation could be safeguarded both in terms of financial delimitation and financial underwriting, and also in terms of the name given to the co-ownership organisation and the literature which it issues. In all of these ways, with that argument the Minister now puts forward perhaps he is confused about all the difficulties we had with the former Secretary of State for Trade and compensating people who had lost their holidays because it was held that the Secretary of State responsible had said something.<br><br>
There is clearly something in the argument that the AMC is Government-backed and known to be so. I reverse the argument It is all the more important that the Minister now faces up to his responsibilities and clears the path for the formation of the holding company, which in turn will allow the AMC to carry on, unimpaired as it is now, plus another separate subsidiary, and enter in its own right into pursuing the co-ownership idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot compete with my colleague's erudite contribution. I should like to ask the Minister two questions. The first concerns the completion of the inter-departmental inquiry on a wealth tax to which he referred. Has this inquiry been completed and is it to be published?<br><br>
Secondly, on the point we are now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
discussing, has the Minister, or his Ministers, met the AMC on this request it has put forward, with the objective of trying to iron out the difficulties?<br><br>
I and my colleagues and, I believe, everyone on the Committee, hope that the Minister feels that now is the time to strike out with some fresh thinking on the financing of land, and on many other matters. This is something that with thought and care could easily be resolved. I can see the points the Minister raised, and he made a very thoughtful contribution to our debate, but I hope to hear him say "We are in favour of this if the AMC wants to do it and we will try to help it along". We want to see some positive thinking and I hope that the Minister will feel able to reply "Yes, we will have talks. We will try to make this work if humanly possible".</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Micheal Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are very grateful to the Minister for coming to the Committee this morning. I know that he has had to attend very important talks very shortly and it is not our wish to delay him unduly.<br><br>
One of the great advantages of Bills of this sort is that at Committee stage there can be fundamental discussions about some of the most important matters which concern the agricultural industry. I think we all realise the limitations of the Bill. It was interesting that, during the course of his speech, the Minister said that he thought that the new clause was too wide for the Bill. Perhaps I should be out of order if I were to go too far on New Clause 1, but I direct the Minister'sattention to the matter. I know that the Minister has studied the short discussion we had at the beginning of this Committee stage about New Clause 1. If he is arguing that New Clause 2 is too wide for the Bill, I can only take it that he is following precisely the argument that I, and I think others, made about the importance of New Clause 1. However, Mr. Costain, you will be relieved to hear that I shall not pursue that argument further.<br><br>
Turning to the earlier part of the Minister's speech this morning, we were glad to hear his assurances about the dangers of fragmentation as a consequence of the capital taxation which has been put before us and which is proposed for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
future. He made rather similar noises about safeguarding investment.<br><br>
I refer the Minister to a report recently produced by the Country Landowners' Association which showed that 60 per cent. of planned investment in agriculture had been abandoned. I know that that was at the depth of the depression last summer, but a good deal of that 60 per cent. was due to the impact and the fear of capital taxation in the future. I hope that he will keep that matter closely in mind, but we were pleased to hear what he has said in this respect this morning. But actions speak louder than words and, although we welcome his words, we hope that actions will follow.<br><br>
I come back to the remarks that have been made this morning about the co-ownership scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) has already expressed many of the questions which one is tempted to ask the Minister following his speech. He is rightly making sure that a company or public corporation with the degree of Government backing which the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation has must be very jealous to make sure that in no way can public confidence be disappointed by any actions in the change of function which that corporation should pursue. Of course we accept that.<br><br>
I believe that the proposition of the co-ownership scheme could be carried out under certain terms which would in no way dilute public confidence and need not mortgage in any way the blue chip standing of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. If the co-ownership scheme were backed, as the Minister suggested, by AMC (Agriland) Trust Limited, if it carried a separate name, if it were organised by a company which, although associated with AMC, was drawn up in a way whereby the interests of the debenture holders were completely safeguarded, I do not see why it should not be pursued. It is not beyond the ingenuity of those who are concerned with the financing of such companies and the structure of finance companies of this sort to put it in a way which would not in any way jeopardise the public's confidence and the Government's position in these matters.<br><br>
The Minister said that at this time he must not let the Government into further financial commitments. We quite understand that the Government are now rightly seeking to reduce expenditure, or rather to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
cut back any increases in public expenditure. I accept and applaud that policy. It is a little late in the day, but it is, I believe, quite right. But will the Minister tell us whether his remark about not encouraging this scheme arose because of what we hope will be the short-term position? If things took a turn for the better over the next few years and the Government were not so determined as they now seem to be not to be led into further financial commitments, might the position change? Is his remark entirely due to the present financial position, and might the position change in the future?<br><br>
I want to add a few remarks about subsidised credit. This gives all of us who are interested in agriculture a good deal of food for thought. As the Minister said, many organisations connected with the industry are wondering whether we might be better off with subsidised credit in place of the present system of capital grants.<br><br>
The Minister said that the amendment was drafted in a defective way. He well knows that this is not uncommon in amendments drafted by Oppositions, and we are in no way daunted by that. Nor, I guess, was he, on many occasions when he found himself in this seat. But it gives us an opportunity to have this debate, which is extremely apposite at this moment.<br><br>
It is not the Opposition's policy to move farm capital grants over to a system of subsidised credit. I agree with the Minister that such a change would need careful consideration. It may be felt that, today, a changeover to subsidised credit would be a benefit to us, but the position may change completely within, say, two years. If we move in the future towards subsidised credit, we must be absolutely sure that it will be in the interests of the industry over a long period. Nothing could be more foolish than for us to set up some sort of land hank, to embark on a system of subsidised credit just because it appeared right on the day, and then to find, two or three years later, that we would have been better sticking to capital grants. Clearly, if a change is to be made in the future it must be done with careful consideration.<br><br>
With regard to the capital grant schemes, remarks have been made about the comparability of terms of subsidised credit with the rest of the countries within the Community. At the moment, our capital grants are set at a varying number of percentages of the approved cost. What is the position about changing the level of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0074">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
capital grants? Does this have to be done with the approval of the Community or, on the other hand, can the Government act entirely of their own volition? Again, the present level of capital grant is 20 per cent. as far as I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On buildings, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If for instance the Government wanted to increase the level to, say, 33 per cent. what is the position withregard to a change of that sort? Does the Minister feel that there would be objections in Brussels if this was wanted? Asfar as I have understood it, there would be no objections from Brussels, but it would be helpful to everybody—bothhere and outside—if we were to know whether the Government are free agents, as it were, to change the level ofcapital grants in that way.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister that we are far better off with capital grants now, and I am not convinced that it would be in the interests of the industry to change over to a system of subsidised credit. Therefore, it would be helpful if the Minister would comment on these matters, and we are extremely grateful, as I said earlier, to him for the remarks he made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the point of Government liability I discern once again the dead hand of the Treasury. I tend to be a little unjust to the Minister. I do not think that it is he who is trying to stop it but the Treasury. My experience is in another area where we tried to get similar financial arrangements for the voluntary housing movement. The fact that the Americans do this time and time again with the Federal Housing Administration, and so on, never seems to percolate in this country.<br><br>
The proposed scheme is between 10 per cent. and 49 per cent. Therefore, any liability can arise only if the value of landfalls by half. I appreciate that that is a possibility, but the potential liability is so small that an ordinary commercial underwriting operation could easily cover it, and this would obviously be a charge on the scheme itself.<br><br>
What I should like the Minister to say is this. We have heard what everybody has said this morning. Let us go away and have another think about it and have further discussions. I feel that just to sweep the matter away would be a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
great mistake and a great detriment to the farming industry as a whole.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a practical farmer may I declare my interest here this morning, as I have done many times previously? Coming from part of an area where the majority of farmers are owner-occupiers, many of us over a period have been very fortunate in the services given by the AMC to farmers in our constituency.<br><br>
I am making a plea once again—I made a plea about three weeks ago in the House—on behalf of small farmers. I am not worried initially about capital grants or interest rates. However, many farmers' sons and farm workers in this country are genuinely interested in becoming farmers and owning a piece of land so that they can farm in a small way and eventually become farmers in a large way.<br><br>
If the Minister believes in the White Paper "Food from Our Own Resources" he must help the youngsters in this country. Especially would he consider setting up a land bank? I would rather the AMC stood on its own feet and that the extra money be there for the farmers to benefit when they applied in future.<br><br>
I should like to see a land bank so that we could give risk capital to many genuine young farmers. I wonder whether the Minister would give more consideration to that suggestion. I shall tell the Committee a true story of one of my farm managers of a few years ago who, on his way home from Aberystwyth Market turned to me and said " Geraint, I would love to become a farmer myself."I said" Well, John, if you want to you can be. It is entirely up to you." Unfortunately, he had very little capital and wanted to know whether I could help in any way. I did my best to help him by going to the bank and trying various other places, but he was unable to obtain the capital required, although he had a few hundred pounds behind him. He is the type of man who is unable to become a farmer in this country and politicians should be willing to support the lending of capital on risk terms to these genuine youngsters who will become good farmers. I should like to hear the Minister's views on risk capital to the youngsters of this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members have made positive points, I accept what the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) said about a land bank, the need to help young farmers, and the need to supply risk capital. Any Government must examine such a proposal most carefully. There are no such proposals in the Bill, but it is a matter which should be looked at sympathetically. Indeed, I have a note before me about the importance of young farmers purchasing land and I have sympathy with the proposal and with the remarks made by the hon. Member.<br><br>
I know that it is difficult for young men to start in farming on their own, but the proposal regarding the AMC is not practical. That is why the hon. Member talked about a land bank. I assure the Committee that I will look at this and investigate this matter in relation to the European set-up as well, but we are not discussing that this morning.<br><br>
However, I have taken careful note of what the hon. Member has said. I know a lot about his constituency of Cardiganshire, which is similar to my own. It is an area of small owner-occupiers and tenant farmers. We have the problem of attracting young men into the industry, which is what we are all anxious to do.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) raised several questions. He talked about taxation. An inter-departmental committee has reported to me, but its report will not be published. The report will enable my colleagues and I to study the effects of the taxation proposals of the Government on farming. If necessary, action will be taken. The Government decided on the setting up of the Committee and this was welcomed by the Opposition. It is an inter-departmental committee report and, from his wide experience of political activity, the hon. Member knows that these reports are not published. Nevertheless, we recognise that this is a serious problem. The hon. Member asked me whether I intended to pursue the proposals suggested. Earlier I said that the difficulties are not necessarily insuperable. That was when I spoke of the reason the Government do not get involved in further financial commitments. I said also that the ability of the AMC to discharge its present functions must not be impaired. The hon. Member rightly quoted what I said. But I went on to say that although these difficulties are not insuperable, they need careful consideration. I can only leave it at that. I shall look at what has been said again and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
will carefully study individual contributions, as I said, in relation to that mentioned by the hon. Member for Cardigan. I shall look at this.<br><br>
I do not complain about the wording of the amendment, and I am not taunting the Opposition. I am not being arrogant here, because I was in Opposition for a long period. I hope I shall not be in it again and that the hon. Member will get more experience, which he needs, in Opposition. I recognise that drafting is a difficult task. But it has enabled us to have a fruitful debate. I cannot accept the amendment or the new clause, but I think we have had a most satisfactory debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say whether there are discussions taking place on these proposals of the AMC, whether they are continuing, whether they have started, and whether the Minister will endeavour to try to help to solve these problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been in touch with the Corporation. We will continue to have discussions and I shall ensure that our officials are aware of this, too. This is a most important matter for the industry and should not be dismissed.<br><br>
Mention was also made by the hon. Member of subsidised credit and capital grants and he asked specifically about the situation in Europe. If there are changes to be made to capital grants, the Community's attitude is that these are possible within fixed rules, but the rules are liberal. Specifically they deal with land improvement and buildings, where most of the investment falls. Actually we pay up to 25 per cent. on land improvement, so the European Community is quite liberal on this, and there is no opposition to the principle. Some people believed that the use of such grants could distort competition, but I have found no evidence that the Commission specifically, or the Community, is hostile to their use.<br><br>
The hon. Member also mentioned farm investment and quoted the dangers there and said that there had been a fall. My advice is that the present position is better than it was last summer. Our measures helped to improve the situation. Confidence is returning to the industry and we are now faced with a significant improvement in eligible investment, particularly in buildings. I am informed that we may need supplementary estimates due to increases in this sector.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) raised the question of the new structure. As I understand it, the structure proposed by the hon. Member will raise difficulties. The difficulty is that if the name of the AMC is used and if the structure is linked to the AMC all the problems originally outlined remain. That is what I argued in my opening speech. I was asked whether an agreement could be reached to make it clear that the liability of the AMC was limited. There would still be the risk that farmers and others might be misled.<br><br>
For various reasons, therefore, although I have sympathy with some of the points raised by hon. Members, I cannot accept the amendment and the new clause. But I assure the Committee that I shall continue discussions at departmental level on the matters raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply is deeply distressing, certainly in the context of the AMC. Effectively, as the technical side of AMC is associated in the minds of farmers and others with the Government, what other vehicle would he suggest might perform this function? I can think of none more and of none other.<br><br>
Therefore, it was with deep regret that we heard the Minister conclude on that note.<br><br>
It is not our intention to pursue the matter any further, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, at the same time reserving the rights of the Opposition in relation to New Clause 2.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 30, leave out £13 million ' and insert £20 million'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 33, leave out "£30 million" ' and insert "£37 million"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that these amendments will present any difficulty. They are purely exploratory. The last time the financial structure of the AMC was looked at was under the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in 1972. One wonders what the reasoning was then and what the reasoning is now. What is God-given about the figure that has been chosen in the Bill? How does that equate in the Minister's mind with the White
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
Paper "Food from Our Own Resources" and, indeed, with inflation and the impact of all that on farming finance? That is the essence of Amendments Nos. 8 and 9. How has the Minister reached these figures? How do they fit in with the discussions in 1972? How long a period does he think they will see us through?<br><br>
There are supplementary matters to which I may return in terms of the guaranteed base of Government moneys for raising finance on the market, but with those words I think I have adequately introduced Amendments Nos. 8 and 9.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the observations of the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) are relevant to the amendment and to the clause.<br><br>
The hon. Member moved the amendment briefly and fairly. The effect of it is to increase the additional advances which the Minister may make initially to the guarantee fund, from £13 million to £20 million, and the total of the advances which may be made, from £30 million to £37 million. I take it that that is the purport of the amendment. As no alteration is made to sub-section (2) I take it that the final total of £40 million still stands. The Minister would, therefore, be empowered by subsection (1) to advance up to £37 million, and by subsection (2) to advance a further £3 million—that is from £37 million to £40 million—by. Order, with the consent of the Treasury.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked what was the magic of the figures in the Bill. One should consider what my right hon. Friend has needed to take into account to assess the figures. In some ways, the amount which the Minister should be authorised by Parliament to advance is an arbitrary matter. It is a matter of trying to get the best estimate, but it depends upon the estimate that can be made of the sums that the AMC is likely to want to borrow to meet the farmers' needs over the next five to 10 years. The provision made in the clause for an initial increase of £13 million to a total of £30 million provides a sum which should enable the AMC to borrow approximately £175 million. We think that that will be sufficient to last until about 1980. The additional provision for a further £10 million should enable the AMC to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
borrow a further £130 million, approximately, so that overall provision is made in the clause to enable the AMC to seek additional borrowings of about £300 million. I think the hon. Gentleman and others will agree that, so far as one can tell in relation to future needs of the industry and the role of the AMC in relation to other agencies from which farmers can borrow, that is an adequate provision.<br><br>
Moreover, the amendments as they stand to not increase the overall ceiling of £40 million set out in subsection (2). The only effect of the amendments, therefore, is to give the Minister power initially to advance £20 million instead of £13 million and thereafter, with the approval of Parliament, to advance a further £3 million instead of £10 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very conscious that he is splitting hairs. He must realise that the amendments are not exhaustive. They are simply probing amendments. In this exercise one does not perambulate through the hills of a Bill with all the consequential amendments. Will he please shut up on the faulty amendment and get on with explaining what is so sacrosanct about the figure that he has chosen in subsection (1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is rather an uncalled-for outburst so early in the New Year. I do not wish to labour the point, but the hon. Gentleman spoke very briefly about his amendment. I have tried to be cooperative and to the job for him and to explain to my hon. Friends and the Committee what he might have said. I hope that he does not think I have misrepresented his case. If he has a further case to put he may pursue it, but the details of the case, its substance and merit were not put in a way that does justice to the amendment. I realise that it is a probing amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not take it amiss that I was trying to help him.<br><br>
I am not splitting hairs, and I make the point again that my hon. Friend has had to try to assess the needs of the farming industry over the years up to the 1980s. On the forecasts of needs that we have, and on our estimate of the other areas from which the industry may borrow, we think that as far as the AMC is concerned these figures are about right. Of course it is a matter of judgment, and I hope that my explanation of the hon. Gentleman's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
amendments will encourage him not to pursue them. Meanwhile, I hope that I have given him the information which he seeks on what I consider to be, a probing amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It looks as though I am left on my own. I have been reading with great interest and refreshing my memory from the green book which costs £9.50. It is a study under the signature of Professor J. S. G. Wilson entitled "Availability of capital and credit to United Kingdom Agriculture". There is a most interesting passage in that study on the activities of the AMC and the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation. I had hoped that the Minister, instead of just saying " We have had a look at this and it is fairly arbitrary but that seems about it and it should get us through to 1980", learned dissertation and not concentrated on the lack of consequential amendments by the Opposition.<br><br>
I should have thought that, on the face of them, the purpose of the amendments was explicit; namely, to flush out the reasons for the choice of the figures in the Bill. The operative figures that will bite are in subsection (1). If one wishes to criticise the drafting, one can say that we have to deal with a most unusual Money Resolution. I was astounded when I discovered that I could table amendments to it. Perhaps the Minister will explain why we have this unique Money Resolution governing the proceedings on the Bill.<br><br>
I should like to reflect on the Minister's words, which have not been as helpful as they should have been. This is a complex Bill, as Professor Wilson's study shows, and I would have hoped that this discussion would have given the Ministry an opportunity, in a short space of time, to cast considerable light on the updated situation of farming finance.<br><br>
There have been some great upheavals in sources of credit, especially from the suppliers of equipment and from traders, dealers and suppliers generally. There has been a great tightening of the money supply. The cash flow situation in the agriculture industry has undergone a sea change of great proportions. I should have thought that the Minister would have welcomed this opportunity to comment on the situation in relation to the AMC's role. Admittedly it is longer term financing, but I, as an industrialist, am often bewildered about where bank loans
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
merge into permanent financing. I think that by concentrating on the inadequacy of the amendment concerning subsection (2) the Minister has foregone a useful opportunity to enlighten the Committee and the whole of the agriculture industry on the state of credit in farming; the cash flow situation in farming as seen through the eyes of the Ministry.<br><br>
It is with great disappointment that we have heard the hon. Gentleman's reply. I hope that we may be able to return to this matter either on " clause stand part " or on Report. In the meantime, the appropriate step is for me to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a helpful and useful discussion on certain parts of the future role of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, and it would be helpful now if the Government would give us some answers about how they see the Corporation acting under its present responsibilities.<br><br>
When we discussed this matter on Second Reading I drew attention to the rather surprising fact that 9 per cent, of the agricultural land in this country has on it a loan of one sort or another from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. That has always been a surprise to me. It is a tribute to the way in which the Corporation goes about its business, unobtrusively and helpfully. Without the activities of the Corporation we would not get as much production as we do from our own resources.<br><br>
Over the past few years there have been some fairly dramatic changes in the price structure of land and interest rates. A few years ago, good agricultural land could be bought for £300 an acre, but the price then shot up quickly to £1,000 an acre. I suspect that from the point of view of most owner-occupier farmers the increase in the price of land was a mixed blessing. Apart from making it rather easier to talk to the bank manager I think that there was nothing much in it for most farmers, because for most owner-occupiers there is no great advantage in going to bed at night knowing that one is worth £50,000 or £100,000 more than one was worth two years ago. Most owner-occupiers have no intention of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
selling their farms; it is purely a paper matter.<br><br>
The increase in land prices from the point of view of our previous system of estate duties created immense difficulties. The despair in other industries when the price of land came down from £1,000 an acre to about half that figure, as it has done in the last two years, was not found in the agriculture industry, because to many farmers it meant merely that they were neither better nor worse off. The bank manager perhaps then became more difficult to talk to as a result of the drop in land prices, but the problems of estate duty or capital transfer tax became rather less.<br><br>
This all could create difficulties for the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, because a number of farmers bought land when the price was at the top. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) in his professional capacity knows a little about this. Some farmers who bought land at £1,000 an acre or more and borrowed money from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to do it find themselves on the wrong end of the stick now that prices have fallen to about half the previous figure. I am concerned that substantial losses might be caused to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation as a result of the rapid fall in land prices following their just as rapid increase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the real problem facing farmers is not the fact that they bought land at £1,000 an acre and it is now back to £400, but that the return they are getting from the massive investment they made is totally unrealistic. This surely is the problem, not that the land has fallen in value. One cannot spend land; one can only spend the income received from what is produced on that land.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that point, but the difficulty is that some farmers might have borrowed from the AMC a sum of money larger than the amount that the land may now be worth. That was the wrong end of the stick to which I referred.<br><br>
I realise that borrowing money at £1,000 an acre and the interest rate on that sum make it difficult for anyone to farm effectively in order to repay that money. I should have thought that it would be virtually impossible to repay that money. There are probably very few people who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0079">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
have borrowed the whole of £1,000 an acre—probably they would have borrowed on only part of it—but if anyone didborrow as much as £1,000 an acre and then stocked the land and tried to pay off the interest rates, I should call that as near an impossibility as anything that I could think of, unless that land was covered in concrete, with a specialist market gardening crop, or even with glass. For normal general farming it would be a total impossibility. I should be surprised if anyone had borrowed as much as £1,000 an acre.<br><br>
I was concerned, and suggested on Second Reading, that, as a consequence of this latest fall in prices, the Corporation might find itself with some bad debts. I referred in c. 1285 to the Corporation's accounts which showed that last year £18,000 was written off for bad debts, and said that £328,000 was set aside for future debts. It would be helpful if the Minister could give us some idea of what is happening about bad debts. Will the Corporation have to write off £328,000, and is that a consequence of the recent fall in the value of land?<br><br>
As I said on Second Reading, I had a word with an official of the Corporation. He thought that there would not be many more bad debts to come as a consequence of the fall in land prices, so I hope that the worst of those consequences is over and that the Corporation will not have many more bad debts to write off.<br><br>
I want to draw attention to the interest rates charged by the Corporation. The Minister will be aware that the Corporation announced on, I think, 1st December, that the lending rate for both new and existing variable rate loans was going up from 13 per cent. to 14 per cent. One could argue that the Corporation is increasing interest rates against the current trend of falling interest rates. I believe that all the joint stock banks have now lowered their minimum lending rates. It seems slightly incongruous if the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation increases interest rates at the same time as the banks are reducing theirs.<br><br>
Some clarification of the position would be helpful, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said, the amount of money that has to be returned in interest rates each year is a serious matter to a farmer with a large loan outstanding to the Corporation on which he has to find the interest each year. It is important that the rates which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
Corporation charges are competitive compared with the rates charged by the joint stock bank.<br><br>
There are a number of questions there, no doubt some of my hon Friends will have other questions to put, and we look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) in saying that the AMC is an excellent organisation. I declare a non-interest. I am not a valuer for the AMC, as one of my colleagues suggested when I was praising it. I should very much like to be, but I never have been.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend probably will become one now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Well, perhaps I might.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A "commercial" would be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to confirm what my hon. Friend said and what other hon. Members in this Committee know to be a fact. High-priced land was not of benefit to the community. It enabled one to bolster up one's confidence in meeting one's bank manager on occasion and to go to bed with dreams of being a great capitalist, and so on, but nobody ever sold his land to cash in on those high prices with the purpose of getting out and going into some other business. Land was bought, and borrowings were made on it one has only to think of borrowing £500 an acre on land costing £800 an acre, which was quite a possibility—but the price has now dropped back to £500 an acre, as we all realise.<br><br>
What is the interest that has to be found at 14 per cent.? It is £70 an acre—five times £14, if I have worked it out correctly. What ordinary farming operations can be carried out not only to make a profit and meet the ordinary overheads, but to pay a rent of £70 an acre? That is on only two-thirds of the original cost of the land. Somebody else has had to provide the other £300 an acre and that is something that must be thought of very seriously.<br><br>
I have had one example in my constituency recently of disaster on a farm of 2,000 acres bought not in the high times, but in 1963 or 1964. As the land increased in value the farmer expanded his farm and had large dairy herds, and so on, but now
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0080">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
the whole thing has gone. The Ministry knew about it. I sought its advice and tried to stave off disaster. The lender in this case was not the AMC, but a bank, and unfortunately the whole thing has gone now. Production has gone at that big holding.<br><br>
The Minister spoke of the possibility of altering grant schemes; of altering the size of the percentage grant from 20 to perhaps 30, and said that it would not be a difficult proposition. Is he not concerned about the present land drainage grant scheme? I have had considerable difficulties in my area. The new scheme, which is an EEC scheme, has introduced the most immense difficulties into the farming world. After the wet weather of last year we wanted to carry out a number of drainage schemes this year but it was found that the capital required for new tractors and equipment was so great that the schemes have not yet been carried out.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister is aware that the new drainage grant system is not working properly. I hope, too, that he will take the matter up strongly at Brussels and get a sensible system which farmers can understand. One farmer and Ministry advisers have been considering one proposal for four months and have not yet been able to come up with a scheme that is practical for the man to carry out without the expenditure of an enormous sum of additional capital for new equipment. I hope that that can be looked into.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton), whose constituency we all get slightly out of order, was expecting me to follow him on the last two amendments, but I would like, finally to ask which organisations the Ministry took into its calculations in saying that only a certain sum of money was needed to carry the fund through until the 1980s. Livestock suppliers and others used to give an immense amount of credit until a few years ago, but that is now impossible. I know that fertiliser manufacturers, machinery merchants, and so on, used to give a large amount of credit, but they cannot do so today because of the cash flow situation in their firms. I therefore wonder what other organisations the Minister has in mind as being able to help finance farming, and the length of time involved. It will be reasonable if this gets us through to the 1980s. Looking ahead five or six years is about as far
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
as anyone can expect. If we could have more details of how the Minister arrived at that decision it would be helpful to the whole Committee, and to many people outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) and Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) both referred to the interest charged to borrowers by the AMC. There is an interesting paragraph on page 136 of this expensive document which is published under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"But the position is not now as favourable as was formerly the case. For many years, the AMC was able to borrow at rates only about ¼ per cent. above the rates on gilt-edged. When gilts became free of capital gains tax (in April 1969), which AMC stocks are not, the differential widened to ½ per cent. Indeed, in 1970, AMC had to pay 1 per cent. over the gilt rate. This was a consequence of the difficulties then experienced by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, since—although the latter has no connection with agriculture—these events did cause investors to look more closely at underlying realities and the stocks of the Board were unfortunately for the AMC dealt with in the same market as were AMC stocks. The effect has been that the raising of AMC funds has become more expensive and it has therefore had to charge its borrowers higher rates."</p></blockquote>
I believe that that is important and pertinent to this debate and I hope that the Minister will comment on the matter.<br><br>
It is, I believe, a fact that agriculture, and those involved in agriculture producing for the consumers of this country, get less for what they produce than does any other commercial undertaking—that is, their return on investment involved is smaller than in any other commercial sector—yet they are supposed to produce more and cope with the spiralling rates of inflation.<br><br>
That is an important point, and clearly the rates charged by the AMC are particularly important to farmers who want to expand, wanting, as it were, to take up the challenge which the Minister issued in his document "Food from Our Own Resources". I therefore hope that he will briefly comment on that.<br><br>
Finally, I take up the point raised by the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) which I believe is important to the future of agriculture and no doubt to other matters which the Government are considering. I hope that the Government will heed the importance of getting young people to come into agriculture, and the absolute impossible position in which they find themselves at the present time. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
cannot obtain the money to get into agriculture and, as I said, take up the challenge of the Minister and add a young image to farming.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
This is particularly important in areas such as that represented by the Minister himself and the hon. Member for Cardigan. We want new people to come into agriculture. I hope that on this matter, which the Minister promised to look at, we will not just get one of those casual assurances given to a Committee, or to the House, in order to buy time, but that it will be looked at soon, constructively and positively by the Minister. The future food supplies of this country depend upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the money market as a whole, and how the AMC is at present fitting into the spectrum. I am concerned in particular about losses as a result of what is known as loan reflux.<br><br>
There is now a diminishing bank rate, as it used to be called, or minimum lending rate as the clearing banks call it, and on looking at the capital structure of AMC and its £20 million of 1984 14¼ per cent. borrowings—admittedly with another £30 million raised on variable terms—one is entitled to ask for the Minister's comments on the loan situation and potential losses in that regard. It could be a matter of some moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Colin Phipps</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is saying reinforces to some extent the point that he is making, but is he aware that the variable interest rate that is applied by the AMC has been increased by 1 per cent. in recent weeks, while the actual rate of interest is coming down?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the AMC operates on an actuarial basis. I am sure, too, that it has considered the situation and endeavoured to protect itself. It may be that this movement particularly arises from the loan reflux situation. From the outside one can only make assumptions about that. We are privileged in having with us this morning a Minister of State who can, as it were, from the inside illumine the Committee as to precisely what is going on.<br><br>
My second point is, perhaps, of greater importance. We have been discussing the adequacy cf the extra facilities now being made available to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, but these are merely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
Government guarantees on the back of which the AMC then raises money in the markets. We would be remiss in our duty here today if we did not raise the question of the limits set by the capacity of the market itself to produce the money which is forthcoming in the 71½2 per cent. to 100 per cent. ratio on the basis of the Government guarantee.<br><br>
This is against the serious background of the Government's own borrowing requirement. One has fairly precise statistics of the operations of the Government broker in the gilt-edged market, and one has watched with great interest first the relaxations and then the tightenings in terms of local government financing and local government bonds. One is therefore on duty to ask for the Minister of State's views about the limits set to the AMC, not as regards the Government guarantees that appear in subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 2, but the practical limits set by the capacity of the market itself which has been severely restricted by the general activities of the Government themselves in terms of running their enormous deficit unfunded on Exchequer account and being funded in large measure through the market mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can reply to some of the points raised which are basically relevant to Clause 2. As my right hon. Friend said in his opening remarks, the clause simply enables the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to continue to raise money for relending on mortgage to farmers.<br><br>
The Corporation's funds available for lending to farmers are raised by the issue to the public of debenture stock or bonds, and by statute the amount of the debenture stock or bonds outstanding must be backed to a specified proportion by a fund mostly made up of advances from the Exchequer as and when required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used a word which I did not understand. He said that the issue has to be backed "mostly" with funds from the Exechequer. I understood that those funds were entirely from the Exchequer. I think that there has to be 7 1½2 per cent. of the share capital. But it was the word "mostly" which struck a discordant note. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what else besides Exchequer grants make up that 7 1½2 per cent.?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman misheard me. If I may repeat what I said, the Corporation's funds available for lending to farmers are raised by the issue to the public of debenture stock or bonds, and by statute the amount of debenture stocks or bonds outstanding must be backed to a specified proportion by a fund mostly made up of advances from the Exchequer as and when required. To follow up that point, there is a statutory limit to the advances which will soon be reached, and this is the matter we have under discussion today.<br><br>
A survey in 1971, in which the representatives of the Treasury and the Bank of England participated, showed that the AMC's method of raising funds was the most effective, both from the Government's and the farmers' point of view. Since 1928 when it was set up the AMC has become the main source of long-term lending to the agriculture industry, and if it were unable to continue to provide this service there would be a major setback in agricultural development. The greatly increased scale of business in recent years, to which the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) referred earlier, is an indication of how useful the AMC is to the industry.<br><br>
It would be most undesirable to curtail the Corporation's lending, particularly as the direct cost is relatively small. It has been estimated by the Corporation that the demands made upon it could continue at an annual total of between £30 million and £40 million, rising to between £60 million and £75 million in the mid-1980s. To ensure that the Corporation is able to meet these demands over the next four or five years, it is considered desirable to increase the existing statutory limit from £17 million by £13 million to £30 million. In addition, to avoid the need for further main legislation, it seems sensible to make provision for increasing the new limit, with the consent of the Treasury, by an amount not exceeding a total of £10 million by means of an order approved in draft by the House as and when the need arises.<br><br>
Similar advances are made to the guarantee fund of the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation. I know that the position in Scotland and Northern Ireland has not been raised today, but I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
think that the point might be made. The existing limit for such advances is £2 million under Section 63 of the Agriculture Act 1967. The AMC does not operate in Northern Ireland, and in this part of the United Kingdom land purchase is catered for largely by the banks. However, the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland operates a scheme of loans for farm amalgamations and for the purchase of machinery, livestock, seeds, fertilisers and the erection and improvement of buildings.<br><br>
With regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for Westmorland about the provision for losses, I do not think that hon. Members need be unduly concerned about the financial position of the AMC. It is fair to say that the AMC is admirably run—this point was made by several hon. Members opposite—on very sound commercial lines, and that is why it made extra provision for bad debts at a time when land prices were falling. It should also be borne in mind that the majority of its loans are on fixed interest rates and are related by an actuarial formula—to the rates at which the money has been borrowed. Moreover, the loans are made not on full valuation but on a two-thirds valuation. it is true that in the early days, before the AMC built up its reserves, the Government had to come to its rescue. At present I do not foresee that situation occurring again. In the unlikely event that it occurred at some time in the future it would he for the Government of the day to decide what action to take with the consent of Parliament.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Westmorland referred to the figure of £328.000 being set aside for future debts. It is true that this is an exceptionally high figure, but, as the AMC itself has indicated, the price of land now seems to have bottomed out. I think that the hon. Member will agree that the AMC is doing its best to treat with the utmost consideration borrowers who from various causes are or have been in difficulty.<br><br>
The question of why the AMC variable rate has gone up at the same time as the minimum lending rate has gone down is a matter for the AMC, whose directors made their decision before the announcement was made on the revision in the Bank of England's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0083">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
minimum lending rate. The AMC decision to increase its rates for variable loans was based firstly on the outcome of its borrowing and lending for variable rate loans over the past six months, and also on its projection forward for the next six months, and, secondly, on the level of the clearing banks' base rates over the period under review—not, I may add, the minimum lending rate.<br><br>
In short, the AMC has to relate its lending rate to the rate at which it can borrow. The main answer is to reduce inflation. That will help to solve the problems associated with variation in land prices and values and the difficulties of getting financial help. Hon. Members, despite differences in approach to our policy, will recognise that there have been substantial improvements in this matter in recent months.<br><br>
On the question of the interest rates charged, it has been suggested sometimes that they are too high. The rates charged by the AMC for loans are governed by the cost of the funds it has raised on the market by debenture issues and reflect the long-term nature of its borrowing.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
Because the Government's advances to the guarantee fund are interest-free, and are invested in gilt-edged securities, the AMC is able to lend to farmers at rates of about 1½2 per cent. lower than would otherwise he the case. As a result, the AMC rates are fully competitive with those that farmers would have to pay elsewhere for uncallable, long-term finance and enable the Corporation to meet the requirement in the Agricultural Credits Act 1928 that it should lend on terms most favourable to the borrowers.<br><br>
The AMC is a main lending authority for farmers. There are also other sources of credit such as banks. The problem of getting subsidised credit has been put forward already and I should like to say a few words about this.<br><br>
This has been raised because cheap, or subsidised, credit is one of the features of agricultural finance in some of the EEC countries. Indeed, Directive 72/159 of the EEC which deals with the structural reform of agriculture leaves the choice between subsidised credit and capital grants to the individual Member States. Although some give assistance to their farmers mainly in the form of an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
interest rate subsidy, the United Kingdom has retained its capital grants system. The EEC policy is to work towards a more uniform situation between member states.<br><br>
This is a matter for the member countries concerned. But one cannot have it all ways and we are not able, in relation to what happens in this and other countries, to make fair comparisons, because the whole basis of finance for farm structure varies from place to place. At present we believe that the grant system is better than the subsidised credit one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that, although expressly the Minister himself, and now the Minister of State, say that the United Kingdom Government accept the provision of Directive 159/72, this has not been the case in respect of France, Germany and Italy? They do not accept formally the implications of Directive 159/72 and that is deeply disturbing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, it is a matter for each individual country to decide how best to help its farming industry in ways that are not incompatible with the interests of the other member states.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that, if there is a directive, it should not apply to all member countries, that we should not exert ourselves to police it, and that a directive therefore can be ignored at will by any member country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would say that the situation is not as the hon. Member believes and, to refer to what I said earlier, the Directive that deals with the structural reform of agriculture leaves a choice between subsidised credit and capital grants to the individual Member States. That is the situation. The fact is that all countries accept the Directive, and it is within the power and discretion of Member States to decide how best to aid its own agriculture. This must of course depend largely upon the problems that face each country from time to time. All these things are for the Annual Review which is taking place at present and the other negotiations taking place in Brussels.<br><br>
Another difficulty in relation to subsidised credit is to decide the area which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
shall be subsidised and the area which shall not. This is a most difficult aspect of a policy which needs a great deal of consideration.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) raised the question of land drainage grants. We have a variable rate of grants—25 per cent. to 55 per cent.—which is under review at present and we hope to arrange for a flat-rate system to replace it at an early stage. There would be some cost to the Exchequer in doing this and we would have to go into this a little further before we can say much more about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that vital drainage schemes are being held up merely because getting the 55 per cent. grant entails having a certain amount of capital equipment on the farm which, in some cases, is not necessary in order to carry out the drainage scheme? Can the Minister confirm that his Ministry is also dissatisfied with the way in which this is working?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member has any particular problem on this, perhaps it is a matter on which he can give details. I think that I have dealt with the points raised in relation to our debate this morning, but there is one which I would record regarding the position of young farmers.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend said before he left for another engagement, we are certainly aware of the difficulty which some young men have in starting farming on their own. The purposes for which the AMC can borrow and lend money are clearly defined by statute. One would have to see whether any of the suggestions for helping young farmers would be within or outside those purposes.<br><br>
Reference has been made to page 136 of Professor Roger Wilson's report. He makes the point that:
<br><blockquote><p>"…the position is not now as favourable as was formerly the case. For many years, the AMC was able to borrow at rates only about 1¼4 per cent. above the rates on gilt-edged."</p></blockquote>
He goes on to say that, in consequence:
<br><blockquote><p>"…of the difficulties then experienced by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, since—although the latter has no connection with agriculture—these events did cause investors to look more closely at underlying realities and the stocks of the Board were un-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
fortunately for the AMC dealt with in the same market as were AMC stocks. The effect has been that the raising of AMC funds has become more expensive and it has therefore had to charge its borrowers higher rates."</p></blockquote>
This is the point I referred to earlier. Professor Wilson is producing a more up-to-date report for the EEC, and I am sure that some of the observations in his very considerable report of only a few years ago are being updated by other people as well. Certainly the Ministry is keeping the availability of credit, and the financial difficulties facing the industry, under review all the time.<br><br>
We have had a fair debate on "clause stand part". I hope, therefore, that the Committee will agree to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is only one point that I am anxious to come back to. I apologise for having interrupted the Minister so early, but as he read out the section again I think it would be helpful if he could clarify that point. As I understood it, he said that the total amount of capital used by the corporation has to have as a base 71½2 per cent. in the form of loans from Government. This is what the clause is, after all, about. It is to increase the advances from Government to the Corporation so that it can increase the other 921½2 per cent. which it raises on the public market. It was the word "mostly" which I did not understand. He said that the 71½2 per cent. which we are talking about now comes mostly from Treasury loans. I thought all of that section came from the Treasury. The word "mostly" clearly implies that part of it comes from Government sources other than the Treasury. Perhaps the Minister will explain why he used the word mostly, implying that some of it does not come from the Treasury. An explanation will help so that one can understand the backing of the AMC rather better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bishop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity of clarifying this point. The word " mostly " is used because the money which the Government advance to the guaranteed fund is only part of the backing for the debenture issues. The rest is made up of the AMC's capital and its general reserves. The figures are: paid up share capital £1.5 million; reserves £5.3 million, and Government advances to the guarantee fund £14.6 million, making a

total of £21.4 million. I hope that that answer is acceptable to the hon. Member and explains the use of the word "mostly" in relation to the statement.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I deal with these amendments, Mr. Costain, I should like your advice. I think you will agree that virtually all the amendments under Clause 3 are interdependent and interrelated. I think it will be to the advantage of the Committee—I hope you will agree—if we have a fairly general debate in which I am permitted to refer to amendments other than those in the first group, otherwise we could have six fairly long debates.<br><br>
What I should like, if it is to the advantage of the Committee and if you, Mr. Costain, sanction it, is a fairly long debate on this first group of amendments, and shorter debates on the next five groups of amendments. As I said, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
amendments are all interdependent, except for two amendments which are basically probing amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most anxious to meet the convenience of the Committee. On Clause 1 I indicated that if we had wide-ranging debates on the amendments I would use my powers on "clause stand part." If it is convenient to the Committee, I am prepared to carry out the same procedure here. The hon. Minister is, however, moving only one amendment, and we are discussing the others with it. If what is proposed is convenient to the Committee, I agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mr. Costain, that you will allow me to go over the background of the Meat and Livestock Commission—because this is what the clause is all about—and the duties and functions of the Commission, with particular regard to consultation.<br><br>
Under the 1967 Agriculture Act, three committees were established. These were the Production Committee, the Distribution Committee, and the Consumer Committee, and it was the duty of the Commission to consult these bodies on matters concerning them. However, it has long been realised that producers and those engaged in distribution of meat and meat products were sufficiently well-organised within their own sectors to make standing committees superfluous. Furthermore, in practice it was found that members of these committees were heterogenous and, therefore, often asked to consider matters which neither concerned nor interested them.<br><br>
The MLC was established under the 1967 Agriculture Act having the general duty of promoting greater efficiency in the livestock industry and the livestock products industry; but not concerning milk or milk products, or fleece wool, or the production of dairy cattle. Included in these duties are promoting breeding programmes—that is why a later amendment would wish to include veterinary officers in the schedule—progeny testing, registration of herds, aiding co-operatives, and providing advice on marketing.<br><br>
As I believe we all know, the finances of the Meat and Livestock Commission are provided by a general levy on carcases. Added to this are fees for Government agency work. These totalled just over £3 million. Total income was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
£5,612,000. Total expenditure was £5,725,000, leaving a deficit of £113,000. In the supply estimates 1975–76 the MLC will receive £2,605,000 from the Treasury.<br><br>
Although the picture appears extensive, it is claimed by the MLC that its pig progeny testing has saved that industry alone more than the total cost of administering the MLC.<br><br>
I return to Amendment No. 10 which relates particularly to the consumer committee. I refer the Committee to remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) on Second Reading.
<br><blockquote><p>"I have to ask, however, why the Government are not also proposing to wind up the consumer committee. One has heard suggestions that the Government take the view that there are not adequate groups of consumers to consult. The House ought to be told why the consumer committee alone is to be left. None of us on the Opposition side of the House has any desire to harm the position of consumers in these matters, but it is rather surprising, if it is true, that the Ministry says that there are no adequate groups of consumers to consult. I was interested in the Minister's Press hand-out on 20th November, which reads, 'Representatives of the National Consumer Council, the Consumers' Association, the National Federation of Consumer Groups, the Housewife's Trust, the Co-operative Women's Guild, the Co-operative Women's Guild (Scottish Central Council) and officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, met today to discuss food and agricultural production and support policy in connection with the Annual Review of the agricultural industry.'</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>If the Ministry itself believes that there are adequate groups of consumers to consult in these matters, I do not quite understand why those same groups of consumers should not be considered adequate in relation to the Meat and Livestock Commission."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend finished that part of his speech by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"An answer on that matter would be helpful."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, <i>c.</i> 1286.]</p></blockquote>
Regrettably I do not believe that the answer given by the Under-Secretary was particularly helpful. I could quote it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Garvin Strang)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quote it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well. The Parliamentary Secretary, who I am delighted to see here, said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Member for Westmorland asked whether we were keeping the Consumer Committee because the Government felt that there were no consumer organisations which the MLC could consult. There is no question of this."</p></blockquote>
That was one of the more positive answers given by the Parliamentary Secretary in that debate. He went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The MLC takes the view, as do most people who take an interest in these matters, that the Consumers Committee is working well, and if it is working well we should not seek to abolish it."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, <i>c.</i> 1345.]</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that is a full answer to the questions raised by my hon. Friend. It is Opposition's wish to see the abolition of that Committee, together with the Production and Distribution Committees, because we believe that consultation with organisations direct is far more positive than through a statutory committee.<br><br>
The Meat Manufacturers' Association has clearly indicated, in representations, that it has no doubt made to both sides of this Committee, that there seems no good reason to retain one statutory committee. In keeping with the philosophy of consulting direct the organisations representing different interests, the Opposition see no reason why consumers should not be consulted through their appropriate organisations, including, of course, the Consumer Advisory Council which, as we all know, is an umbrella organisation. I think we all feel that there is some suspicion about statutory bodies. It seems to me that far more meaningful consultations can take place if the MLC consults specific organisations direct, and not through a statutory committee.<br><br>
I could make many more comments on this matter, but a number of my colleagues will wish to add their views later in the debate—either today or when we meet again on Thursday—about the retention or abolition of the Consumers Committee. I hope that the Minister will be receptive to our view that there are no constructive and positive reasons why this statutory committee should exist now that the Government have suggested the abolition of the Production and Distribution Committees which were set up in 1967.<br><br>
The National Farmers Union, which also has contacted both sides of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
Committee, in common with other organisations, some of which I have already referred to, in the livestock and meat industry, is broadly in favour of the Bill and of the clause, which is designed, I believe, to improve consultation between the MLCand the industry that it serves.<br><br>
Over the years, as the Minister of State is aware, there has been some dissatisfaction in the industry on this score, and it is hoped that the procedural changes which the Government themselves have put forward, and to which we are now adding bysuggesting the abolition of the Consumers Committee, will improve matters still further. Whether or not an improvementresults, will, however, depend largely upon the approach adopted by the MLC itself towards consultation, and we hope that there will be a new willingness on the part of the Commission to take account of the expressed views of the industry'sorganisations on its pattern of services and, what is more—this is touched on in a later amendment—on itsexpenditure.<br><br>
Though the MLC is a statutory body, responsible through Ministers to Parliament, I repeat that its revenue is derived fromthe meat industry, and its duty is to serve that industry—I emphasise that—and the consumers of meat by theprovision of efficiency-promoting services and the encouragement of desirable reforms. It cannot exist in isolation. Ibelieve, as we are seeing in so many other spheres of life today, and certainly in so many other spheres of Government, that the feelings and the position of industry that is involved within the meat and livestock sector, cannot be ignored.<br><br>
The extent to which the MLC can perform these duties satisfactorily depends, therefore, upon its relationships with theindustry itself. I pay tribute to what the MLC has done since its formation, but I believe that its relationship withcertain sectors of the industry has not been as good as it might have been Trust and co-operation will develop only if theindustry itself feels that the MLC is reflecting its needs and aspirations and serving its purposes. If the MLC does notproperly consult—there are various forms of consultation, as we all know—and if it does not respond to theviews of the industry, the industry will regard it as an expensive encumbrance and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
friction and there will be no progress.<br><br>
Experience over the eight years since the MLC was set up has suggested that consultation has not worked well through the medium of statutory committees. Indeed, whenever any major issue arose between the MLC and the industry it was necessary for the commission to consult directly with representative organisations. By removing the buffer, as the Government have gonesome way to do, of the statutory committees from the MLC, we are trying to go just that little bit further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman completes all this in the depths of research that he has clearly gone, would he tell us the views of all various consumer organisations which he has consulted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman himself will add his piece to this important debate. I have not received anycommunication or representation from him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend must have received submissions from or been in touch with the newly formedScottish Labour Party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to add friction to our deliberations this morning. I am sure that if I trepass into that sphere I shall immediately be ruled out of order. To answer directly the hon. Member for Renfrewshire West (Mr. Buchan), because I am known for my direct comments, my answer is "No". I have dot received any communication. I am convinced that theorganisations to which I referred earlier in my speech will continue to be very happy in dealing direct with the MLC and the Ministry. It seems superfluous and unnecessary to have a committee imposed between a specific organisation, the MLC, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman any evidence to bear out his assertion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not received any comment from that organisation. It would perhaps be impertinent of me to seek theviews of people north of the Border, bearing in mind the develop-

ments that are taking place in that area. I shall be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's views on devolution at a later stage.<br><br>
I am not sure whether you, Mr. Costain, would like me to launch into a further section of my speech at this stage. It isalmost One o'clock. I should be happy to sit down now and recom-
