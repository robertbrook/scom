</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard, Mr. Costain, on the radio this morning that racing in your constituency has been cancelled today. Doubtless similar natural hazards have prevented the attendance of the Minister. I find myself at a complete loss, in moving fairly important, albeit probing, amendments in connection with the future holding of the stake in the British Sugar Corporation at present held by the Sugar Board when I cannot expect an authoritative reply. Before I proceed further, Mr. Costain, I ask for your guidance in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that my hon. Friend the Minister of State is at a Cabinet meeting. The Secretary of State is in Brussels, and it was hoped that the third Minister would be here. Information has now reached me that he is fog-bound. We are, therefore, to rescue a Minister from the Cabinet forthwith. I shall be happy to accommodate the Committee in any way I can. Perhaps we could have a brief adjournment until the Minister arrives. I am in the hands of the Committee and it may be that that would be the best practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that my hon. Friend has arrived. My relief knows no bounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that happy note, with the safe arrival of the Minister of State, I can now deal with the amendments. They are concerned with subsection (2) which at present reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall not dispose of any shares in the British Sugar Corporation transferred to him by the preceding subsection except with the consent of the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are probing amendments. The purpose of Amendment No. 2 is to delete the subsection which would leave us in a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purport of Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 is to switch the emphasis. As the subsection says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall not dispose"</p></blockquote>
it attempts to put the onus on him to dispose of the holding, subject, nevertheless, to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"consent of the Treasury."</p></blockquote>
In these ways we have laid down a useful parameter for discussions of the future holding operation of this stake in the British Sugar Corporation, at present held by the Sugar Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the 1974 accounts of the Sugar Board, this represented one-quarter of the issued and fully paid up ordinary share capital of the British Sugar Corporation. One would like to know something more about the loan capital—the guaranteed debenture stock—of the British Sugar Corporation. It is not comprehended in subsection (2), but as one is talking about the future shareholding, and therefore the whole of the capital structure and operations of the finance of the British Sugar Corporation, it is appropriate to put this point to the Minister, because these are Government guaranteed debenture stocks. Depending upon the holding of this 25 per cent., so might amendments be sought to the debenture trust deed and the procedure under the amortisation accounts, which have been set up in relation to that guaranteed debenture stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know what the Minister may have in mind in terms of the possible disposal of these shares. A strong case can be made for the Ministry of Agriculture continuing to hold them. The Opposition would be most averse to the shareholding being transferred to the National Enterprise Board. The prospect is most alarming. We would, however, look more accommodatingly on the continued holding of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
this equity proportion by the Ministry of Agriculture. Nevertheless, strong arguments can be made for at least a proportion of the equity being offered to various refining and user interests in the sugar trade in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On all these counts, it is entirely appropriate for me to move the amendment, in order to explore fully this important situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more in favour of Amendment No. 3—that the Minister should dispose of the shares. During the past 10 or 15 years, I have never seen why the country should own some 36 per cent. of the shares of the Corporation. It is now a viable, great industry that can stand on its own feet, and there is no need to lock up these shares in Government hands. I believe that refining and other user interests would like the opportunity of buying the shares. I was a member of the negotiating team when a few years ago the refiners—Messrs. Tate and Lyle and others—tried to get a stake in the sugar beet industry, which they had had prior to the setting up of the Sugar Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is now on a sound, prosperous footing, and interest, which for many years has been a fixed sum, is allowed to go according to the profitability of the firm. Now that it is recognised that the industry will provide over 50 per cent. of this country's sugar, I believe that it is an opportune moment for all refining and user interests to have a stake in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The refining industry would welcome the opportunity to obtain shares in the industry. These shares are in effect, locked up. I cannot see the point of our retaining them any longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words on this matter, because I think this debate gives us one of the few opportunities that we get to debate the affairs of the British Sugar Corporation and its relationship with Government. Indeed, the amendments deal precisely with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question I should like to ask the Minister, which is one which perhaps I ought to have been able to find an answer to myself, concerns the wretched business of the annual report and accounts of the Sugar Board. I note that in the 1973 accounts there was in Appendix 3 a statement of accounts of the British Sugar Corporation for the year ended 30th September 1973. I regret that I have been
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
unable to find a comparable set of accounts in the Sugar Board's Report for the year 1974. This is a pity. I do not know the reason for it. I believe that the 1973 accounts were considerably enhanced by having the profit and loss account of the balance sheet of the British Sugar Corporation incorporated in that document, together with notes to the accounts, which do a good deal to make it easier to understand the manifestations of the home sugar industry and the arrangements for dealing with imported sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, there has been a reduction in some of the activities of the Sugar Board 	<i>qua</i> the British Sugar Corporation. However, I think that it is a pity that these accounts are not available, and I suggest to the Minister that, when the 1975 accounts for the Sugar Board are produced, the accounts should be put back into the Board's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the affairs of the British Sugar Corporation is that we have seen through Government action an increasing reliance on the home-grown sugar producing industry over the past year or two. For a long time we were growing about 450,000 acres of beet in this country, which on average produces about 900,000 tons of sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government White Paper " Food from Our Own Resources " shows in paragraph 33, which deals with sugar, that the Government's intention through the Community is to increase our aim to 1.3 million tonnes. The paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this event the United Kingdom would be about 50 per cent. self-sufficient in sugar and about 600,000 acres would be sown to sugar beet. The economic case for more sugar from home production is strong. But an increase above 1.3 million tonnes of sugar would probably require new factory capacity. This would need to be considered during the period under review."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to use this opportunity to tell us what is happening with regard to the way in which sugar is produced at home. We know about the involvement of the Government in the British Sugar Corporation. Two of my hon. Friends have already discussed those relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) had to say about the possibility of the monopoly of the British Sugar Corporation being broken. I am bound to say that I never could see a total justification for that continuing monopoly. I know that some years ago a number of other sugar refiners would have been very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
anxious to have a share in the home-grown sugar industry. I have heard evidence over the last year suggesting that they are perhaps not as keen as they were at one time. But discussions and negotiations have taken place over the past few years with, I believe, both this Government and the previous one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us how he sees this situation. Is it the Government's view that there is no particular objection to breaking the monopoly of the British Sugar Corporation? Would the Government be prepared to talk sensibly to some of the other sugar refiners, with a view to giving them a share in the market of sugar beet grown in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a related, important point here—the marketing division as between Tate and Lyle and the British Sugar Corporation. The country is virtually split up into sectors, and one body cannot enter the other's area. That all derives from the operation of the Sugar Act and exchange of correspondence, I believe, with the former Prime Minister, Mr. Macmillan. One would like to know more about that in the future, given the condition of this shareholding now in the hands of the British Sugar Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to my hon. Friend. If the Minister could help us on that point, it would be very helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are delighted to see the Minister here. We quite understand why he was delayed. I hope that the difficulties through fog and other engagements and so on, which caused a slight delay at the start of our proceedings, will not make it more difficult for him to answer our questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking about the possibility of breaking the monopoly of the British Sugar Corporation. I believe that there are areas where considerable numbers of farmers would be prepared to start growing sugar beet. I think particularly of the area around the Mersey. There is a fairly large acreage in Lancashire, with a highly productive arable belt, and in Cheshire and, perhaps, further towards Shropshire, where it would not be impossible to think in terms of a new factory capacity, maybe in the hands of a firm other than the British Sugar Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are great difficulties. I know, too, that discussions have taken
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
place on this matter. The Government have a large share in the British Sugar Corporation, which has the whole of the sugar producing capacity of our country and produces half of our needs. I notice from the White Paper, " Food from Our Own Resources," that the door appears to be open to increase our capacity to produce sugar by over 50 per cent. The last sentence of paragraph 33 clearly implies that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first apologise for the absence of my right hon. Friend the Minister, who is in Brussels on EEC business, and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, who has been held up by fog while travelling by air. For this reason I had to deputise for him at a meeting immediately before this meeting. I hope that the Committee will understand the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of items going a little wide of the amendments have been raised, but they may be relevant in so far as they affect other aspects of the sugar industry and its reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with Amendment No. 2, moved by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). It should be borne in mind that, in addition to the shares which the Board has held till now, and which are now proposed to be transferred to my right hon Friend, the Treasury has for many years had a significant shareholding. In order that there may be co-ordination between the Ministry and the Treasury in the handling of their respective holdings, it is appropriate that the disposal of the Ministry holdings should be subject to Treasury consent. The Treasury has also had the right of veto in respect of these shares, and that should be borne in mind. They were originally allotted to the Board on condition that it did not seek to dispose of them without prior agreement of the Minister of Agriculture, given with the consent of the Treasury. It is proper practice to make such an arrangement a legislative requirement and, therefore, subsection (2) should continue to stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal now with Amendments Nos. 3 and 4. My right hon. Friend does not intend disposing of these shares, either at present of in the future. I think that answers the point raised by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend. The transfer of this holding from the Board to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
the Minister will not alter in any way the Government's relationship with the Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government already have the power to appoint the Corporation's chairman and two directors, and obviously have an interest in the wellbeing of the Corporation. We shall continue to support the aim of modernisation and expansion announced by the Corporation in June of this year, which is consistent with the target for expansion of the United Kingdom sugar beet output set out in the White Paper "Food from Our Own Resources," to which the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland and his hon. Friend raised the subject of reorganisation. Here, the Government have of course, a vital interest in the reorganisation of the sugar refining industry and are awaiting proposals from the two cane refiners. Although I am unable to comment on the details of the proposals now, I can at least say that proposals are expected shortly and we will have to consult fully with all concerned, including representatives of the work force, before we can make any comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take it, in answer to my question, that the Government's mind is not closed to extending the handling of United Kingdom grown beet and the contracting for growing United Kingdom grown beet beyond the Sugar Corporation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to answer that without advice. I think that the point made in our White Paper is relevant and, of course, with reorganisation of the industry and the talks going on with the two largest refiners at present, the hon. Gentleman's point can be borne in mind. However, I should not like to say that that would necessarily be part of the reorganisation programme. With regard to the question posed by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister comment further on the port refinery situation? Will the Minister give us an assurance that he would discuss this with the port refinery workers and hear their views before any decision is announced? Secondly, in view of the expansion of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
sugar beet forecast in the White Paper, will the Minister tell us whether the present quotas are to continue, in other words, is employment to continue at the present level within the refineries? Will he give us that reassurance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can assure my hon. Friend and the Committee on that. My hon. Friend is aware of the very close liaison we have had with the refining industry and with the work force. This has been an important factor in obtaining acceptance of the kind of agreements which we have made so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept all these points. But there are other parties who have a vital interest in sugar, For instance, the users of sugar and the consumers of sugar, if I may differentiate between the two. I have already referred to the sale zones and the parcelling out of the country by the British Sugar Corporation and Tate and Lyle, in a very cosy kind of way. One cannot buy cane sugar in East Anglia. This is required for certain purposes such as the manufacture of mineral water. It is necessary to go to extraordinary lengths and expense. This is quite apart from the operations of the two refineries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know whether the users and consumers of sugar come into these operations, and if so, how? Is this marketing arrangement to continue or does the Minister propose to refer it to the Office of Fair Trading or the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a review of the situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might refer to the Second Reading debate when the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin), who is a director of one of the cane sugar refineries, declared an interest. He said he believed that the Government had accepted that for strategic and other reasons it was necessary to have a mix of cane and beet sugar in our refineries. This is a point on which the Government have not yet taken a view, although they will no doubt consider it in the context of the reorganisation of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can say that no decisions have been taken with regard to the reorganisation of the industry. The two cane refiners Tate and Lyle and Manbré Sugars—are currently discussing a plan which will shortly be put to the Minister. Only when this plan has been evaluated and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
discussed with all concerned can any Government decisions be taken. This Bill will not interfere with these future decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his reply. It is, of course, a question of the continuing supply, and I wonder just how tight is the agreement that has already been reached with the Commonwealth sugar producing countries? Will suppliers of a certain level continue? Perhaps the Minister can give us some indication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were two or three points that the Minister has dealt with and I am grateful to him for the additional information. However, I hope that he will make it clear, not only that consultations will take place with the workers and everybody else interested in the cane sugar refineries, but also with the workers employed within the haulage industry and those who work in the sugar beet factories. They, too, are a highly important part of the sugar industry. I hope that that assurance will be given by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employment of sugar beet farm workers and the men who are employed in the factories has become full time. A total of 90 per cent. of the jobs in the factories is done not by casual workers but by men who are kept on throughout the whole of the year. The sugar beet industry also forms a large part of the haulage industry's income in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to monopolies. It is an extraordinary situation that in some parts of the country Tate and Lyle sugar cannot be bought while in other parts of the country sugar beet sugar cannot be obtained. This seems to be something in which the EEC bodies concerned with monopolies might possibly be interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I appeal to the Government to try to make up their mind as quickly as possible. Since 1970 or very soon afterwards these negotiations within the industry have been continuing. At times, representatives of parts of the industry would not talk with each other, even if they were in the same room. This is an appalling state of affairs. Following the poor crops in the past two years the industry now lacks confidence. I know that the Minister wants to expand the beet growing industry in this country which is of importance to East Anglia. We want to see something settled finally before very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
long. I therefore hope that the Minister can give us an assurance on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given assurances about consultations with all the interests concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new factory capacity is still under review and expansion and modernisation is proceeding. I know, as a result of a recent visit to the Newark factory, that this is one of the five which is being used for expansion of the industry. All this is helpful because it is in the direction of the objectives of the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) concerning the British Sugar Corporation's monopoly of beet, the Community legislation says that a percentage of the processes quoted can be transferred to a new refiner if the Government agree. The Government have an open mind on the matter at present, but any prospective beet refiner would have to demonstrate financial soundness and ability to obtain sufficient beet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the point he raised about market sharing, there was a pre-Community arrangement—which is no longer applicable in the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) regarding ACP quotas and the continuation of supplies, I refer him to the Lomé agreement which gives a long-term guarantee of access.

I think that I have dealt with most questions raised by hon. Members. The amendments are unnecessary. I note that they were tabled as probing amendments and I trust that I have been able to satisfy the movers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has shown considerable good will in answering many of the points raised arising from subsection (2) regarding the future of the shareholding of the British Sugar Corporation. However, there are a number of aspects of the situation that still require clarification. According to the Minister, this will all take time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application of Section 19 of the Sugar Act 1956 and the incentive agreement with the Government no longer applies because of the EEC situation. The British Sugar Corporation is thus now a trading operation without Government incentives. It has Government

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
backing and one would like to think that the whole process of consultation can be considerably speeded up. There seems to be a superfluity, or non-applicability, of Section 19 of the Sugar Act 1956. We cannot continue marking time in this matter. By the time we reach Report Stage we shall seek to press the Government before parting company with this part of the Bill for Third Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that there would be no question of the dumping of these shares and that, whatever their future holding, the shares will be securely retained by the Ministry of Agriculture. Presumably any future destination will be negotiated along the lines we have suggested. That is a very important point because a wide range of the shares in the British Sugar Corporation are held by the public. If it was felt that a large line of shares were overhanging the market, that could have a disastrous effect on the holdings of private individuals, many pension funds and the like. Meanwhile, we view the situation with an open mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not touched on the situation concerning the guaranteed debenture stock, nor has he touched on the wherewithal for the capital development programme of the British Sugar Corporation which, according to the last review by the chairman of that Corporation, was of the order of £10 million. Looking at the interest figures, one has some doubts as to how it is all to be funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I prefer not to pursue these points now. I repeat that the Minister has shown considerable good will in discussing, however superficially, various aspects of the situation in Committee this morning. I simply endeavour to put down a marker, as it were, to retain the right of the Opposition to return to this question in a more finite sense on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what has transpired, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 22, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which will be subject to affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, the moving of which will not take place prior to the discharge of the Minister's duties as specified in subsection (5) above".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
The amendment is to be added to the words of subsection (6), which are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any power to make an order conferred on the Minister by this section shall be exercisable by statutory instrument."</p></blockquote>
Then I am proposing, with my colleagues, to add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which will be subject to affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, the moving of which will not take place prior to the discharge of the Minister's duties as specified in subsection (5) above."</p></blockquote>
Subsection (5) refers to the laying of the report—that is, the report and accounts—of the Sugar Board, as at the Appointed Day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument as to the Appointed Day and the ability of the Minister to lay the report and accounts could become highly circuitous, and could be a chicken-and-egg situation, but I put it to the Government that it need not be so. There is no reason why the Sugar Board cannot be left in embryonic form, non-trading, and the Appointed Day pushed along until the Board has tied up all its accounts and submitted them to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Embraced in the final report and accounts of the Sugar Board will be all the consumer sugar subsidy operations which are reflected in the Supplementary Estimates. It is extremely difficult for a back bencher, or for anyone in Opposition, to relate the 1974 accounts to the current situation in the Sugar Board and the subsidy situation for which, as I say, the Sugar Board was made the vehicle. This is a matter of considerable substance, both financially and politically. I should like to think that we will have an assurance from the Minister that either he will think again, as a result of Amendment No. 5, about the implications of subsection (4) and his interpretation of that. I repeat that there is no reason why the Appointed Day cannot be pushed along and the Sugar Board become merely a shell operation, non-trading, until such time as with what remains of the Board the Minister is in a position to present the Board's accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Management accounts must be kept within the Sugar Board, and the Treasury must have its sight of these to authorise, to produce the cheques or whatever, that lie behind the Supplementary Estimates. What we have here in terms of the printed accounts are very old and very incomplete, albeit that we now have the accounts to December 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise, we on this side of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
Committee are most insistent on seeing that the accounts be laid before Parliament before we put the Sugar Board to bed finally. This can be achieved quite simply by the Minister agreeing to operate subsection (4) in the spirit of the amendment that we now have tabled as Amendment No. 5, so that the appointed day will not put the House in this chicken-andegg situation. The duty of laying the accounts will be performed before the appointed day, and to achieve that end the Sugar Board carries on in embryonic, non-trading form if there is considerable delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot achieve that, Opposition would settle for circulation between now and Report stage of draft—and these can be heavily underlined—but updated accounts of the Sugar Board. These accounts must be available at the Treasury. The Government cannot have advanced the figures to which my hon. Friend referred under the Supplementary Estimates, and which run into hundreds of millions of pounds, without having seen something from the Sugar Board. As a compromise, we would settle for draft figures and a reconciliation of those figures from the Sugar Board with the movements within the Supplementary Estimates. If the Minister could, alternatively, agree to circulate those kind of figures perhaps we could agree not to pursue, either in letter or in spirit, the whole content of the amendment as it appears on the Order Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down—having completed my task of wooing this amendment—I refer to the affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament which are called for in this amendment. The object behind this is quite clear, and too much comment from me would be superfluous. Quite simply—and I say crudely, Mr. Costainthe Opposition are not prepared to let the Sugar Board disappear like a ship in the night. We want to settle this situation through affirmative resolutions in the House. While I go some way to praise the Sugar Board, certainly in terms of the dedication of its personnel, as a large sugar importer, dealer and user, I have always previously had severe criticisms to make of the concept of the 1956 Sugar Act, its operation, and of the Board. I do not challenge its integrity. Our consumption is a tiny fraction of the amount of sugar consumed in the world, varying between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent. Why
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
we ever had to expose our domestic sugar price to such highly artificial, marginal variations in the supposed world price I shall never know. Lots of other mechanisms could have been devised as an alternative to the 1956 Act to accommodate the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and the British sugar beet producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said for the Sugar Board. Hence we seek the procedure of an affirmative resolution which will also enable the House as a whole to comment on this vast sugar subsidy operation for which the Sugar Board has been made the vehicle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government will be able to accept this amendment because it is a once-and-for-all matter. We do not ask that it should be laid before the House in an affirmative form once a year, as some other matters are. It will happen only once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that when the time comes for this order to be laid before the House on an affirmative resolution, the Opposition of the day will not feel inclined to oppose the order, or may be prepared to give it to the Government "on the nod".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister will agree that this latter period in the Sugar Board's life has been a traumatic one. If the Minister wants evidence of this I invite him to look at the top of page 10 of the 1974 accounts of the Sugar Board where sums which have been put down for the last three years under the heading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Transactions in Commonwealth Sugar, Surplus for the period".</p></blockquote>
For this year we see a sum of £309 million. Last year, it was only £62 million—though that was for 11 months—and for the 13 months prior to that, up to 31st January 1973, the figure was only £1.2 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That illustrates why the Opposition regard this period in the life of the Sugar Board as especially important. We are giving the Minister powers in the Bill today which are something of a shot in the dark, because we do not have available to us the figures to the end of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will realise that what we are asking for is a " safety net " procedure, so that these affairs can be debated on the Floor of the House at some future time, if the Opposition of the day felt inclined to raise the matter. It is not a continuing requirement. While I well
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
understand—having spent part of my life involved in the "usual channels"—that Governments do not like giving themselves Committees and having to put matters on the Floor of House if that can be avoided, this is a unique and worthy situation which the amendment admirably covers. I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend hon. Members for the clarity with which they have expressed their comments. I hope that I can equally clearly satisfy them on the procedure and on the fact that the matters about which they express concern will be taken care of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been in a difficult situation during the past year, as hon. Members know, with the change-over from the pre-EEC régime to the EEC régime. As the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) pointed out, there have been problems in the accounts. If he refers to the Sugar Board's sixteenth report, he will see a note of explanation showing that the presentation of the 1973 accounts was held up because of the problems concerning refiners' transitional stocks. This was not settled in principle until April 1974 by an EEC Commission regulation and the consequential detailed arrangements were not settled until some time later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The note goes on to explain various aspects of the financial situation affecting the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explain to the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) that, despite his suggestions, the amendment is not workable. The effect would be to delay setting the appointed day until the Board's final report has been laid before Parliament. The Board's final report will cover the period ending, not on 31st December, but on the day immediately preceding the appointed day, so that the report and accounts cannot be completed until the appointed day has been determined by order, and, of course, even if the Board is non-trading, the auditors will not sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the impracticability of the amendment, it is not appropriate to apply the affirmative resolution procedure to the orders in question. Orders are normally subject to the affirmative resolution procedure only if they empower new Exchequer expenditure or elaborate and significant details of ministerial powers which Parliament had previously ap-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
proved only in principle in the parent Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders under the clause will not authorise any new Exchequer expenditure. They will only apply a date to decisions of principle to be taken by Parliament during the passage of this Bill. There is therefore no justification for taking up parliamentary time on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Officials of the Ministry are in touch with the Board on the practical arrangements for dissolving it. Detailed plans will depend on the progress of the Bill through Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appointed day is the day when assets and liabilities are vested in the Minister. The Board will not be dissolved until a final report and accounts have been submitted to Parliament. After 1975 no further Commonwealth sugar payments will be shown in the Board's report. Reports will only reflect administrative expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Board will not be dissolved until the final report and accounts have been submitted to Parliament answers the hon. Gentleman's request that Parliament should know what is being done. In any case, the passage of the Bill anticipates the ending of the Sugar Board. The Committee and, I hope, the House will take the decision on this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the assurances I have given, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sparking on all cylinders. I do not understand what the Minister said. He said that the Board would not be dissolved before the accounts had been laid before the House. It has previously been asserted that on the appointed day, it being the date of dissolution, we could not have the accounts because they could not be audited on that day. I am very confused. Perhaps I am being dense. I hope that we can find the mechanics for meeting the kind of point that I have been making with considerable seriousness. I reserve my position with regard to the affirmative resolution. Perhaps I can comment on that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I probably overlooked a point about the timetable which might reassure the hon. Gentleman. The intended timetable is first to transfer the Board's liabilities and assets to the Minister on the day appointed by order, and then to prepare the report and accounts for the final accounting period of the Board,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
which ends on the day before the appointed day. Finally, when the report is complete and final accounts have been audited, the report will be laid before Parliament and the order made to dissolve the Board. I hope that that clarifies the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does no more than to confirm my understanding of subsection (4), which did not take long to interpret. I pulled the guts of it apart, separated it under my own headings (a), (b), (c) and (d), and understood it. It is precisely what the Minister said. It leaves the loophole that the whole matter will be over, in as much as the Sugar Board will have transferred its assets before the House has a chance to see, let alone debate, the accounts of the Sugar Board. I am deeply concerned about this matter. The furthest that the Opposition can go is entirely to reserve our position pending Report Stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) may feel justification, whatever the inadequacies of the amendment, to press it to a Division to register our position. I accept the logic of the Minister's explanation of subsection (4), but that does not meet the point with which I am grappling. The whole matter is an enormous tautology. It is entirely circuitous. The possible intervention by the House in this matter is extraordinarily nebulous, and would appear to be very much 	<i>ex post facto</i> on a literal interpretation of subsections (4), (5) and (6) taken together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister defends the non-use of the affirmative resolution on the grounds that affirmative resolutions are very rare birds and apply to matters of great monetary consequence, or other legislature of similar importance. I cannot accept that. The mechanism of an affirmative resolution is to protect the House and the voters. It is entirely up to the discretion of Members whether to seek the safeguards of an affirmative resolution. We on this side seek so to do, in order to protect the House and our electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept that the process imposes a waiting period which has hilarious consequences in terms of procedure under subsection (4). Somebody will have to work that out, which is why we hire all the bureaucracy that we have. I do not believe the answer to be beyond the wit of man, and I would not mind applying myself to the job. I have just raised the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
corner of the carpet, as it were, in order to precipitate thinking about the whole of this important question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot let the Minister get away with this. I would like to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland whether he thinks we should press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) has clearly explained the Opposition's attitude. I hope that the Minister has understood the point that my hon. Friend has been trying to drive home. I understand the difficulty over laying affirmative orders, exactly as laid down in the amendment, at the earliest stages of the dissolution of the Board. But we are saying that before the Board disappears an affirmative resolution should be laid before the House, so that we may say a final "Good Afternoon" to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he is opposed to using the affirmative procedure, except in accordance with certain principles. I think he said that normally it is used only when new expenditure is involved or the Government have been given powers in principle and are seeking to explain them in greater detail. I notice that there is down for debate under the affirmative procedure later this week the Weights and Measures Act 1963 (Biscuits and Shortbread) Order 1975. I do not know how that comes within the parameters of the rules which the Minister suggested a few moments ago. I do not think that it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I think that the order which we are considering comes within the rules which the Minister suggested because, under the clause, we are giving the Minister powers in principle. It is not right that we should have the right to debate only once the details of what is implied in the principles laid down here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be prepared to reconsider the matter with a view to putting down a considered amendment on Report. That would be helpful. If he is not prepared to meet the points that we have raised, we may well have to challenge him with a vote. I do not particularly want to do that, but we have a fair point here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having said, I believe rightly, that the amendment is administratively impractical, I should find it difficult to say that it can be accepted. I can well understand the Opposition's concern, in

wanting to know the situation before any action is taken. But the Committee is now debating the procedure for the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister kindly apply his mind to how a limited liability company goes into members' or voluntary liquidation, how that can be achieved by an extraordinary meeting of shareholders with the accounts presented, and why he cannot do something parallel in these circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I go back over some of the points that I made about the affirmative resolution procedure.

The amendment seeks to add an additional subsection. There is a certain elegance about its words, as they come</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
	<p>As I have made quite clear, the orders under the clause will not authorise any new Exchequer expenditure. They will only apply a date to decisions of principle to be taken by Parliament in the passage of the Bill. Therefore, there is no justification for the amendment.</p>
	<p>The timetable which I have indicated to the hon. Member is sufficient assurance of the interests of Parliament being protected. It is, first, to transfer the Board's assets and liabilities to the Minister on the day appointed by order, and, secondly to prepare the report and accounts for the final accounting period of the Board, which ends on the day before the appointed day. Finally, when the report is complete and the final accounts have been audited, the report will be laid before Parliament. Only then will the order be made to dissolve the Board. Therefore, there is a report back to Parliament in a way which protects the natural concern of the House in the winding up of the Sugar Board.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>The 	<i>Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 6.</p>
	<p>largely from the pen of a former distinguished parliamentary draftsman. They pick up a theme which appears in subsections (3) and (6) of Section 1 of the Sugar Act 1956.</p>
	<p>It was understandable that the Minister should consult in terms of some of the arbitrary powers in that Act. He could well plead that, given the EEC arrangements, it is superfluous and irrelevant for the Opposition to endeavour to insert this consultation procedure. But I commend the amendment on the ground that although it is not obligatory it would give specified parties—their number can be enlarged and amended if the Minister does not like the references I have made something to point to in terms of access to the Minister in normal circumstances,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
even within the ambit of the EEC operations. I do not see what is wrong or offensive in that.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, there is always the possibility that the Minister, with or without the approval of the Council of Ministers of the EEC, might find it desirable and necessary to go elsewhere in the world to make a deal for sugar for consumption in this country. I challenge the Minister to put his hand on his heart and say that that can be written off as absolutely impossible within the next decade. It cannot. In those circumstances the parties mentioned in the amendment should certainly have something to be able to point to in terms of access to the Minister. However, perhaps that is over-dramatising the situation. I merely seek, with my hon. Friends, to pick up some of the echoes of discretionary consultation on the part of the Minister as laid down in the 1956 Act.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) in this matter. I know that consultation takes place and that it has many meanings in different spheres. Sometimes consultation merely means letting a chap know what one is intending to do, and then doing it the next minute. I hope that that sort of consultation never takes place between the Ministry of Agriculture and interested parties. Nevertheless, it is good to have this kind of clause written in the Bill to remind the Ministry—whatever Government is in power—of its responsibilities. It would certainly be good if refiners and other trade interests could point to such a clause in the legislation and say that they have a right to consultation on matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I draw to the attention of Members who represent refining areas the fact that I believe that over the next decade—and one must look at it over this time scale—we will find that the exporting cane countries will want, and will be forced into, far greater mechanisation for the purpose of cutting and harvesting their crops. At present, it is very labour-intensive. But the average age of the workers in the sugar industry is high. From my visit to Mauritius I know that the exporters are worried about this problem. They could go over to mechanisation almost at once, but for the fear of putting this older population out of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
There will come a time, however, because the younger generation is not taking to this type of work, when mechanisation must take place. This leads me to say that refining will probably have to take place within those countries. In seeking other outlets for the labour dispossessed from the fields, the exporters will think of setting up refineries within those countries. Therefore, refining will not take place in this country as it has traditionally done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This gives point to what I have previously said about allowing refiners and other users to take an interest in the sugar beet industry in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, constant consultations should take place as the Government and importers learn of trends in those cane growing areas. There must be the closest possible consultation, almost continuously, between the Government, importers and refiners so that we are not suddenly faced with a great deal of unemployment caused by a sudden cutting off of the supply of sugar to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever agreements are made, can we deny those countries a better price if they can find it elsewhere? Agreements have been known to have come to an end rather abruptly. I urge the Minister, therefore, to accept this amendment which merely puts into words what he says is always happening, but would, nevertheless, be a good reminder to future Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is only one other point that I wish to raise in support of this amendment. We are all concerned, as the previous speeches have shown, and a little alarmed as to what advice will be given to future Governments, in place of that given to the Government by various organisations suggested in this amendment, and also by the Sugar Board itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with sugar we are dealing with such massive sums of money that often it is beyond the capacity of any individual firm or group of firms to furnish the huge sums of money required for dealing with it—certainly at the prices that sugar reached in the last year or two. Therefore, as the Government are inextricably involved with sugar, and often with the financing of it—although I know that things have changed with our accession to the European Community—we are anxious to know where the advice to the Government will come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sugar trading is one of the most fiendishly complicated commodities with which one can deal. It is important to know who will advise the Government when it becomes involved in these matters, and what will happen. Looking at Section 3 of the Sugar Act 1956, which is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Further provisions as to functions of the Sugar Board"</p></blockquote>
I notice that that section begins by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Sugar Board to give advice to the Minister on any matters relating to sugar which he may refer to them for that purpose, including matters arising in the performance of any functions of the Minister under this Act:"</p></blockquote>
It may well continue to be a fact that the Minister will have functions to perform under the Sugar Act 1956. It has always been the duty of the Sugar Board to give advice to the Minister, presumably if it thinks that he may be treading steps which might be dangerous. I am anxious to know where that advice will come from in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sugar Board has held the ring as an impartial agent, giving advice to the Government about the trading of sugar. I do not suggest for one moment that advice given to the Minister by individual trading firms is biased or slanted in the interests of those firms. It is no bad thing that Governments should have a body somewhere able to advise the Minister on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister be kind enough to tell us where he will consult, how he will consult and whether, for instance, he intends to set up an advisory board to give him the sort of advice which is suggested in Section 3 of the Sugar Act 1956? It would be helpful if we could see how the Government intend to proceed in the absence of the Sugar Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief, but I have been stimulated to speak by the last two contributions from my hon. Friends. In the First Sitting of this Committee we had a wide-ranging debate on sugar and while the Minister was relatively forthcoming on a number of points, I do not believe that he gave all the information that this Committee requires. It is appropriate, therefore, that I should raise a couple of the matters that were mentioned then, and again during debate on this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) asked whether
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
the Minister intends to set up an advisory board. It is extraordinary that they should abolish the Sugar Board only to replace it by another board. There are, of course, always complications attached to redundancy, passing one person from one department to another department, and all the rigmarole that goes with the setting up of various boards. It is obviously important that the Minister should be properly briefed on the supplies of sugar because the consumer will be interested in this. The point I raise refers to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). If our traditional sugar suppliers are to set up refining industries in their own country what will be the attitude of the Government of the United Kingdom? What will be the attitude of the European Economic Community? If sugar suppliers set up their own mechanised refining industries, it will have a substantial effect upon employment in this country and inevitably will influence policies followed by this country and the EEC in dealing with supplies of sugar from the old Commonwealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will pay some attention to these points in replying to the amendment. I believe they are important. Not only will the sugar industry—particularly that part engaged in refining—be carefully watching the deliberations of this Committee, but the consumers will be interested to know what is the Government's attitude and how they will be briefed on future sugar policy. Will the Minister direct his remarks to these matters in summing up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reinforce the plea made by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) for the Minister to reply to this matter with utmost frankness?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have been described as being in the sugar lobby—I am never certain what that phrase means, particularly when one represents a sugar beet area—are well aware that the Ministry has consulted generously with everyone concerning sugar in recent years. That has gone on during the lifetime of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. I should like to pay my own small tribute to the way in which the Ministry has consulted with everyone concerned. It has been more than helpful and as the years have passed, there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
has been complete confidence among all concerned in the sugar industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are now moving into a period of some doubt in the sugar industry. One of the reasons for doubt has been expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), namely, that we may have some Commonwealth sugar producers going over to refining. I do not go as far as he does. I know that he has been to Mauritius and has heard what the sugar producers there may do, but I doubt whether many other Commonwealth countries have the inclination to go over to refining. Nor can one generalise about all the Commonwealth cane producers. What may be good for one is a very different matter for another. However, that illustrates the importance of consultations in future. I hope that the Minister will tell us exactly what kind of consultations will take place and with whom. It is important that the consultations should take place in good time before the decisions are known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the wretched things about the sugar industry is that it is mucked about by Governments, which means that wrong decisions are made and prices go berserk—as they always do if the Government interfere—except in the context of a commodity agreement such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. Therefore, if there is to be any likelihood of an agreement, as stated in Amendment No. 6:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purchase of sugar or the regulation of its price to the parties specified."</p></blockquote>
in any treaty or contractual obligation, it is absolutely essential that the sugar industry and all who participate in it, should have full information about what the Government propose long before the decision is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what the Minister must know—he has heard it said so often—that the cane sugar industry demands long-term planning. Seven years is the minimum, as he knows, and sugar beet needs almost as long because it is futile for the Government to say, " We shall allow producers to have more sugar beet and larger quotas this year " unless there is the factory capacity available. We know that our factories work extremely well and our sugar-beet campaign has been a long one. Indeed, it is one-third longer than the French campaign. Therefore it is idle to speak of expanding sugar production, either here or abroad, without long-term planning, which means a decision years before the season in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
which one hopes to increase production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I am one of a tiny and insignificant minority, but I regret the way in which Governments have to enter into treaties over trade and buying products on behalf of the public. They always make a mess of it. We have seen it happening over sugar in the past 12 or 18 months and I hope that the Government do not start trying to buy sugar. Let that be done by those whose job it is. We have a tremendous amount of skill in buying sugar in this country—as much as any country in the world. It is tragic that we do not use that skill. Let it be used on behalf of the British people, whether the sugar be grown in our own country or across the sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think hon. Members have shown a natural concern not only with the Bill before us and the narrow amendment we have been discussing, but with the future of the industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I preface my reply by referring briefly to the fact that the Sugar Board was established in 1956 to purchase Commonwealth sugar in fulfilment of the Government's contractual obligations under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and to purchase other Commonwealth sugar at the direction of the Minister, either as principals or as agents of the Minister. We know that over the years a system of surcharges and distribution payments operated by the Board has had the effect of stabilising the internal price of sugar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) regretted the interference of the Government in sugar trading, I think he will recognise—it is not a party point—that the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement has served us well over the years. We have had considerable changes which have been necessary because of our entry into the Common Market and, as a result of our adoption of the EEC's agricultural policy, the function of the Sugar Board is being terminated. We are now discussing ways in which it can be decently interred. It has come to the end of a period of distinguished work in the sugar industry. The Commonwealth Sugar Agreement expired at the end of last year, since when the Board has administered the price equalisation scheme on an 	<i>ad hoc</i> basis. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is saying that all of that was unnecessary in that the mechanism of the market could have taken care of itself. As he and other hon. Members have pointed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
out, the sugar industry is complex. Over the years since 1956, when the Board was set up for a special purpose and when the Sugar Act was found to be necessary, a lot of changes have taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Will the Minister allow me to say that I have always said that the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement was commercially a very good agreement for this country and for sugar producers? It could be justified on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that it is a 	<i>sequitur</i> that the Sugar Act 1956 was necessitated by the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. The situation could have been handled in a variety of ways. This morning I made the point with some pungency that we have exposed the sugar price movements in this country to the wholly artificial world market which accounts for only between 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. of the sugar that is freely dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said a few minutes ago was that the Sugar Board was established in 1956 to purchase Commonwealth sugar in fulfilment of the Government's contractual obligation under the CSA. I do not think anyone doubts that. The amendment may be rather narrow, but it is too late to debate what should or should not have been done in 1956.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Necessary changes have taken place over the years. More changes have been necessary in the past year or two as a result of our entry into the Community, and more will be necessary in the future. We have been through a period of change. This is an interim period during which we are gradually making the necessary changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have referred to the Sugar Act 1956, some of which will be repealed. The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) referred to certain sections—Sections 1 to 5, 6 and 21—which are so far unrepealed. It seems odd that we should want to put bits of an old Act back into the Bill, when the reason for the Act in the first place has now disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know how well the Board has administered the payments to the sugar refiners. The adjustment in the price mechanism has avoided some of the market distortions which would otherwise have occurred. We should not be debating whether the Sugar Act and the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement were necessary.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
That time has passed, and now under our membership of the EEC, the Sugar Board has no future. I do not think that there is any dispute about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge raised the question of sugar coming from ACP countries. I remind him that the sugar provisions of the Lomé agreement are of unlimited duration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) raised the matter of refining overseas. He asked what the Government's attitude was. Refining overseas makes a great demand on scarce capital. There is no information that this is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) asked where we should be seeking advice about the future policies on reorganisation. I believe that my reply to the last amendment indicated that all the interests would be consulted—the refiners, the distributors, the work force, the trade unions and so on. The short answer is that we shall be taking our advice from many quarters, and have been doing so for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Macclesfield gave the answer to the question whether the Sugar Board should be replaced by an advisory board. I wonder whether there is any suggestion about the retention of redundant civil servants for this alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment requires the Minister to consult trade interests about changes to, or the introduction of, any Government treaty or contractual obligation for the purchase of sugar or the regulation of prices. The purpose of the amendment seems to be that trade interests shall be consulted about any modification to an existing EEC treaty or price regulation affecting sugar. I spoke of this just now in a brief resumé of the history of the Sugar Act, the Sugar Board and the CSA. Those three things were all connected, and were consequential to the policy of the various Governments at that time. I am not sure whether there is any difference of opinion about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But one wonders whether one should impose some of the requirements and provisions on consultation which were built into the Sugar Act in relation to the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, which no longer exists. Changes are being made. Therefore, the amendment has no bearing on the proposal to dissolve the Sugar Board, which did not have such a remit under the Sugar Act 1956. This is completely new and outside the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
If hon. Members are seeking an assurance that the interests of traders, manufacturers and others will be borne in mind by the Government when they are considering entering into a contractual obligation concerning sugar, I assure hon. Members that, without the need for amendments, this will be done. Indeed, hon. Members on both sides acknowledge the considerable consultations which have taken place in the immediate past which led to the completion and acceptance of the new agreements with the EEC and with ACP countries. There have been consultations between the refiners, Tate and Lyle and Manbré and Garton, and with the trade unions. I think that the unions and others have appreciated the way in which the Government have kept them informed about the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has not been easy in a situation where confidentiality was required in the negotiations. But my right hon. Friend, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and I, have been very much involved and recognise that this was absolutely necessary to get the kind of co-operation we needed to make the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our normal practice to consult the trade interests as appropriate on matters which concern them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already shown in the recent changes that we have been very much involved in consultation. This consultation will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering how often the Ministers have consultations about world sugar supply with the British Sugar Corporation. What are the relationships between the Minister and the British Sugar Corporation for discussing future world supplies of sugar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what is meant by the question. I can only answer that the relationships are very close. We have had a good history of consultation with the Sugar Board and—if I may presume this on behalf of all the Governments who have been in power since the Sugar Act 1956—there has had to be this consultation. In the discussions on reorganisation there will have to be continued close consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know hon. Members' concern about the future. We have had the difficult task—my right hon. Friend has been involved in this—of the changeover from the ACP, the negotiations with former Commonwealth countries and some still in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
Commonwealth, all of them wanting to safeguard their individual interests. Apart from sugar interests in my constituency and my consuming interest in sugar—with many sugar beet growers in my area and the British Sugar Corporation factory there—I have been in touch with Guyana and other places and know of the concern about sugar there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has had to take into account our moral and other obligations to the Commonwealth countries. That has been shown by the successful negotiations on the ACP agreement. Sugar is coming into the Community, and other members of the Community are naturally concerned that sugar which comes in, or the sugar beet which is grown there, is used in a way which will benefit the sugar industry and its workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said last week that the first point of any sugar policy must be security of supplies and obtaining those supplies in a form which will keep our industry occupied whether from the producers' and distributors' angle or from that of the workforce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister see, particularly in line with the Government's document "Food From Our Own Resources" a greater hectarage or acreage of sugar beet in this country? He has commented this morning, and was fully supported by my hon. Friend and other hon. Members, that there are certain areas of the country where sugar beet can be produced extremely well. It would be helpful if the Minister, while he is on this point, would say whether he sees in future a larger acreage of sugar beet for producers in this country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), has said, it will take time to get all the machinery behind producing sugar beet and the factory capacity to deal with it. Will the Minister indicate whether he foresees a larger acreage? This would be looked upon favourably by sugar beet farmers, and would enable them and the industry to make the necessary investment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered the hon. Gentleman regarding the future of this country's sugar industry. As he will know, our White Paper indicated that we hope to be 50 per cent. self-sufficient in sugar supplies by the 1980s. Indeed, the White Paper suggested that the aim is 100,000 extra acres by 1980, but obviously we must take into account the yield and other factors. That is one of the problems.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
It is not just a matter of having more acreage and growing more sugar. We must combine acreage with yield and there are also other mechanical problems. The British Sugar Corporation has extensions going ahead for five factories, which indicates its plans for increased capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to say in detail at this stage what the future will be up to 1980 and beyond, except to point to the White Paper. As I have stated, discussions are going ahead and I cannot forecast when they will be completed. What is important is that we have reorganised the sugar industry and this will take into account all interests, in addition to the getting of sugar and securing our supplies. I hope that the spirit of my reply, which has been rather fulsome in response to the questions of hon. Members opposite, has assured the mover of the amendment that it is unnecessary, there is the spirit, the record and the intention of the BSC. As the amendment is not particularly concerned with the Sugar Board and may be tied up with an Act which has now been substantially repealed, including the sections to which the hon. Member referred, I hope that the Opposition will accept my assurance and will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a brief intervention? As the Minister knows, I have more urgent, although not more important, matters on my mind at present. I shall try to be brief and I apologise for the fact that I may have to leave the Committee before he replies, but I think he understands the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is partly related to this amendment in relation to consultation and is about the expansion of beet sugar, asmentioned in the White Paper "Food from Our Own Resources". A figure of 1.5 possibilities has been quoted. We are told that we are aiming for 50 per cent. self-sufficiency by the 1980s, which can be weighed against the 1.4 million tonnes of ACPsugar in the Lomé Agreement access. I want to check on that figure of 2.9 or 3 million tonnes in relation to British needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to see it against the background of the EEC, which together has always been a prolific sugar beet producer. That has always been a problem which we faced in Common Market discussions—our presence as a member of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
a single market. Are we saying that the Lomé Agreement guarantees not just right of access—that is, that people may buy 1.4 million tonnes from ACP countries? Does the Agreement also say that that amount will come in? Saying that our buyers, whether national or individual, can buy up to 1.4 million tonnes, and that we will guarantee that our buyers will be able to offer up to that amount, is very different from saying that 1.4 million tonnes will come in. That deals with the point made by the hon. Gentleman about public as opposed to private buying, because with the second no such guarantee can be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are envisaging that kind of expansion, and saying that 1.4 million tonnes will come in if it is available in EEC countries, how does that relate to our presence as members of a single market in which there is also production of sugar beet over and above the point of self-sufficiency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that our EEC partners were concerned about the effect of sugar coming in relation to their own interests. That is quite right. We have joined the Common Market, and that applies also to dairying. Is it conceivable that European sugar producers will say " Despite the fact that you have joined the Market so that, among other things, your market will become available to our producers, you are not letting that happen because you are importing under the Lomé Convention."? I do not see that point being safeguarded so far, and I should like the Minister's comments about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to know where we are placed regarding the pricing situation, which the amendment also mentioned. Looking at page 26 of the White Paper I notice the amazing jump on the graph in the price of sugar. The world price of sugar rose dramatically when I joined the Department last year; it fell equally dramatically exactly at the point at which I left. I am not sure if that is an inverse or a direct relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed on the basis of the intervention price, plus a premium to be negotiated. Unless the 1.4 million tonnes are guaranteed, not just the possibility of access, but of actual access, the premium could be very low if we have our own beet production at that level and there is over-self-sufficiency in Europe. That is a problem facing our past and certainly our moral commitment to the ACP countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
An hon. Member referred to the problem facing the Commonwealth countries. Theirs is not an annual crop, it is a seven-year cycle and it puts us in a very difficult situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the situation I am describing is accurate—if it is not, the Minister will tell me—it immediately puts in jeopardy, unless we receive the correct answers, the question of what will flow from amalgamation in relation to employment in the sugar cane refineries. My own area of Greenock already has high unemployment, which accounts for the urgency of the other problem I am facing in relation to Linwood, because workers from Greenock work in the Chrysler car factory at Linwood. Will all this pose a threat to their employment prospects?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the reasons why the Opposition's amendment should have included reference to the need for consultation with the workers. It should have done, but it does not, although I mean no disrespect to you, Mr. Costain. I hope that no such legislation is laid without the inclusion of reference to consultation with the workers. Indeed, I would go further and say without the agreement of the workers. Therefore, I hope that that will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to see how we square this circle of the promised expansion of sugar beet plus the promised intake of 1.4 million tonnes, to find out if this is a promise, how this will relate to the price they will be facing with premiums to benegotiated over and above, I think, the intervention price at present. Viable as sugar beet production is in this country, I recognise the need for maximum development. I recognise the spin-off also in sugar beet production. Farmers in myconstituency in Scotland have suffered considerably from the loss of the Cupar factory, not only from the sugar aspect, but also from the tops and the pulp for pig pulp, which is extremely valuable. We may have to plan more intelligently. One of my disagreements with the Ministry arose because I believe that one can bring to agriculture an element of forwardplanning—a more intelligent application of planning for alternative production in those areas to maximise that which can be done and that necessary for the nation. One will therefore have to question whether the kind of resources we are putting into this are the right ones or whether the potential should be in the expansion that is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
I realise that I have posed a number of major questions. I should have preferred to wait until we debate Clause stand part but HANSARD makes it clear that you felt that the "Clause stand part" debate could in sections be dealt with in discussion of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise my hon. Friend's concern, particularly as he has a constituency interest in sugar. I wondered about some of his references to squaring the circle. In the context of sugar, I should have thought it was a matter of cubing the circle or circling the cube, whichever is the sweeter interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the Lomé Agreement, which we all welcome whatever our views on the Community. It does, of course, guarantee access, though it does not guarantee supply, and this is one of the factors which my hon. Friend may have had in mind. Despite that, there is a very strong incentive for the ACP countries to supply, in view of the guaranteed price which is negotiated every year. There will be no price incentive for sugar from other EEC countries to come here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the 1.4 million tonnes will be guaranteed because of the level of price negotiated rather than that we will be open to 1.4 million tonnes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with some of the figures mentioned by my hon. Friend. I think he said that only 1.4 million tonnes were offered by ACP. In fact, only 1.3 million tonnes were offered by ACP, not 1.4 million tonnes as he said. The British Sugar Corporation's target is 1.3 million tonnes and not 1.5 million tonnes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I used two figures—1.4 million tonnes and 1.3 million tonnes. One point three million tonnes were available, and the Lomé Agreement figure was 1.4 million tonnes, was it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The total tonnage will be 2.6 million tonnes, which is equal to the historic annual United Kingdom consumption. With regard to my hon. Friend's question on employment, and the amalgamation of cane refiners, this is an important factor which will have to be taken into account in the consultations which are now taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given a strong assurance several times this morning that the views of the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
work force will continue to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the brief but important intervention of my hon. Friend, which we shall note, and with my assurances to hon. Members opposite who have supported this amendment, I hope they will feel that the amendment is unnecessary because the record shows that we have been consulting and will continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) in his concern that the amendment does not refer to workers. We have had assurances from the Minister that he intends to consult all parties, but one point has not been brought out which I wish to refer to, namely, the question of import control, which is very much to the fore these days. We find Ministries very reluctant to impose such control on various items and here we are, in this Ministry, hell-bent on ourselves producing a commodity that we could import, and rightly should import, from countries badly in need of such trade. I cannot let the opportunity pass without expressing this concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not so gear our production as to block out completely this kind of trade, nor go in that direction. I know that on entry into the EEC this was what we could expect, but I hope that in their consultations the Minister and the Ministry will bear in mind not only the possibility of support but the need to maintain support for Commonwealth countries that we have assisted in the past, and will try to get a cohesive Government policy on the whole question of imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have reluctance on the part of Ministers to impose controls where they should be imposed with the Ministry of Agriculture supporting what is virtually a food control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene briefly to ask the Minister, when he replies, to direct his attention to the appendix to which the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) referred in his very pertinent remarks, which to some extent have been followed by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick), about the amount of sugar that can come into this country and exactly what the Government's policy will be about guaranteeing the Commonwealth cane sugar supplying countries with a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
ready access into this country and Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw the Minister's attention to appendix 2 of the Sugar Board's seventeenth—I think—report, because the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West referred to the huge rise in the price of sugar in 1974 and the almost similarly amazing decline in the price of raw sugar during the last 12 months, rising from about £120 a ton at the end of 1973 to £570 a ton towards the end of 1974, and right the way down to £140 to £150 a ton at the end of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us, and repeat if necessary, the amount of sugar made available to us by the cane sugar supplying countries and why the price of sugar rose so dramatically in the late months of 1974? This all has a bearing not only on our relationship with the developing countries which need to supply the developed Western world with their sugar but also the consumers in this country who are tremendously adversely affected by the dramatic rise in sugar. Will the Government be a little more forthcoming on this question, as it is very important. I know that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor feels very strongly on this question, and I myself reflected this issue during the first sitting of the Committee when I talked about our responsibility to the Third World and the old traditional Commonwealth suppliers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) has raised a good point, in that we should be concerned that ACP countries should have some interest in satisfying our future sugar needs. It was, therefore, the basic reason why we wanted the Lomé Agreement which not only included the Commonwealth but other developing countries, too. We sought to safeguard their interests regarding the Community in the widest possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lomé Agreement is concerned with access. With the removal of any barriers, these countries have the chance of competing with others in, one hopes, a fair way for the provision of our supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for our wanting to ensure self-sufficiency as far as possible is not that we want, in any way, to keep out the ACP countries, or the EEC, but because this is tied up with the balance of pay
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
ments. It is also tied up, as was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), and other members who have constituency interests, with concern for employment prospects. All these things are important to our national stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not really a matter of wanting to keep people out so much as to ensure that those who have a natural and moral right to the provision of stocks will have a fair hearing and that, in the main, we can supply our sugar from our own supplies, as envisaged in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comments of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) were relevant in relation to appendix 2. This shows the enormous rise in the price of sugar and is referred to in paragraph 2 of the introduction to the Sugar Board Report, where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The main feature of 1974 was the phenomenal rise in the world market price for sugar."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to quote the price rise from £143 a ton on 1st January—1974, I presume—to a peak of £650 a ton on 21st November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This created problems for the Government, especially in negotiation. One of the difficulties that any Government faces is that people come along and say with hindsight what we ought to have done in a certain situation. During the past year or so, there was a shortage of sugar—although only in the shops—because of the sudden demand for this commodity in anticipation that there would be a shortfall. But there was an enormous demand, which had its effect upon the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 of the Sugar Board Report goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the consequences of the rise in the world price, combined with increasing costs of raw sugar production, was a mounting dissatisfaction among the exporting parties to the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement with the level of the Negotiated Prices under that Agreement."</p></blockquote>
I know that there were various allegations—many of them unfounded—that the Commonwealth was taking advantage of the world sugar situation and was demanding more money. But we did bring about successful negotiations which took into account not only our interests, but the interests of those suppliers. This is now history. We are now having further negotiations regarding the sugar contracts and I hope that they can be brought to a successful conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
wide-ranging debate and I am most grateful to the Minister for the indulgence that he has shown. In general terms, I should like to say how curious it is the way in which conventions and illusions take root. What a good deal the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement has been for this country, though it has had uncertainties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and it has also been a jolly good deal for the Commonwealth producers. It is far too frequently overlooked and forgotten when we speak of aid from this country to the underdeveloped nations. It is a factor which, all too frequently, is left out of such computations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Talking about illusions, the Minister praised the work of the Sugar Board in terms of avoidable minimising of distortions. I know that certain gentlemen in Mark Lane used to sit down with a slide rule and watch the accumulation, or compute the accumulation, of a surplus or a deficit, work out the surcharges and rebate payments, and make vast speculative profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What one had, in effect, throughout the 1950s and a large part of the 1960s was an accumulation of a financial situation within the Sugar Board, which led to wholly predictable results and distortions vastly outstripping what would have been required if one had been following the basic elements of the market as established by the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement plus the domestic supplies available in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have the considerably narrower implications of Amendment No. 6 before us. It is not my endeavour to divide the Committee, Mr. Costain, and I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment. However, in so doing I should like to tell the Minister that I wish to ponder on his remarks. The fact that the Lomé agreement is of unlimited duration cuts no ice with me at all. One merely has to reflect on the distorted situation with the American Sugar Act and the possibilities of a rapprochement between the United States and Cuba, which could lead to a large increase in the cane sugar crop in Cuba. One thinks of the other extreme of a substantial failure, which is certainly always possible. I do not talk in terms of the yield as of last year but, more disastrously, in terms of either Iron Curtain sugar beet, Western European sugar beet or the whole lot. The pendulum could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
swing either way, even within the context of the traditional supply arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I would not rule out the possibility of the Minister finding it both necessary and desirable to go outside the Lomé Agreement, quite apart from the remarks made by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and his colleagues in terms of accommodating the Lomé supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept what the Minister says about the amendment being "quite unnecessary". It may be unnecessary. It is certainly not apparently and decisively unnecessary, which is all that " quite " means. He has told us about the intentions and attitudes of the Ministry in terms of negotiation. That is fine. But we know that his more senior colleague, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, certainly took no pains at all to consult. on the capital transfer tax that was imposed upon the country, which will be an element lying behind a further amendment later in the Bill in relation to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to wait until we reach that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I am sorry if I have erred, Mr. Costain, in even referring to the matter. But we are talking of intentions and attitudes, and these are borne out by specifics. All I am trying to tell the Minister is that, whereas his relationships may be of the highest and most amicable nature at the present time, that does not vouchsafe the future. I do not see that the fact that one in endeavouring to incorporate in this new Bill wording which derives in part from what was going to be part of the old Sugar Act—these sections have been repealed—forms a contradictory situation whatsoever. In fact, one is consolidating an element out of the previous Act in terms of consultation which could be highly salutary in terms of safeguarding the position of these various parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I wish to reply to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West and his colleague the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick), who said that there was no mention of worker participation in this amendment. It was I who drafted the amendment and my intention had been that " representatives of manufacturing users " should be a compre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
hensive expression, including representatives of sale right across the board. But I do not think we need take issue on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ponder this matter further. In the light of all the remarks and the useful debate that we have had, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN, 	<i>being of the opinion that the principle of the Clause and any matters arising thereupon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the Amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question pursuant to Standing Order No. 47 (Debate on Clause standing part) and Standing Order No. 59 (Standing committees (constitution and powers)), That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question agreed to.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>INCREASE IN ADVANCES TO AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORPORATION LTD.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 26, at beginning insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) It shall be a condition precedent to any action by the Minister under this section that the Minister take such steps as may be necessary, and which he is hereby authorised so to do, to enable the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited to implement co-ownership plans and a mutual funded farming bank, the later to provide credit for approved agricultural purposes to farmers in the United Kingdom on terms comparable to those available from similar institutions in other member countries of the European Economic Community."</p></blockquote>
The amendment is in two parts. One part deals with the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and the implementation of co-ownership plans. The other part concerns cheaper credits for farming—by that I also mean horticultural and related interests—in the United Kingdom. I am sure that the second part of the amendment, at least, will commend itself to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) who spoke to some effect on the question of cheaper credits on Second Reading, as did the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) to whom I shall refer in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With your indulgence, Mr. Costain, and I am not trying to absorb the time of the Committee, may I draw the Committee's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
attention to New Clause 2 printed on pages 38 and 39 of the Amendment Paper. I am advised that New Clause 2 would be an alternative way of achieving the change of status in the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to permit co-ownership of the manner in which it is now presented in Amendment No. 7, wherein it is linked with the question of cheap agricultural credits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are confronted today with two sets of comments made by the Under-Secretary on Second Reading. I refer first to his remarks on the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation on 1st December when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I turn next to the question of the ownership proposals which the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation has put before the Government and which are widely known. I think we must be clear that these proposals do not relate to Clause 2. They are intended to offer a means to the owners of agriculttual land to realise part of the capital value of the land for other purposes. The proposals are under consideration by the Ministry, but I am advised that legislation would not be needed to enable the Corporation "—</p></blockquote>
that is, AMC—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to proceed with the proposals in their present form. The question of legislation under the Bill does not, therefore, arise."</p></blockquote>
So be it. I have before me a memorandum prepared by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If it is convenient to the Committee we can discuss New Clause 2 with this amendment. I shall have no objection, and in fact it may help the debate because one seems to run into the other. If the Minister has no objection we can take with the amendment New Clause 2—	<i>Extension of Constitution of Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) The Minister may approve the acquisition of the issued share capital in the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited by a limited liability company having the same directors and shareholders as the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited and with power to create other subsidiary companies for the purposes of agricultural finance in the United Kingdom but so that the capital for such subsidiary companies shall be provided from commercial sources."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that proposal commends itself to the Committee. The new clause arrives in this form purely on drafting grounds. It was initially down as another amendment and would doubtless have been bracketed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was referring to the very different emarks made by the Under-Secretary.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
I repeat those to give proper emphasis to what I say. The Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am advised that legislation would not be needed to enable the Corporation to proceed with the proposals in their present form. The question of legislation under the Bill does not, therefore, arise."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol 901, 	<i>c</i> 1344.]</p></blockquote>
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is to be contrasted with the following advice and observations from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Co-Ownership Plan has the enthusiastic support of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and also the Country Landowners' Association and the National Farmers Union.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>However, before AMC can implement the Plan some rearrangement of its constitutional powers is necessary. At present, the AMC is restricted to the granting of loans on first mortgage, or under the Improvement of Land Acts."</p></blockquote>
We also have the statement made by Mr. Glyn, the chairman of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, in his chairman's review, published in June 1975 for the year ended March 1975. Under a sub-heading "AMC Co-ownership Plan" he refers to the situation—and I presume this is a report to all shareholders and providers of funds to the AMC:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sorry not to be able to report any real progress with our projected Co-Ownership Plan. These proposals have been submitted to Government but have not yet received approval."</p></blockquote>
That is, admittedly, ambiguous. That does not necessarily refer to approval in. legal terms and might merely mean an enthusiastic pat on the head. In a separate document, from which I have just quoted, it is totally clear that the Ministry is enthusiastic about these co-ownership plans but that the AMC strongly asserts that it needs re-arrangement of its constitutional powers to achieve these co-ownership ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will signify that there is no need for me to go into the details of co-ownership as proposed by the AMC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the co-ownership plans and the AMC aspect, but it may be helpful to the Committee if the hon. Member briefly outlines his views on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most certainly. I was anxious not to over-burden the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be useful to spend a few moments on the details of the co-ownership plan, because it illustrates with extraordinary clarity the convolutions that arise in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
ordinary trading and business circles to circumvent or minimise the harshness or inapplicability of Government legislation in parallel spheres. Indeed, the whole thinking behind the AMC's co-ownership plan is to minimise as far as possible the adverse effects of capital gains tax, capital transfer tax plus, one assumes, wealth tax where applicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the mechanism for the operation of the co-ownership plan would be the formation of a unit trust which would attract pension fund investors who are not subject to revenue taxes. They would be gross funds. The trust would purchase up to, say, 49 per cent. of undivided shares in agricultural properties. The property would then be let back to the original farmer-landowner on a full agricultural tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purchase price would reflect this fact and that the Trust would acquire an undivided share only. The normal rules of joint ownership would apply. Mutual pre-emption rights would apply if either partner wished to sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original farmer-landowner would be given an option to re-purchase the Trust's share at the end of, say, the tenth and every succeeding fifth year—giving guaranteed opportunities to revert to full landowner status, having temporarily ceded the position in order to meet a capital transfer tax, or a similar situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Plan is thus designed as a partial sale and leaseback operation which allows a farmer-landowner to retain a majority interest in the ownership of his farm and to raise capital at a much lower annual running cost than the open market rate, given my previous reference to moneys being raised on a unit trust basis from pension funds and other gross funds not subject to revenue taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an extraordinary situation, and I have it in writing before me, which,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… has the enthusiastic support of the Ministry of Agriculture …"</p></blockquote>
Its whole purpose is to deflate, minimise or whatever, the impact of Capital Gains Tax, and presumably Wealth Tax also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to see that at least one tentacle of this Government is endeavouring to curtail the inroads or whatever, of another Government Department.—[An hon. Member: "Why not go back up the tentacle into the body corporate?"]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder how
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
much of this fine ideal actually goes back up the tentacle into the body of the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have before us this morning a representative of the Government and we shall judge this matter by his own posture. We need not discuss much further, if at all, the details of the co-ownership plan. They are sketchy, but I think I have given an outline that is sufficient to let members of the Committee know what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the essence of the matter, which is whether the AMC has the constitutional powers at present to proceed along these lines. The corporation asserts with the utmost force and clarity that it has not. This is in the face of contrary advice given to the House by the Parliamentary Secretary. Who is right and who is wrong? We on this side of the Committee, and indeed in the Committee as a whole, are prepared to accept the situation at best in good faith, but we want it spelt out, and spelt out with real clarity or we will have no option but to press either this amendment and/or the new clause to a Division with severity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the other leg of the amendment. I take it that we are not moving the new clause as of now, but are merely discussing it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. Can you give us some guidance on this, point because the two matters that we are discussing are separate. When do you envisage that we will actually deal with new Clause 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention I had, which I hope helps the Committee, was that we can discuss the two together because we would not vote on new Clause 2 until we reached the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The virtue of new Clause 2, as I said earlier, is that it deals with the AMC's situation on its own merit whereas Amendment No. 7 merges the AMC situation with the question of cheaper credit for the farming and horticultural communities in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Durham and for Sheffield, Brightside were two of the various Members who spoke with some effect on this matter on Second Reading. They were repulsed by the Parliamentary Secretary who in winding up—this is column 1343—was content to rest his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
argument on the assertion that it would either have subsidised interest rates or a capital grants scheme as now operates in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I have it all wrong, but my understanding is that our capital grants scheme conforms with that operated in the Community. That may be entirely correct, yet one cannot have the two. I do not know. But on the face of things and on the information I have from the Suffolk County NFU, grants to European farmers would not appear to be dissimilar from those available on a capital basis to our own farming operations and, indeed, in many cases are more advantageous. I am talking now expressly about capital grants, not revenue grants covering matters such as the cost of oil which are entirely separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is far from clear that the Parliamentary Secretary is on good grounds in repulsing cheaper farming credit merely on the basis that we operate in this country a capital grants scheme and that that expunges all possibility of moving further towards assisting farming on the financial front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have adequately adumbrated the various aspects of Amendment No. 7 and made useful reference to new Clause 2. I look forward to contributions from hon. Members and from the Minister in dealing with these important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that it will be in order to discuss new Clause 2 with this amendment, but we shall not vote on new Clause 2 at this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clear up this position? It would be helpful if he could say where the AMC stands. Will it require us to make any alterations to its constitution? It seems that there is a conflict of evidence. If it were possible for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
the Minister to clear that up now it might be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pre-empt the Minister's position, but I am under the firm impression that the AMC can lend on first mortgage and that is the only kind of lending it can do. I do not know whether that answers my hon. Friend's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the few minutes that remain I should like to support wholeheartedly the points that have been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) on new Clause 2. At this juncture it would be right to confirm the interests which are set out in the Members' Register: I am the owner of agricultural land. I am also a borrower to a modest extent from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a difficult situation, because my eye is on the clock and I feel that in the circumstances it is necessary for me to wish everybody a happy Christmas and sit down and trust that we might resume this matter at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
