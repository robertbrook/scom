	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly this motion would be for the convenience for the Committee, and we are grateful to the Government for moving it. I understand that, although the amendment is starred, it is being taken and that you are prepared, Mr. English, to take subsequent starred amendments to the schedule mentioned in this motion. I hope that is so. We should improve the Bill as much as possible, and it would be convenient if we took the schedule immediately after Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clipton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the view that the other starred amendments should be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my intention to call the starred amendments on a Bill of this kind where there is no controversy.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 11, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you will have gathered from the preliminary remarks, Mr. English, the objective on both sides of the Committee is to improve the Bill as much as possible.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
There is little partisan controversy on it between the two sides of the Committee, and there may be comparatively little of political controversy. On the other hand, contrary to initial expectations, quite a lot of it may be highly controversial in its technical aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remarked on Second Reading that, given the pace of reform in this area, it was rather surprising that we had got away from the concept of the debtors' prison. Certainly a number of committees have considered the law of bankruptcy and insolvency over the years, but successive Governments have not seen fit to legislate on this matter. So we now have before us a Bill which makes a number of changes, which we shall consider in detail on the specific amendments which we have tabled and in the debate on "clause stand part" at each stage. I hope that we shall manage to achieve considerable changes in the Bill. I understand that the Government have now had consultations with a number of expert bodies on the subject, and we shall look forward to hearing the Government's conclusions on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Amendment No. 1, which seeks to leave out subsection (2), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations increase or further increase any of the sums specified in the provisions amended by subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
The main reason for tabling the amendment is that we feel that it is important that executive discretion should not be unfettered in making changes in these limits. There are a number of aspects of insolvency law where I understand changes can be made by bodies in no way accountable in their decisions to Parliament. If these sums can be altered by order, that is probably undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall listen with interest to the Under-Secretary's reply to the points which we shall raise. There are subsidiary amendments on the Notice Paper at a later stage concerned with the form of any change made by statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question we have to consider is whether it is right that the Government should have power to make amendment by order in any case. We all know very well the difficulties of parliamentary time which are arising now and have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
arisen for some time. The chance of the House adequately debating changes made by statutory instrument is now extremely low. None the less, these limits are important, and we shall be debating the specific figures. The question, therefore, is whether it is right and proper that the Government should be able to alter them, probably in practice without any further debate whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures which it is proposed should be amended by statutory instrument cover a variety of different limits, and the arguments which apply to one may not necessarily apply to another. Certainly the main limit, that, for example, of the amount for which one can go bankrupt, is at present£50. It was originally set in 1869, and has not been altered since. Yet we are now asked, in the subsection which is the subject of our amendment, that the Government should in future be able to change it more or less at whim, and at very short notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a little curious that, having left the limit the same since 1869 until the present day—more than 100 years—the Government should feel it necessary to have this power. It is true that the rate of inflation has changed considerably in the last 100 years or so, but it is not only inflation which is involved in this aspect of the question. If that were so, no doubt one could consider, as on Finance Bills and other measures, the possibility of having some form of indexation which would take account of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not simply the effect of inflation, altering the monetary yardstick, which is relevant in this context. In nearly all these limits there is also an important balance to be struck between creditor and debtor. Obviously the balance between the two is radically altered depending on the limit. If the limit were sufficiently high, it would be extremely difficult for those seeking to recover their money to do so. Conversely, if it were very low, that might be unduly onerous on those who were operating in the normal course of business, or ordinary individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, then, both the inflationary aspect and the question of the balance. The question is whether the Government should be able to do this by order. As I say, in practice it is difficult by way
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
of parliamentary debate on the merits of the case. Given that it has not proved necessary to make these changes very often in the past, we at least ought to hear a substantial argument in favour of doing so in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point arising is this. We were under the impression on Second Reading —perhaps the Minister would confirm this—that the Government, having had three Committees, in 1908, in 1924 and in 1957, had finally decided to carry out a long-term review of this subject. If that is so, this is obviously in some sense a holding measure, at any rate so far as the limits are concerned. It also makes significant changes in the present procedures, to which we shall come later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the review is likely to produce a more radical reform of the law on insolvency, it raises the question whether in the interim the Government need this power to alter the limits. It is surely arguable that in these circumstances one would be better not to have this power.To some extent, it is an incentive to the Government to get on with the job of carrying out the long-term review which has been so long delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point I wish to make in opening is that obviously various interests are involved, and the balance is not only between the oreditors and debtors; it is also a question of striking a balance between the so-called insolvency service, and the cost of that service, and the burden which is placed upon it by the number of bankruptcies which take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of the tremendous increase in the number of bankruptcies which has taken place recently. Indeed, some of the longer term surveys also suggest that the trend has been significantly upwards for a considerable time. The danger is that at some stage, perhaps not very far forward, the Government, in seeking understandably to curtain public expenditure, may, as indeed they do in the Bill, feel that the limits should be manipulated—perhaps thatis putting it too emotively but, at any rate, should be altered—in such a way as to limit the service to the resources which are available. On the whole, they are extensive resources and resources which involve a number of people with a considerable degree of expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Again, is this a matter which ought to be done by statutory instrument? The Government have put this change forward in the Bill and quite openly say that the purpose of the Bill is to cut down the burden of administration and reduce public expenditure. We are certainly sympathetic in principle to that aim. None the less, one must also take account of the effect which it is likely to have on the people concerned, whether they are trying to obtain their money or whether they are those who, certainly in the individual case and also in the firm's case, are going through what is inevitably a traumatic experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our main point, therefore, particularly because we understand that there is a long-term review in hand, is that this is a subsection which could reasonably be deleted. If it is, one would not need to concern oneself with the amendments which subsequently appear on the Notice Paper to limit the regulation-making powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that the general amiable spirit which has characterised the Committee so far, although we have not been sitting very long, will prevail and that the Minister will feel able to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Fletcher-Cooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support this amendment strongly. One has only to look at the amendments on the Notice Paper to see the extreme conflicts that there are in the sums proposed. Some of my hon. Friends have put down figures increasing the sums which would be appropriate as of today and in other cases they have put down amendments decreasing those sums, no doubt for very good reasons. So the size of the sums is clearly not of political controversy but of technical controversy of a serious and deep order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been discussing these sums with those judges whose task it is to administer the bankruptcy laws. They take different views not only from those proposed in the Bill but also from the amendments proposed by my hon. Friends. I instance this only to show that these sums should not be as easily altered or amended as the subsection we are discussing suggests. They are of great public importance, and if the Government get their powers
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
under the subsection and come forward with a new schedule, as it were, in a year or two's time, such a schedule is not amendable if it is in the form of an order. It must either be rejected out of hand by the House or accepted; no amendments would be permitted. Our experience shows that these individual sums—not just the whole collection but the individual sums—are matters that the House would wish to examine sum by sum. This is not possible when the alterations are made by order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charges of administration mentioned by my hon. Friend do not seem to be the subject of this power and they are considerable. It is only the sums which constitute the maximum value of the debt and so on. Most of the sums do not appear in Schedule 1. The importance of the charges mounts every day. If the sums are to be capable of change in the easy fashion suggested by the subsection, the charges ought to as well. I may be wrong. This is more a matter of inquiry than of statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of the importance of these charges, if a man is made bankrupt for a debt of£1,000 or debts accumulated to£1,000, it will cost him about£2,500 before he can get out of it. Supposing he is made bankrupt cn a Monday for£1,000, and he is not well advised. He says he has not got£1,000 and is adjudicated bankrupt. If he had cast about, he could have got a second mortgage on his house for that amount and thus avoided bankruptcy. He then finds that by rearranging his affairs he can get out of his bankruptcy, whichis a serious thing to suffer. It will cost him, not only twice the amount of the original debt, but more than twice as much considering the size cf the charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not think it right that there should be a power to alter the debts and sums in the Schedule without the possibility of altering the charges, which are also statutory. Again, this is a matter of balance, not merely between the debtor and the creditor, but between the debtor and the State, which must be carefully considered if one is going to alter the figures in Schedule 1 relating to the debts without also having the power to alter the charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0960">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely following the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument. He says that the size of the charges is not capable of consideration by the House of Commons. These matters are dealt with by fees orders, which are subject to the negative resolution procedure. Therefore, the matter is capable of scrutiny by a Committee of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say it was not capable of scrutiny. I was wondering whether it was capable of scrutiny to the same extent, whether it was the greater extent of statute or the lesser extent of an order, as is proposed. If it is on the same level, and if there is scme sort of undertaking that the charges would also be considered if the increases were made at the same time and perhaps in the same instrument so that the balance might be preserved, that argument fails to the ground. But it would be quite wrong that charges should be put up by one instrument, say, doubled, whereas the debt was increased only by 33* per cent. The discrepancy in a man being able to get his discharge by paying a debt of £1,000 in the instance I have given whereas now he has to pay£2,500, would be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main point is really this. As I said at the beginning, it is quite wrong that these figures, which are quite naturally and without anyone being right or wrong in an absolute sense on any of them a matter of acute debate should be alterable by a statutory instrument which conies in an unamendable form in future. They ought to be amendable. They cannot be amendable if they are in a statutory instrument; the only sanction is the heavy wheels of rejection which no one would want to use because it is probable that the increases should be made. Therefore, it seems that we should not have this no doubt convenient but nevertheless wrong machinery, which removes the power of amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice in the subsection that it is only "increases or further increases" that are to be made by regulations. No one seems to suggest for one moment that the value of money might positively increase and that therefore the debts for which bankruptcy is available might decrease.The Government are to have no power to decrease the figures, even
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
though the value of money increases. Does this mean that the Government have given up hope that the value of money might increase and thus render the power as suitable for decreasing the funds as for increasing them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to the initial observations of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) concerning the approach to the Bill by saying that my mind is not closed to the possibility of improving the Bill. Both the Government and the Opposition are anxious to do that. Having said that, there is room for dispute about the way in which this legislation is likely to be improved. I would endorse the general attitude reflected by the hon. Gentleman.

As regards the question of rendering it necessary, as this amendment would do, to increase the monetary limits only by Act of Parliament, the hand that writ that amendment is exceedingly heavy. Not only that, but it is an entirely unprecedented suggestion. To use the word of the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival), it is revolutionary. That was the word he used on one or two occasions on Second Reading. I refer in this respect to the latest precendent of the Conservative Government in the Companies Bill 1973 where in Clause 97 the Secretary of State has power by regulations made by statutory instrument to increase a variety of monetary limits in relation to winding up a bankruptcy. The hon. Gentleman will have to convince the Committee that there is a strong reason for departing from procedures which were laid down as recently as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not the slightest idea what Clause 97 covers, but I know that we are dealing in this Bill with a very large number of important figures, some of them fixed by statute as long ago as 1874. Right up to this moment the only way in which they could be changed was by statute. We are proposing something very substantial that may well merit the word "revolutionary".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman, the well-known militant from Southport, is adhering to the second leg of the argument which was adduced by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). I would refer him
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
specifically to the clause again. The marginal note, indicating what it is about, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Increase of monetary limits relating to bankruptcy and winding up."</p></blockquote>
This covers a large number of monetary limits, not discernibly different from those which we are contemplating as a matter of principle in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is in difficulty unless he says—as he is entitled to do and as it is not unknown for members of an Opposition when the Government of which they were part is behind them to do—that they were wrong. That is a legitimate argument and I should not complain if the hon. Gentleman made it; but it is a little heavy-handed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the basis upon which one founded a bankruptcy petition—the£50—has not changed for over 100 years. However, the hon. Member for Worthing stated that it was a great pity that successive Governments had not legislated on matters of bankruptcy for many years. That is true. The House of Commons has been a little remiss in not insisting that successive Governments have done so. I do not hide from the Committee that I am disappointed that we are not able to go further than we have in the Bill. However, there has been consideration of this matter. In determining whether this item to which we shall return later is justified in the present day, we have to look at the principles underlying the law of bankruptcy as it stands. No doubt there will be some interesting comments on that. Be that as it may,the House will not be denied the opportunity to scrutinise these provisions any more than it would have done in respect of the Companies Bill of 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to say that there was an important balance to be struck between debtor and creditor. I entirely agree with that. It will be my submission throughout the debates on the clauses and amendments that these balances have been reasonably struck by the Bill, but if it is thought that we have miscalculated the situation I will certainly look at the matter openly and fairly. However, that does not in any way negate my earlier point that we do not need these draconian powers in order to con
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
sider the position with regard to the monetary limits. Indeed, the problems regarding the monetary limits have become accentuated because of the delay in increasing them, because we have had to have an Act of Parliament to do it, and because we were denied the opportunity of doing it through regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then referred quite properly to the long-term review which we are undertaking. He said that this is a holding measure. However, that would not justify our not seeking to do what previous Governments have done throughout in relation to this type of issue, namely, to enable the Government to impose monetary limits by statutory instrument, because we do not know how long the review will take. It is a most complex subject. There are all sorts of ramifications which we have to consider. It would not be right to postpone that power on the grounds argued by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He emphasised that the reason for the Bill was the difficulties which were being experienced by the insolvency service. That is not the main point of the Bill. The main point is that there has been an erosion of the value of monetary limits which is palpably clear. There is a secondary consequence. The burden which has fallen on the insolvency service has been intolerable. We hope that the proposals which we are putting before the Committee will resolve the problem to some extent. They will not resolve it fully but will go a long way towards doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) raised some interesting matters. He seemed to suggest that the multiplicity of amendments on the monetary limits justified the argument that Parliament should scrutinise each of these with enormous care. There is something to be said for that but there could be untold permutations if an Opposition wanted to table enormous numbers of amendments. It would hardly justify the argument. The Opposition in this case have put down, as they are entitled to, a variety of permutations—some up, somedown, and some I am not sure where. We shall listen with care to what they say, but I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0962">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
seriously say that because an Opposition decide to put down amendments in that form it justifies an enactment to change the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that it was not possible to examine individual amounts which are referred to in a statutory instrument. I think that he was really saying that it was not possible to vote on individual amounts. Of course, it is possible to examine individual amounts and that is in fact done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the size of the charges, I am advised that under Section 133 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 the Lord Chancellor may, with the sanction of the Treasury, prescribe a scale of fees in respect of proceedings under the Act. It is provided:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Board of Trade, with the concurrence of the Treasury, shall direct whether any and what remuneration is to be allowed to any officer …".</p></blockquote>
I may have misled the hon. Gentleman in my intervention, and I apologise for that. The fees orders are not actually laid before Parliament, but the Statutory Instruments Committee recently insisted that there should be a 21-day period between publication and their coming into operation. The fees orders are signed by the Lord Chancellor to the Lords Commissioners to the Treasury. My hon. Friend will be delighted to know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that we are talking about different things. I accept the premise that the monetary limits are important. I am not seeking to disguise that. But the remedy that the Opposition are seeking is a heavy-handed one, not justified either in the circumstances or by the precedents which they themselves have established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for passing over his copy of the Companies Bill. Isee that what was put forward in that Bill was a similar proposal. I do not think that it is quite as far-reaching as Clause 1 of this Bill, but I accept that the principle behind it was similar. However, that was never carried into law, those provisions were never discussed in this House, and no decision was taken about them. I can quite understand why they did not come into law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will know that they were discussed on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Second Reading of such a major Bill, I have no doubt that a great many things were referred to. But I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can be saying that becausethe Bill was given a Second Reading the House decided in principle that Clause 19(3) was acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing in this Committee is for the first time discussing whether it is right or not to depart from the necessity which has existed ever since these limits were prescribed of changing them by the normal parliamentary process. We must come to a decision about it. It is an important decision which introduces a substantial change. Because we see all round the Committee that these figures are important to people, the way in which they can be changed is 	<i>ex hypothesi</i> of grave importance. I will not use the word "revolutionary " again, but I am not sure that it is all that far off the mark in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that we must change them now, and the necessity to change them all has arisen from the erosion of money values. All of that is correct, and because there is at the moment a general necessity to change many of them because of the erosion of the value of money rather than because of the considerations that arise in connection with any one of them or in addition to those considerations, that does not seem to be an argument to say that one should change the way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also threw in as a further reason for doing it the fact that the burden falling on the service has been intolerable because of this erosion of values. This is not necessarily the right amendment on which to develop that, but we have tried in this case and will go on trying to give notice in advance of matters that interest us so that when we come to the amendments on which they are particularly relevant there will be no question of anyone saying that nothing has been mentioned about it before. This is one that interests us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been the extra burden falling on the services? To what extent is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
extra burden due, on the one hand, to erosion of values, and, on the other hand, to the removal of other means of enforcing debts? The answers to those questions open up different avenues for consideration. Insofar as the increased burden upon the service has resulted from the diminution in the number of remedies available to debtors, one should not be thinking of relieving that burden upon the service unless one can relieve it whilst at the same time increasing the remedies open to debtors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real point about the amendment is that these figures are of tremendous importance to debtors, creditors and the public—to debtors and creditors for the obvious reason that they are directly affected by them, and to the public because of the effect which these limits have upon the service which must be provided by the State. The question, therefore. must be viewed in this light. Accepting that they are very important to all three bodies concerned, is it sufficient to have them altered by regulation? One can only answer that by looking at the opportunity which the making of regulations gives for consideration. At best it gives one and a half hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But an even bigger disadvantage about the regulations procedure is this. There is no time for reflection on it. The beauty of the statute-making process is that it provides time and opportunity for two things—for full consideration of anything that merits consideration, and for reflection and amendment afterwards. That is what this subsection proposes that we give up. That process is peculiarly suitable for things which are important as those which we are now considering. The alternative which is proposed—the altering of them by regulation—would not give sufficient opportunity for consideration of the matters referred to in the regulations and would remove the opportunity for reflection, second thoughts and amendment during the later stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will reconsider his word " heavy-handed " as I have reconsidered by word "revolutionary", and reconsider, or at least give some indication that he may reconsider, the main point. Is the method which we propose to substitute for the existing method adequate? It is very convenient for Government Departments—I quite
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
accept that—but is it adequate in the public interest? We do not think it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious not to delay the proceedings unduly on this amendment, but I think it is an important one. It is traditional for the Opposition to seek to reduce the scope which the executive has for making changes by order, but I think in this case one needs to weigh up the arguments and the counter-arguments which have been put forward by the Under-Secretary. Perhaps I may say in parenthesis that we are grateful to him for lending us his copy of the 1973 Companies Bill, which we will certainly return. I think I should mention, Mr. English, that these are now extremely scarce. I believe that one or two outside bodies have copies; I understand that there are no copies of the original form in the Vote Office, and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to sell one to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it may be, Mr. English, that we shall run into some troubles not only on this Bill but on the Companies (No. 2) Bill, which we will no doubt debate at a later stage. It seems quite extraordinary. Copies seem to have disappeared off the face of the earth. As the hon. Gentleman suggests, if the Under-Secretary should by any chance go bankrupt he will be able to sell his copy, no doubt at a substantial premium. Perhaps we should consider making available one or two Xerox copies for the use of those serving on committees on companies legislation which is coming forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments which the Under-Secretary has put forward are in some ways rather curious. He says that there are precedents for having this kind of power. Two points arise immediately from this. First, it is absolutely clear from what he himself has said that there is no precedent for legislation in this field. If there were, I have no doubt that the limit would have been increased since 1914 if not since 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He may argue that it is desirable that a change should be possible from time to time—Ishall come to that in a moment—but the precedents are not in his favour. The only precedent he has seen fit to quote from is the Companies Bill of 1973, and, as has been pointed out, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0964">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Bill fell and the provisions to which he referred never reached the statute book. They may have been referred to at Second Reading, but that does not mean that they would not have been amended in Committee or on Report. The Under-Secretary looks surprised, but I can recall a number of occasions on Finance Bills over 10 years—I got away from it two years ago—where it was fell that powers to amend things, by order, particularly monetary and limits, should be curtailed and not accepted in the 'form which was originally put forward by the Government, if at all. I do not, therefore, find either of those precedents very convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second main point is that, even compared with three years ago, the scope which the House has for debating these matters when it is done by statutory instrument has become smaller. Perhaps the Under-Secretary would care to obtain from the Leader of the House—no doubt such information is available—the percentage of statutory instruments, for example as in the Bill, subject to the negative procedure which are debated. Clearly it is not desirable that they should all be debated, but certainly the Opposition, of either party. would like to debate, and vote on, a great many of them, and has no opportunity of doing so simply because there are too many of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that there is an enormous backlog. That also means that the Statutory Instruments Committee has problems in considering these matters. So the idea that we should go on and on in a situation where legislation is increasing and continuing to increase delegated legislation proportionately all the time is one which we ought to be wary of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point, which has already been made, is that the long-term review is being carried out. The Under-Secretary seems to suggest that it will go on for a long time. Of course, the subject is complex, although he has the Companies Bill of 1973 to build on and he has had the benefit of three Committees already on this subject stretching over many years. I should have thought that by now it would be possible for the Department to proceed with reasonable speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I imagine that the review will materialise within, say, two years. Will it really be necessary to do it by order within the next two years? I should have thought that we ought to be able to set limits which would endure at least that long even at present rates of inflation, if necessary by giving it a sufficient amount of headroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a number of other specific amendments, and I do not want to trespass on those nor on some of the more general points referred to in passing, which will probably arise more appropriately on clause stand part. However, one point worth mentioning is that the subsection which the amendment is concerned with provides for regulations to
	<br><blockquote><p>"increase or further increase any of the sums specified".</p></blockquote>
That is fairly unusual. Most of these things come in tranches. Generally speaking, the provisions allow one to make one increase, then another and perhaps a third, but there is normally a restriction of that kind. Yet this subsection asks for a further increase, or any increase on top of that, time and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, I do not find the argument put forward by the Under-Secretary convincing. I hope that he will feel able to accept the amendment, but, if not, it is right that we should vote on this specific matter. We can then consider it, should we lose, and, in that unlikely event, the later points could be raised on other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long. We shall discuss the principles relating to the law of bankruptcy, the erosion of values, the diminution of remedies and so on more appropriately at a later stage. But I cannot accept the logic behind the Opposition's reasoning on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true that the way in which legislation as a whole is dealt with in the House of Commons perhaps needs to be re-examined. Indeed, it is being re-examined by the Government. But we are dealing here with a situation which is important but has a limited relevance. One could think of all sorts of other legislation where exactly similar powers, dealing with questions of fees which necessarily are increased because of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0965">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
erosion of money, are before Committees of this House quite regularly. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have considered such matters in relation to patents, civil aviation charges, and soon, all of which have a similar limited importance to groups of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the speed of the review, no doubt we shall touch upon that also at a later stage; but that really is not likely to be germane to the hon. Gentleman's point, because it is bound to take at least two years and possibly three. In the meantime, it is important that we do something about this issue, and it may be important to do something about it again in the future if we have miscalculated, which is a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a point about the provision of Clause 1(2) which provides for "increase or further increase". He says that it is unprecedented. It is not my view that it is unprecedented, but I shall look into that, as no doubt he will, too. The advice I have, however, is that it is not an uncommon provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He says that when he was a Minister at the Treasury it was not unknown for the provisions in relation to the way in which statutory instruments were to be debated and scrutinised by the House to be altered. I entirely agree. I have made concessions of that kind myself, but never along the lines that he has now suggested, and I suggest that he is not able to cite a precedent. Perhaps I ought to challenge him to do that. It would prolong the debate, because he may want an adjournment until then. I do not think, however, that he can cite a precedent that iscomparable to this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, therefore, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee proceeded to a Divi-sion</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Coleman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. A slight difficulty has arisen in that a Division is in progress in another Committee Room where some members of this Committee are detained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The period of time that elapses before the doors are locked is a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English, I am somewhat surprised by your remark, because I understand that you were considering that the length of time should depend on whether there was a Division in another Committee. Clearly the Government's business is extremely heavy at the moment, and they are press-on with it, but it is surely quite intolerable that the proceedings of one Committee should be delayed because the Government are pressing ahead with their programme so fast that the proceedings of one Committee are interfered with by joint membership on other Committees. That strikes me as an extraordinary view. Would you care to consider the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The latter point is a matter which the hon. Gentleman can no doubt take up, if he wishes, on the Floor of the House with the Leader of the House. On the former point, the procedure for dividing in Committee is not the same as the procedure for dividing in the House. When the Chair calls a Division in Committee, the length of time before locking the doors is at the discretion of the Chair. The custom has always been in Committee, as I understand it, that the Chairman waits until he is reasonably sure that all members of the Committee who are likely to be present are present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. English, I am most grateful to you. We have had a little time to raise this point, and I think it is quite a serious one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no official knowledge of where the hon. Members may be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand that. Certainly on other Committees—for example, the Finance Bill Committee—the Chair takes into account the likely whereabouts of Members, particularly if one is continuing long through the night. That, however, raises a separate point from whether there are reasons to suppose that Members are tied up on business elsewhere,which is obviously the case here. I may not press it at this stage, but you may care to consider whether it would be appropriate to make
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0966">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English.

I checked there earlier this morning and said that I would be in Committee Room 15 if Divisions were called.

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, I am somewhat puzzled abcut why Amendments No. 3 and 4 fall. For the convenience of the Committee, I would not wish to move them because clearly it becomes increasingly messy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The anwser is that two blacks do not make a white. There is something in the Bill that was passed on Second Reading, but that is not a justification for moving what must now become a pointless amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I am advised by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Mr. Gould) that there was no call received in the area where he was, which was at the end of the Committee corridor, in another Committee. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
suppose that this is a matter within your discretion, but if there was a failure to communicate in the usual way over a serious issue of this kind it would fall to you to reconsider the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. May I confirm that I was either in Committee Room 10 or immediately outside in the corridor throughout the last 45 minutes or so and heard no call.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look into the circumstances mentioned, but I am fairly certain that it is not possible to go back on the Division. Apart from that, the next item has been called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now find ourselves in some difficulty, because I would certainly feel that the view you, Mr. English, have just expressed is right. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, I think we should proceed on the lines you have suggested. It is now an unbelievably messy situation, because should there be any doubt about the Division—I take the view that there is no doubt whatsoever about it—the amendments which we have said are falling are not falling, and we get into a horrible mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next business has been called. We are on "clause stand part" and we cannot go back on a Division that has already taken place. The circumstances referred to by the Minister can certainly be looked into, but they have nothing to do at this stage with the Committee. Clearly there will be opportunity on the Floor of the House to deal with the clause in any way that the House chooses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to you, Mr. English. For reasons which I have already explained, it would not be appropriate for me to proceed with the amendment to subsection (4) and I would not propose in my remarks on "clause stand part" to refer either to subsection (2), which has now been deleted, or to subsection (4). It would be rather like the smile on the face of the Cheshire cat after he had departed. That is precisely the status of subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to turn to the important points of general principle that have been raised. The clause is concerned with raising the limits which we shall discuss in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0968">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
detail when we come to Schedule 1, which is related to Clause 1. The main point of the clause is that which has been mentioned by the Under-Secretary, namely, the effects of inflation on the monetary limits. I think it is good that the Committee has taken the view it has for the reasons I put forward in the debate on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, if they wish to change the limits at a later stage, will be able to do so in the substantive legislation following the long term review which they are carrying out. The figures which exist for the increase in the number of bankruptcies are very substantial. I will quote one or two figures from a long line of statistics which appeared in 	<i>The Banker</i>in an article by Mr. Glyn Davies called "Britain's Bankruptcy Crisis". The figure in 1939 was 2,590. For reasons that I do not fully understand, the figures during the course of the Second World War were very low—ranging from 75 to 332. By 1949 it was already going up to 1,463 and there was a steady escalation through to 1956 up to over 2,000. By 1963 it had gone up to 3,929 and had reached 4,600 by 1970 and 5,600—that is, another thousand by 1974. The latest figure for 1974—the Under-Secretary may have a later figure—was 5,606.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tremendous increase in the number of bankruptcies under successive Governments. I make no party point on this. The burden which has fallen on the insolvency service has obviously increased substantially. It is appropriate that it should be changed on the lines suggested or on the lines which the amendments seek to impose. On the broad principle, both on the inflation side of things and on the general principle of reducing the burden on the insolvency service, there is no dispute on the facts between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other point which needs to be raised. As I understand it, as a result of a Press notice issued by the Department of Trade, on 17th December 1974, a consultative document has been issued on the EEC Bankruptcy Convention which has been sent to a great many different organisation for them to consider and study. This draft Convention, as I understand it, covers a great many points. I wondered whether the Under-Secretary could give us any idea whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
that Convention will be concerned with the limits for bankruptcy or whether they will remain a matter for independent determination by the member States. Obviously, if there is any move toward uniformity on this there may be substantial difficulties in view of the existence of floating exchange rates. It is important that we are clear whether there is or is not any implication for this clause resulting from the draft Convention which has been issued by the EEC.Perhaps the Minister could also tell us what the present state of play is on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other more detailed point which arises and on which we have not tabled a specific amendment is concerned with the transitional provisions. I suspect that the transitional provisions in Part II of Schedule 1 also end up as another smile on the Cheshire cat's face. I am not clear whether that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May we deal with that when we come to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, I think that we have come to it, Mr. English. It is subsection (3) of Clause 1. If you think it would be convenient to deal with it on Schedule 1, I shall gladly defer my remarks to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of recent events, I do not want to disturb the basic approach of the Committee on this matter and the need to make progress. It may well be that the Under Secretary would like to make some comments on the general approach which the Government have adopted on this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I understand a vote has taken place recently. I am also serving on another Committee along the corridor. I had no indication that the vote was taking place in this Committee, but I was in the close vicinity to the Committee room. I wonder whether something can be done to allow Members who are serving on other Committees to come into this Committee to vote as well. It seems strange that two of us were in the close vicinity but, through no fault of our own, we missed the boat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter which must be taken up afterwards with the Serjeant at Arms. It is not a matter of interest now because we cannot go back
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0969">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
on the Division. We waited a considerable time for the absent Members to come, but they did not, for whatever reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give notice to the Committee that I shall propose to reinstate on Report the situation as it was when the Bill was drafted. The hon. Gentleman must realise that the Government are opposed to the concept which he has outlined, and it is not a question which requires reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reflected upon it, and we thought it wholly inappropriate. I hope that, having said that, I shall not destroy the amiability which has encompassed our thoughts so far. No doubt, the defeat which the Government suffered on that will appear in its proper perspective in due course, but I think that the hon. Gentleman was almost as nonplussed about the situation as I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, the hon. Gentleman has invited me to outline the thinking behind the Government's policies in relation to the Bill, particularly to the monetary limits. I did that on Second Reading, and we then discussed the difficulties which would clearly emerge unless we brought up to date the monetary limits which had been so seriously eroded over all these years. That is the basic tenet of the Government's thinking on this part of the measure. But the hon. Gentleman was right in referring to the inordinately heavy burdens which the insolvency service has had to sustain for some time. It is a burden which reflects upon the efficiency of the service which it is able to offer. It is working in tremendously difficult conditions and is doing an enormously good job in seeking to provide the high quality of service that is necessary. But it would be less than fair to pretend that the burden of work which it is having to undertake can enable it to do the sort of job which it would seek to effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been stated, there has been a marked increase in the volume of work in recent years. It may be helpful to refer to the point which the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) raised. It is an interesting one to which I certainly do not know the answer and which requires a good deal of profound thought: whether the erosion
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
of values has created these difficulties or the diminution of remedies available to creditors. We can only guess at the answer. The guess that the Department has made—helped by the expertise if those who man the insolvency service—is that the erosion of values has contributed massively to the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Worthing wishes to pursue his point it may be more appropriate to pursue it elsewhere in the House—whether there should be new legislation to deal with remedies available to creditors and debtors, and whether we need to rethink the whole approach. To some extent it will be dealt with by the reappraisal that we are undertaking in relation to bankruptcy law, but so far as it is a reappraisal related to that topic it will not embrace fully the points which the hon. Gentleman sought to adumbrate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised by what the Under-Secretary has said. Perhaps he will expand upon it. As I understood it, the idea of the review was to look at the whole law of bankruptcy and insolvency. Clearly an important aspect of that is what alternative remedies are available to creditors who wish to obtain their money. It seems very unfortunate, therefore, if this review is not to examine the alternatives. Surely it happens so infrequently that there is a case for looking at the alternatives, and the review would presumably comment upon those, and any subsequent legislation would consider whether, in keeping the balance between creditors and debtors, some change in this might be necessary. I do not want to tie the hon. Gentleman down if he does not want to reply off the cuff, but it would be very unfortunate if this were so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an extensive review relating to insolvency, and necessarily it will have to undertake a review of the existing methods of debt collection insofar as it relates to insolvency. However, I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman wanted a review far wider than that. In a sense it is the threat of a remedy that is available that figured very substantially in his thinking, as I understood it, when he referred to this matter in the Second Reading debate. He referred in particular to the relevance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0970">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
and importance of the bankruptcy notice, in enabling a creditor to seek to obtain payment without having to go the whole hog and render somebody bankrupt. That is a matter which we shall consider. But there is a whole variety of other aspects of the enforcement of debts which may require even more profound consideration than we are able to undertake within the review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I will certainly look into the terms of reference of the review to see how far we can go along with the Opposition on this matter, and it may be appropriate if the hon. Member for Worthing and I consider the matter toaether as we have been able to in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn from those general remarks to more particular remarks about the erosion of monetary limits in relation to the Bill. The monetary limits which were fixed before 1914 are clearly out of tune with what is required today. However, there have been some monetary limits that were reviewed more recently than that. There were four such monetary limits, but I submit that even those are completely out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there was the maximum amount relating to wages and salary which are capable of ranking as a preferential debt in the division of a bankrupt's estate or the winding up of a company. That was fixed in 1947. The maximum share capital for the winding up jurisdiction of the sheriff's court in Scotland was fixed in 1929. The offence by a past or present officer of a company of concealing or removing property of a company confined to cases where the value of the property exceeds a minimum amount was fixed in 1929; and the minimum amount of a debt to support a bankruptcy petition by a creditor who notifies an application for an administration order was fixed in 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the effect of this clause was to bring the limits up to date, and we had hoped that the Secretary of State would have power to review the position from time to time. Who knows?—he may yet have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument is that we want to avoid unnecessary expense and achieve a total saving of staff if that is possible. I am advised that if the Government's proposals with regard to the change of
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
monetary limits could be introduced, there would be a saving of staff representing about£750,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that the smaller cases, which we are anxious to avoid as far as possible, frequently produce no fees for the insolvency service, although they frequently create as much work for the insolvency service as the larger cases. There has been a deficit of about£3 million a year incurred by the Official Receiver's service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, if we were not able to do something about this critical situation, the Committee must know that the insolvency service considers that it is 300 short of its need of specialist examining staff to carry out the functions which it is required by law to undertake. Therefore, we feel that there is a strong case for pursuing other remedies so far as creditors are concerned. Indeed, in some respects, a debtor is also helped in this regard, because bankruptcy, as the hon. and learned Member said, is a serious matter. Perhaps some people enter into a state of bankruptcy which would be avoidable because they are inadequately advised or because they are panicked into such a position. That is a dangerous situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are putting other remedies before the Committee—the extension of the administration order procedure in the county court and the possibility of increasing the opportunities of entering into compositions with creditors. We would wish to see these remedies pursued, rather than the draconian course of entering into a bankruptcy where that is avoidable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point, to which I have already referred in part, is that we need to make the best use of the available staff—they are very good staff—which we are not doing at present, for the reasons I have already given. These enormous pressures which have affected the health of a number of people in the insolvency service need to be relaxed in the interests ofthe more efficient functioning of the service and in the interests of both creditors and debtors. I fear that this will not be done unless we re-examine the matter along the lines which we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I urge the Committee to support the clause. I hope that we shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0971">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
now be able to look at a later stage at some of the more detailed amendments which will, no doubt, be tabled on Report. We have been denied that opportunity. Nevertheless, having outlined the general principles which underlie the Government's thinking, I hope that the clause will have the support of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not doubt that at the end of the day we shall support the clause, but this debate is of considerable value in enabling us to deal in general terms with some of the considerations which will be common to the consideration of the specific amendments to which we shall soon come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to one or two of these general considerations, avoiding as far as I can repetition of those which have already been mentioned. Everyone who has spoken so far has said what a serious matter it is for a person to he made bankrupt. Of course that is right, and it is a most important consideration on its own. There are two other considerations which have to be balanced with that. We must never forget what a wonderful safety valve bankruptcy is—the fact that a person may voluntarily become bankrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have more experience of this than I have. At least one professional client has said to me recently—I mean, in his professional capacity "What are we going to do? We get people in who are on the verge of a nervous breakdown and they just cannot cope with their affairs. The point comes when, both in their interests and in the interests of their creditors, we say, ' For heaven's sake, take£7.50 found to the office andfile your own petition.' "I am told by those who give people such advice that it is a good process. It is good for the person concerned, and it is good for his creditors. That is a consideration of which we must not lose sight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what we are doing has to be seen—and I am glad at this early stage that we all accept it—in the context of other remedies available. This observation has been madeby me and others in general terms more than once. It is desirable that a word be said about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
remedies that have disappeared in recent years and the remedies that are left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imprisonment of debtors has gone in every case except imprisonment of those who owe money to the Inland Revenue, which has been retained for the simple reason that it is a good remedy. But that means that everybody else has been deprived of what is recognised by its retention for that purpose as the best possible remedy. I think it is also retained for maintenance payable to wives, because there is a field in which enforcement has been notoriously difficult for years, and so that remedy was retained. It is the only one that is effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the figures in my mind at the moment, but the Department can readily obtain them. The pattern of imprisonment for debt is this. An order is made by the court imprisoning the debtor and about nine out of 10—I am not sure it is not 95 out of 100—of the persons against whom such an order was made paid up before the time came for them to go to prison. So it acted 	<i>in terrorem.</i> There is nothing wrong about that. If it produced the result that the creditor had his money without the debtor going to prison, it was an effective remedy, and it is difficult to find any fault with it. But that is gone. It is not available to anybody any longer save for the Revenue and wives with maintenance orders against their husbands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing that has happened in recent years is that it has been made much more difficult to collect small debts in the High Court. The way in which it has been made more difficult is by prescribing that one does not get one's costs if one brings in the High Court an action that could be brought in the county court. I do not know what the limit is now, but I remember on the Administration of Justice Bill 1965, I think it was, it was put up to something in the region of£100. If proceedings were taken in the High Court which could have been brought in the county court. and one recovered£100 or less, one did not get any costs. It was not only a question of not getting county court costs one did not get any costs at all. This was deliberately intended to drive those litigants into the county court. What is not in doubt is this.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The methods of enforcing judgments in the High Court are infinitely better than any available for the enforcement of a judgment made in the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence of that is provided by another Department of State, the Department of Health and Social Security, which, regardless of the penalties about costs, brings all of its small claims in the High Court. Certainly a few years back, as a deliberate matter of policy, they gave up trying to enforce their rights in the county court and brought all their claims in the High Court. The increase in the amount recovered was dramatic for the simple reason that the methods of enforcing a High Court judgment are so much better than those available to the person who sues in the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, of course, the average small creditor—what we are doing affects the small creditor much more than the big creditor, who will not be very much put out by what we are doing—cannot afford to do what the Department of Health and Social Security does and say he will simply bring his action in the High Court; he cannot afford to do that. He knows before he starts that the cost of so doing comes off whatever he recovers, so he is driven into the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The methods of enforcement of a debt in the county court are pathetic. It has even been decided in the case of Vaughan v. McKenzie that the county court bailiff is not allowed to go on the premises unless the debtor says "Yes, do come in." If the bailiff goes along to collect thedebt, or collect some of the possessions in the house in order to pay the debt, he must ask the debtor if he can come in. If the debtor says that he cannot come in, the bailiff must go back and say he is very sorry, but the debtor would not let him in and he cannot collect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those brief observations on these three remedies will show the extent to which the remedies available to a small creditor have been diminished over the last 10 years. It is dramatic, and I am not overstating the case. It is against that background that one has to consider the one remaining effective remedy, which is the bankruptcy notice, and the proceedings
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
which follow if the bankruptcy notice is not complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already referred to a point to which I referred on Second Reading. I do not know what the percentages are, but in a high percentage of cases it never gets beyond the bankruptcy notice. The Minister proposes to extend the period of time available to a person to comply with the bankruptcy notice. we agree with that. There is an amendment to increase the time to 10 days. We shall discuss in future whether that is sufficient. We think it is right that a little longer should be given, not only because seven days is too short for someone to comply with the notice, but also because one of the good features of this as a remedy is that in such a high proportion of cases where a bankruptcy notice is served the person complies with it. Therefore, it is good to give him a little more time to comply and another debt will have been settled without any strictly legal proceedings following.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against the context of the diminution of other remedies that we must consider what we are doing this clause. We have to combine with that another subject which has been referred to,that is, the deposit that has to be made on the filing of a petition. I think it is proposed to put it up to£90. I would ask the Minister and the Committee to consider this. As I say, I am not bothered about big creditors. These limits will not affect them, nor will the deposit. Their debts will be more than£300 anyway. They can find£90 quite easily to make the deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But think of the small man who has perhaps a debt for£100; he will not be able to use this procedure. Let us suppose that he has a debt for£300; he will be just within, but, if the Government go ahead with the whole package as it is emerging from our discussion, very usefully, at an early stage, he will have to find£90 before he can take advantage of this procedure. I suggest to the Minister that, whilst accepting that many of the sums must goup substantially, the whole package as at present presented of doing high. It will tend to take this remedy right out of the scope of far too many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some members of the Law Society who have much more experience of these matters than my part of the pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0973">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
fession feel that we are in danger in the package as at present presented of doing two things: reducing by much too much the availability of this remedy which has proved its worth over so many years, and substituting a second-class service for what has been till now a first-class service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not enlarge upon any of those matters at this stage because to do so would be to go into each of the particular figures, but I hope that the Committee and the Minister, in particular, will bear in mind throughout our discussion of these detailed amendments that there hasnot been merely some diminution, or a little diminution in the remedies available to creditors; there has been a dramatic diminution. Many people feel that if we have the proposal in this package the remedies for a small creditor will be laughably and pitiably small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say a couple of sentences before the Minister replies. It would be helpful if he could comment on the points made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) as a basis for considering the monetary limits in detail when we come to Schedule I. Clearly our basic approach will depend very much on the points that my hon. and learned Friend has made. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether that is the extent of the facilities now available—if that is the right word—or whether there are alternatives which those seeking to obtain their money may resort to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point worth making is that in adopting the approach which my hon. and learned Friend has touched upon one is not really saying "Here are people in difficult circumstances. We will make life even more difficult for them". Clearly, if there are no effective legal remedies available the temptations for those with small debts to resort to harassment or intimidation may grow, and that would be highly undesirable. I hope that the Minister will touch on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). I missed a point when I made my previous observations to the Committee. He asked whether the EEC draft Convention on bankruptcy, which covers a substantial area of bankruptcy law,
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
would be concerned with the monetary limits. The answer is that that will be left to the domestic jurisdiction of member countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present state of play is that negotiations are pending which are delicate and difficult. I think that the hon. Gentleman knows something of the background to those negotiations. There are problems of harmonising the bankruptcy law, and we hope that we shall be able to persuade other Member States to adopt a more flexible approach, but this remains to be seen. There is a fairly long way to go in the consideration of the draft convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an interesting speech, the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) referred to bankruptcy as a wonderful safety valve, good for the person concerned and good for creditors. It was almost like a television advertisement at times—I am not sure that we should not put it on the screen in that way. But I think that he was gilding the lily a wee bit. We have to direct our attention to the extent to which bankruptcy should be readily available asa form of social service. That is basically what underlay the hon. and learned Gentleman's comments. Bankruptcy was not originally contemplated in that light. It was intended as a form of relief for insolvent debtors and to ensure that there would be a fair distribution of the debtor's estate amongst his creditors. It was not really intended to give one creditor a preference over others by the extensive use of a bankruptcy notice. But the hon. Gentleman is right. As there has been an erosion of the remedies and means of redress that are available to creditors, so there has been an increasing use of the bankruptcy procedure, and in particular the bankruptcy notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman reviewed the other remedies that were available, but he did less than justice to some of them. The fact is that the levying of execution and the threat of the levy of execution is very widely resorted to. It has its problems. It is not the most efficient way of providing a remedy for a creditor. Nevertheless, it is something that produces results and it is widely used. Going right back to the days of my articles, I remember that judgment summonses were more widely used in the early 1950s and in my early years of practice than they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0974">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
are today. But they are still fairly widely used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those days. there was the back-up of an order for imprisonment at the end ofit if the orders of the court were not obeyed. I have no doubt that they are widely used now, but only because it is one of the few things that can be done. The real sanction that lay at the end of the road is gone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's point, but even after the sanction of imprisonment was abandoned, it was still a remedy extensively pursued. There have been other remedies, of course. which have fallen into a form of desuetude. I do not know how extensively used the garnishee prooeedings are. "Garnishee" has nothing to do with dining at exclusive restaurants in the West End of London. I will not trouble the members of the Committee who are unfamiliar with this strange phraseology, but it is known to some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the attachment of earnings. That has been more extensively used. It has not got complete relevance to the field we are covering here, as indeed, will be evidenced later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there are charging orders available against the land or shares of the debtor. There is the procedure of administration order which has not been widely used. As I said, frankly, to the Committee, I am a solicitor practising in a working class area, where it is not widely known that this procedure existed. I believe that about 2,500 orders have been made annually. This is woefully inadequate. If we seek to embark upon an extensive use of administration orders, in partial replacement of the bankruptcy remedy, it will be incumbent upon those responsible—as we are in the Government, the Law Society and practitioners generally—to become aware and to make people aware of what I think is a better remedy than the draconian one of rendering somebody bankrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no shortage of remedies. None of them is perfect. This one is not a particularly good remedy. It imposes inordinate burdens—one unnecessarily—upon the insolvency service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether enforcing judgment from the High Court is thought
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
to be a better means of enforcement than enforcement in a county court. Different Government Departments react in different ways. Different lawyers react in different ways to the suitability and appropriateness of a remedy which may be pursued. However, what the hon. Gentleman has said ought to be taken into acccunt and I will certainly do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister would like to inquire from the DHSS, because it is noticeable that the two Government Departments which are concerned most with recovering money from individuals—the Inland Revenue and the DHSS—are better served than most. The Inland Revenue is better served because it can still get an order for the imprisonment of a debtor and the DHSS does it in the way I mentioned. If the Minister could get the up-to-date figures from the DHSS showing whether it still uses the High Court for the recovery of all itssums, that would help the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have permitted a very wide debate on the clause, possibly wider than it strictly merits. The clause simply relates to the increase in monetary limits, but I have permitted a wide debate because the other remedies are of obvious relevance to this question. But getting on to the powers of the Inland Revenue is going too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have noted what the hon. and learned Gentleman said. I have come to the end of my remarks on that point, and I shall look into what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the increase of the deposits payable on a creditor's petition and debtor's petition, respectively. The deposit payable on a creditor's petition will be£90 and on a debtor's petition£50. They are substantial increases, since the original deposits were£7.50 and£5 respectively. It is part of the philosophy I have indicated that we want to avoid as far as possible the use of the remedy of bankruptcy in the mainly domestic or consumer credit cases, because these yield at present insufficient even to meet the cost of the petition. Therefore, the insolvency service is driven to making substantial losses as a result. The cost of administering such cases in bankruptcy is higher
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0975">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
than that connected with an administration order because of the more detailed investigatory procedures involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an unhappy state of affairs. If everything were ideal in this world, if we had a great deal of money to spend, we should perhaps increase the staff available to the insolvency service, but I am not sure, when it came down to the point, that the Opposition were addressing their mind to the alternatives. Are they suggesting—I think I am entitled to ask the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) this question, because we are exchanging friendly views on this matter and the question must be posed and answered—that we should employ more staff in the insolvency service? That would involve increased public expenditure on a quite substantial scale. I have already indicated the difficulties, the shortages of staff and so on, and I do not need to rehearse that again, but I ask him to address his mind to that point. Is he suggesting that we should have higher fees? Higher fees will have no appropriateness to the smaller bankruptcies, because they do not yield anything, as I have already indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember one or two of the remarks the hon. Gentleman made about higher fees being charged in relation to the larger liquidations, when we were discussing Nation Life in the debate on the Policy holders Protection Bill. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the aspects of this problem which I find distasteful is the revelation of the cost of liquidation".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 30th October 1975; Vol. 898, c. 1853.]</p></blockquote>
He cannot have it both ways. He will have a chance to reply to those matters. I certainly do not want to reopen the Nation Life question, but I ask him to consider seriously the argument that he mentioned at one stage—it may have been during Question Time in the House—about having higher fees as part of the remedy, because he has adopted an inconsistent attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we are not arriving at the best possible solutions in doing what we are doing.We are having to achieve an uneasy compromise. Nevertheless, I believe that the principles I have outlined—the philosophy behind the Bill—provide the best remedy for our difficulties at the present time, unless the Opposition are prepared to provide us with some
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
alternatives. Their words have been interesting, sometimes amusing, but singularly unhelpful,and they must address themselves to that proposition. I hope, Mr. English, that we shall be able to proceed as rapidly as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing I was always told as a Minister was " Never filibuster your own Bill". I think that the hon. Member is in some slight danger of doing that. I do not wish to delay the proceedings unduly, but I shall ccmment on the two specific points which he has asked me to answer. Whether we can change sides so that I can do so, I am not sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course one must take into account the question of cost. The Minister well knows our desire to reduce public expenditure. None the less, it is necessary to test each question on its merits, and we are certainly mindful, in considering the limits which are being argued about, ofthe need to hit the right balance—I referred to this in my opening remarks—between the expert and expensive resources required, on the one hand, and the actual service provided, on the other. Obviously, one would need to strike the balance on that, and we shall have an opportunity throughout the debates on the limits themselves to see what balance we thinkis appropriate in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) has pointed out, the question of alternative remedies is extremely relevant in this context, and it is not a simple matter. There are a great many variables affecting the actual burden—not just the limits and the alternative remedies, but the general economic situation, the extent to which people are in economic difficulties, and so on. We shall be debating these, no doubt, on all the individual limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Nation Life question, I totally reject the hon. Gentleman's view that I am in any way being inconsistent. My complaint on the Nation Life scale of fees was that the scale was wrong. May I have the Under-Secretary's attention, since lie has accused me of being inconsistent? The objection to the Nation Life fees was that the actual amount of work involved, particularly in the case of insurance companies, was not related to the fees charged. The scale of fees was wrong, and I am grateful to him for reminding me of that point. We must see what we can do by way of drafting a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0976">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
suitable amendment and covering Nation Life policyholders, probably not retrospectively—he knows my objection to that—either in Committee or, perhaps more appropriately because of the great interest of the House in the Nation Life question, on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish, however, to oppose this clause as such. It seems to be much better than it was when we started our proceedings this morning. I think it fulfils the objects which we should like to have, and no doubt the Minister will be able to put the other matter right when he completes his long-term review and legislates on a broader scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am put in a procedural difficulty which I had not perceived when I first made my observation consequent upon the curious vote that we had. As a result of the amendment which has been carried, I am advised that it render somewhat nugatory the effects of Clause I. In fact, I must now invite the Committee to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, that is an extraordinary statement, and even more extraordinary that the Minister did not mention it in his opening remarks on the clause. To change his mind at this stage of the proceedings, when we were expecting the matter to go through on the nod. seems an extraordinary thing to do. I can only assume that he has done so on official advice. If so, they took something like 40 minutes to change their minds on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely—and I am sure you are, Mr. English—absolutely astonished. In anycase, it is not true. The clause is mainly concerned with implementing the new monetary limits which are set out in Schedule 1. That is what is purports to do, and that is what it does. Not only that. but I was myself mistaken in the effect of the decision we have taken in relation to subsection (3). Obviously, these transitional arrangements do apply to the transition from the existing limits to the new limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing which the clause did was to give the Secretary of State the ability to alter the limit subsequently by order. That is what has been knocked out—admittedly, with the smile on the Cheshire cat's face hanging around on subsection (4). But the main part of
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
the clause, which we support, has in no way been changed. I am giving the Under-Secretary as much time as I can to consider the matter, but I am forced to the conclusion that he must have misunderstood the advice which he has received—or was unable to read it, if I am not being too unkind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main part of the clause is perfectly all right, subject, of course, to whatever we do to Schedule 1. But if he knocks out the clause completely, we cannot have him reinstating it on Report on the ground that he needed the extra powers as well. We must have a clear undertaking, if he proposes to withdraw it now. The whole Bill does not fall. because there are other highly controversial and difficult technical changes as well, but what the Government, in numbering the clauses, clearly regarded as the most important will fall. It would be highly undesirable if what the Under-Secretary has said should take place. The clause is untidy; it fulfils its main object but not the subsidiary object. I hope that the Under-Secretary will agree that it should go forward, and we can proceed to Schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee arrives at any decision, it is only fair to warn it that, if Clause 1 were struck out of the Bill, I should be obliged to revise the whole of my provisional selection and eliminate most of the amendments which I have provisionally selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is too horrible to contemplate. The position is that the amendment has not merely caused the provision to become untidy, as the hon. Gentleman said, but has rendered it rather meaningless. However, perhaps I was a little impulsive. We can live with it until Report, but I say unquestionably that the wholly unexpected success of the Opposition in carrying that amendment is something that we shall have to seek to reverse on Report. The Committee should understand that, in those circumstances, I do not propose to withdraw the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister exemplifies the views of Mr. Mark Twain on the weather in Connecticut "If you do not like it, wait a minute".

It appears that the hon. Members who did not hear it were simply in such a situation that they did not hear it. But I am assured by several people along the corridor that it was taken up. I may add that it has at various times been suggested by some hon. Members that we should revise and adapt this ancient system into something like a personal call system. That has never been taken up by the Services Committee, but clearly the present system has occasional defects, of which this, apparently, was one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coleman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. This is certainly a most unsatisfactory situation, as you have said. A Division was called elsewhere just now. Nobody in this room could understand in what room that Division was being called. In the old days, as
recall, people put their heads inside rooms and heard exactly what was going on.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 18, 19 and 29. I shall leave the explanation to them to the hon. Gentleman when he is allowed to continue his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may do that, Mr. English, we are discussing Amendment No. 29, together with other amendments at your suggestion, and, as I understand it, Amendment No. 29, which is the cause of the trouble is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schedule 1, page 11, line 38, leave out£300' and insert '£200'."</p></blockquote>
Line 38 in the latest copy of the Bill which I now have before me refers to Section 223(a) of the Companies Act—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Minimum debt for winding up on grounds of insolvency,£300".</p></blockquote>
The amendment:suggests that the figure of£200 should be substituted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall turn first to Amendment No. 10. This is, in many ways, the most important figure which we have to consider. The other amendments are concerned either with alternative figures or with the:same concept, as it appears, in later parts of the schedule referring to different groups—for example, companies, instead of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Effectively, we have given the Government a choice in Amendments Nos. 10 and 11. We are suggesting that figure, instead of£300, should be£200, or, if the Government prefer. it could be between£200 and£300, namely,£250. The Government have been helpful in providing my hon. and learned Friend and me with a list of the monetary limits relating to bankruptcy and winding up. I should like to express my appreciation to the Minister for that list. They have given us a list showing the present limit, what is proposed and what would be needed to restore the full value of the original limit expressed in terms of today'sprices or costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present limit, as I understand it, as far as Amendment No. 10 is concerned, is£50. That is the limit which we agreed was set back in 1869 and repeated in 1908 and subsequent enactments. Instead of£50, the Government are suggesting that the figure should not go to that which would restore its full value, but rather that it should go to an intermediate figure, namely£300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
I presume that the reason why the Government have chosen£300 rather than£600 is that they feel that it is not right simply to adjust the measuring rod of money. They consider that they should also have regard to the various factors to which my hon. and learned Friend has already referred. I will not go over those factors again, because the debate on Clause 1 was helpful in clearing a lot of ground. However, there are various factors which suggest that the balance between creditors and debtors has also changed in the course of time. Not only has the measuring rod of money changed, but the balance between creditors and debtors has changed, because creditors now find it more difficult to obtain their money than they did previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken considerable account of that, regardless of the fact that this will inevitably tend to lessen the amount of work left on the the bankruptcy and insolvency service than if they had restored the limit to the full£600.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is the main monetary limit with which we are concerned, I should like to comment on that balance. It is right to say that there is some public feeling that the figure of£300 which the Government have now selected is too low. Obviously, any advocates of pure indexation would regard it as being too low, and there are a number of those in the House and in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting letter has been passed to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Bodmin (Mr. Hicks). He received it from one of his constituents. The lady concerned, whose husband had previously been declared bankrupt, put forward a number of arguments pointing out that if the £50 limit were multiplied to bring it into line with today's values it would be£600. She goes on,
	<br><blockquote><p>"which would be right, to my way of thinking. After all, one could buy a house for£50 in 1914 and one certainly cannot do so for£600 today."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that there is some strength in that argument. I am putting this case because it is a question of hitting the balance. Again, she suggests that she can see the case for the£300 limit in the case of self-employed tradesmen, but she asks what the figure should be so far as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
companies are concerned. I will turn to that point in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After all, what does£300 buy nowadays? A three-piece suite of furniture costs that, and that is not even the most expensive suite of furniture."</p></blockquote>
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Therefore, one could go bankrupt if one owed for a three-piece suite."</p></blockquote>
This is the kind of argument which needs to be taken into account in weighing the various balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lady also makes the point, which I think is relevant, that when her husband went bankrupt in 1969 his largest bill was for£150 well over the£50 limit. At today's values the£150 bill would probably be for£300—still enough for him to be made bankrupt. In other words, she is arguing for the limit to be higher than that which the Government have proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must have sympathy for that but, at the same time, one needs to take account of the arguments which my hon. and learned Friend has adduced, and also the argument which I put earlier—that if there is virtually no legal means of obtaining redress if one is owed money, the temptation to resort to other highly undesirable methods must tend to grow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, and taking this into account, one comes down on the side of the Government to the view that the figure should not be anywhere near as high as that which would simply adjust for the changing values of money. I do not want to prolong the proceedings because the arguments on Clause I have been put, but they do stress the considerable reduction which has taken place in the number of remedies open to those who are owed money. On balance, it is right that we should go for a somewhat lower limit than the Government have suggested. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will have given careful thought to this and will comment on the£200 or£250 limit which we have sung gested as alternatives. There are certainly those in the legal profession who take the view that the£300 limit will cause considerable hardship to those seeking to obtain money which they are owed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
The final point that I should like to raise is the relationship between the limit on companies and that on individuals. That brings me to some of the other amendments—Amendment No. 29, for example, which we took at the beginning of our discussion on the schedule. The schedule has a sub-heading in lines 32 and 33 on page 11: "The Companies Act 1948", under which the minimum debt for winding up on grounds of insolvency is again set at £300. In otherwords, the proposal is that each of the limits in the schedule—under the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1913 which is, I suppose on chronological grounds, taken first, under the Bankruptcy Act 1914 and under the Companies Act 1948—should be£300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, it is a little curious that the limit for the individual should be the same as that for a company. Perhaps, just like Topsy, it is the way it has grown up. Perhaps the House of Commons has never considered whether these two limits should be set at the same figure. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could comment on that. I understand that the present limit is£50 in each case, although the Acts in which it was embodied were not passed at the same time. Indeed, it is rather extraordinary that the limit set in the Bankruptcy Act 1914 for the individual was apparently selected for a company in 1948. That seems upside down. One would have expected it to be higher rather than lower. Therefore, one has a strong suspicion that the matter has never really been seriously considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have, of course, already discussed at length the question of balance and other remedies available, and it is not necessary to rehearse that argument again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as fixing the limit at£300 is concerned, it is perfectly true that some people argue that it is too low and that it ought to be£600. but not only advice from my own officials but also representations from outside bodies led me to the view that the judgment made by the Department initially that a limit of£300 ought to be applied was just about right. We are talking here of a difference between£200 and, in some instances, £250. The hon. Gentleman did not refer to the inconsistency between the various
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0980">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
monetary limits that appear in the amendments, but I assume that he is abandoning the£250 and referring to the£200. We have to have some consistency in this. We cannot have inconsistency between different parts of the United Kingdom. At least, I should hope not, as far as these monetary limits are concerned. I am not quite sure which one he is opting for, but I assume that it was the£200.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite happy for the hon. Gentleman to choose between them on the basis of the argument he adduces. These are clearly probing amendments. Whatever the figure is set at, is is obviously an arbitrary one and a matter of striking a balance. I see no objection or inconsistency in giving the hon. Gentleman a choice in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What lies behind the hon. Gentleman's view is that the Government must be wrong—that it ought to be£200 or£250, but it is inconceivable that it should be£300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has stated more than once that on balance—I think that was the term he used—the Government's thinking on this issue was just about right and that it ought not to have been£600. Equally, on balance we felt, as a matter of judgment, that a figure of£300 was preferable to one of£200. It all goes back to the two salient arguments we have already referred to. First, there is the erosion of monetary limits, which the Opposition are not prepared to meet fully on their arguments. We are prepared to go half way towards redressing that erosion. Secondly, the burden that falls on the insolvency service is a matter upon which I have necessarily to take the advice of those expert in matters affecting the insolvency service. It is their judgment that if one has a figure of£200 or £250 the goal I outlined would not be capable of achievement to the degree that is necessary. A sum of£300 is not satisfactory from that point of view, but it is better. I feel that the hon. Gentleman himself seeks to rely on the advice tendered to him by the Law Society and Justice and I am not sure that he has reflected particularly profoundly upon this matter. It is a difficult one and it is a matter of balance.

On the relationship between the individual and companies so far as monetary limits are concerned, it would add to the complexity of matters if we had different monetary limits. I do not know what lay behind the thinking of those who dealt initially with these matters, but it has become almost traditional now that both the company and the individual should be treated on like basis. Previously a monetary limit of£50 was applicable to both; now a monetary limit of£300 is applicable to both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see that the hon. Gentleman has made out a case for differential treatment. He has merely asserted that he thought it was strange that there should be this consistency of treatment between the company and the individual. I am not sure what he is proposing in its place. I do not know whether he is suggesting that we should radically rethink the position. If he is saying that, why? The burden of proof falls upon him in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do think that the position as between companies and individuals should be radically rethought. Perhaps it is too late in this Bill, but in the profound review which is to take place later, the assumption that the two figures should be the same ought to be substantially changed. I am bound to say that it is difficult to quarrel with the Government's judgment of£300 on the actual figures. It is very much taking the middle course and splitting the difference. So, for that matter, are the figures of my hon. and learned Friend. I do not wish to argue with the Minister on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when one is getting to larger figures, the position of the individual is different from that of the company. Looking at it as a tendency, I favour fewer bankruptcies for the individual, but at the same time I think that the facility of making companies go into liquidation ought to be as easy as it is now, if not easier, because a lot more companies ought to be wound up than are. It is much healthier for the economy if assets, in human, material and financial resources, are made to spread and move about rather more than they do at present. That is a good tendency, but it is not a tendency which applies to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
kind of individuals whom we have been discussing this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if one believes that the bankruptcy of individuals should be made harder, but that the liquidation of companies should be made no harder, the time has come to consider whether what is purely a historical assumption that the figure should be the same for both ought to be looked fundamentally at the suitable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. and learned Gentleman says. Of course, it will be considered in the wider review. I was simply saying that making an assertion for the purpose of the Bill was rather unrealistic. The importance of what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said is a matter for the wider review, and it will be undertaken then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the decision here is a matter of judgment. What we need at this stage is as much information as we can have enabling us to form that judgment. The Minister today has referred to outside representations, from which I deduce that he was referring to outside representations received before the Bill was presented. I will not hark back to the unhappy affair of the lack of consultation. Since it was drawn to the attention of everybody concerned, I am happy to acknowledge—as did my hon. Friend in his opening speech—that the bodies to whose attention it should have been brought have been fully consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reference to outside representations is he referring to some from bodies other than those which have been consulted since? I think that the bodies, to a man, which have been consulted since the Bill was presented have said that£300 was too high. If I am wrong about that, could the Minister tell us about any outside body which has said that the figure of £300 is right, and of any body which has not asked him to reduce it? I believe that all the outside representations have been to the effect that£300 is too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two sides to be considered in arriving at the right judgment. One is the consumer's side—those who use the bankruptcy proceedings. As I understand it, to a man, they say that£300 is too high. But that is only one side. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
other side is reducing the load on the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped that we should learn from this debate the details of how the load was to be reduced. We may still get them if it is resumed on Thursday. If the figure was raised to£200, the load on the Department would be substantially reduced by that alone, presumably. Can the Minister tell us, in the last year for which figures were known, how many were under the£300 limit, how many were under the£250 limit and how many were under the£200 limit? We would like to know to what extent the load would be lessened by the choosing of any of these three figures, and to what extent it would differ.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Raising the figure to£200 would of itself, presumably, reduce the load by a substantial number. I believe that the present complaint which is rightly made by the service is that there is an inordinate number of very small bankruptcies. They would all be cut out by the£200 figure. Before we come to a decision on this figure, surely we ought to know this: if the figure were raised to£200, how many of the current number of bankruptcies would be removed? The second question may not necessarily be the same thing, but it may be. To what extent would that reduce the burden on the service? How many extra staff, if any, would be needed to cope with the situation if the burden was reduced by raising the limit to £200? How could that additional burden—in effect, it would be a considerable reduction of the burden—but if that was not a sufficient reduction to enable the present establishment to deal with the situation, how many more staff would be needed to deal with that reduced burden and what would the cost of that be? Could that be dealt with by increasing the fees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we know that, then, and then alone, we shall be able to reach a decision on whether we should take the figure of£200. Of course, I would not suggest taking it in isolation. One would like to have the same information about the figure of£250. I realise the difficulty of this exercise, because it is not enough to take the current figure; one must take the expected figures for the next year and the year after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this is a matter of calculating the burden on the service, how to reduce it,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0982">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
and by how much to reduce it. In this instance, as I understand it, we are thinking simply ofthis: the higher we put that limit, the smaller the number of bankruptcies there will be, and therefore the greater will be the reduction of the burden on the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we approach it on that basis—and my hon. Friends and I agree that it is a perfectly sound basis on which to approach the matter—we are faced with a decision. The Minister says, without at the time having received representations from outside, that in the Government's judgment the figure should be£300. We know that a lot of consumers say that£200 is the right figure. Others think that£250 is the right figure. Although the differences may be small in absolute terms, I suspect that they could make a lot of difference to a lot of people. Before we make a decision on which of those figures is the correct
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
one, we must know what would be the practical effect of adopting one or the other, the£200 or the£250 or the£300 limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to reply now; there is not time. I had hoped to ask these questions earlier, because I imagine that those sums have already been done. Therefore, it would only be a matter of passing the answers up to the Minister. if those sums have not already been done, I am not clear what basis was adopted in arriving at the figure of£300, or the saving of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
