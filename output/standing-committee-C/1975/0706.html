	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether we will be able to operate with the dcor open, Mr. Crawshaw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should do whatever is convenient to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we could ask the people in the corridor to be a little quieter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether we can do that, but perhaps we can close the door until the people in the corridor have dispersed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to the first clause of the Bill and the general principles embodied in it. We have discussed already some of the aspects which affect it. The Under-Secretary will be well aware that we are in favour of measures to ensure that the accounts which companies are, by law, required to produce are, in fact, produced on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly it is difficult under the present arrangements for the Government and their officials to ensure that such accounts are produced. Indeed, there are great problems in pressing companies and their directors. There is no difference between us on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that we on this side of the Committee want to improve the Bill and ensure that companies operate within a sensible framework which can be properly enforced. That having been said, we have very considerable concern about the way in which the Bill has been drafted. This clause is related to 11 other clauses, all concerned with the particular point about the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Duty to prepare, lay and deliver accounts by reference to accounting reference periods".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
There is here a considerable difference from the existing law under which companies are operating, and it is the existing law with which they have become familiar over a period of years.Although some companies may delay in producing their accounts for one reason or another, not least in the case of small businesses because of the need to concentrate on the actual running of the business, they have all become used to the existing system. Therefore, a change in the law, although not tremendously onerous for the large company employing accountants, solicitors, and so forth—it is just one of the occupational hazards of modern life—isvery important indeed for the small business. We in the Conservative Party have become increasingly concerned about the tremendous burdens placed on small businesses which mean that the few individuals engaged in running them spend a higher proportion of their time on filling in Government forms, surveys and Price Commission documents as well as preparing the main reports themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously we need to look at the matter in relation to the different sizes of companies. We had an amendment on the Order Paper before which was very complicated, as it involved the selection of arbitrary figures to determine whether a company was large or not. On reflection, we admit that there were objections to that amendment, and we did not want our main arguments to be obscured because of the complexity of our Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to look at this clause particularly in relation to small businesses and we will need to consider our position at a later stage of the Bill, or when a similar expanded Bill comes forward next Session. Therefore, it is necessary for the Minister to spell out the points in the clause in relation to other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recently formed body—the Society of Conservative Accountants has done a considerable amount of analysis on this Bill and its drafting, as well as the principles which underly it. The Department of Trade has now received a copy of the society's recommendations. These recommendations include
	<br><blockquote><p>"A diagram showing the 85 cross-references in the first 11 clauses dealing with a company's accounting reference period."</p></blockquote>
There was some discussion a few weeks ago in the House about whether an oil rig was a ship. The Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
for Industry circulated photographs of the vehicle—if one can call it a vehicle—in question. In the past documents have been circulated for the convenience of the Committee. Therefore, if it is in order, it may be helpful to let you, Mr. Crawshaw, the Minister and others, have copies of this document, because it illustrates far better than any words of mine what is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for the Chair to circulate papers of this nature. If the hon. Member wants to do so, it is up to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if I could do this, Mr. Crawshaw, because it shows just how complex the structure of this Bill is. It is quite remarkable that the Bill should be drafted in this way. One only has to look at the diagram, which looks like a painting by Jackson Pollok.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a Bill, starting from scratch, under which the man running the ordinary corner shop has to decide what he is obliged to do and how one clause relates to another. We get a lot of complaints about the complexity of drafting in legislation. In fact there was a letter on this in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> yesterday. But there are few Bills as complex as this one. We are very worried about the effect on small businesses in particular because we believe that the Bill will provide them with another very real burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point touched on by the Under-Secretary was whether it is, in fact, feasible to have one system for one size of company and a different system for another size. We understand the problems which will arise here, especially in relation to the situation if a company goes over the borderline drawn. One possible solution is to operate the new system for large companies only and to allow small companies to operate the old system. However, we realise that this presents very real problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to press the Government on whether the changes being made here are really necessary in order to achieve the objectives we all wish to achieve. If they are necessary, would it not be possible to introduce them in some simpler way than that which the Government have suggested?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
The central aspect of this clause is the change to accounting reference periods. As the preamble to the Bill says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause J requires the directors of every company to prepare accounts in respect of each accounting reference period, normally one year."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, this is a significant change from the existing system. The expression or concept of an accounting reference period has been imported from the Price Code, instead of sticking to the existing principle of the financial year. What we are not clear about is why it has been necessary, in order to ensure that accounts are produced on time, to change the basis from the financial year, which is well known and familiar to everyone, to a new system of accounting reference periods which are not directly related to the fundamental accounts of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to explain why this massive change in drafting has been introduced. It is an extremely complex matter. Clause 1 runs almost to three full pages and the implications for companies are very considerable indeed. I hope that as a basis for our consideration of the line we should take at later stages of the Bill we will have from the Minister an outline in broad terms of the reasons which have encouraged him to change the law in the way suggested in the clause. Would not alternative measures be less disruptive and time consuming for businesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the weekend I had a very interesting discussion with a small businessman who is a toolmaker. He told me that in recent years life in his firm had become so difficult as to discourage any further expansion of his business. First, there is the high level of taxation, and then there are the unending questionnaires and official documents which his firm is obliged to deal with and submit to various Departments of State. He told me of a questionnaire he had received from a Department of State which was as thick as the Bolton Report and required the answers to numerous questions. He failed to comply fully with the requirements of the questionnaire and, as a result, his directors were fined 100. As a result of this experience, he now answers every question on a questionnaire whether or not it really relates to his firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, he is often asked questions like "How many nails do you use?" He replies that he uses 20 lbs. one month,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
and 25 lbs. the next. He is also asked "How much paint do you use"? He answers that as well. But, in actual fact, his firm uses neither nails nor paint. However the official Department is happy because the questionnaire has been filled in; and he is no longer fined. So the game goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 perpetuates the kind of difficulties experienced by small firms in having to deal with so much administration. The document circulated by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) shows the veritable web of obligations which are placed on com- panies by this Bill. Clause 1 alone involves eight cross-references to other clauses, and I pity the poor working director or part-time company secretary who has to try to work these out in relation to a small manufacturing company, like the ones in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitable that small firms will find this Bill an additional burden, and we should consider their problems very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that some members of the Committee will consider that the Bolton Report definition of small firms is not ideal. At least it has the advantage of giving us a basis for trying to distinguish between them and the large corporations which have the apparatus necessary to deal with the demands of the Companies Acts. At the same time, we can realise and recognise the very real decline of small firms, and that presents a real danger to the economy. That danger can be easily understood since small firms like the one I have described are key suppliers of parts to the assembly industries, key suppliers of highly specialised machine tools in export markets. The upturn in trade depends very much upon the efficient manufacturing capacity of these firms and the contribution they make to the economy. The ability to innovate and succeed in manufacturing industry depends to a great extent on working directors of small firms being able to concentrate on manufacturing rather than on form filling and administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the firms in my constituency are typical in this respect. There might be one, two or three directors of the firm who spend their day on the shop floor engaged in manufacture primarily for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
export market. They have no company secretary or office available to deal with the requirements of the Bill. It is, therefore, vital that the provisions of the clause—backed up as they are by the penalties in Clause 4—do not constitute the straw which will break the back of the small firm. Surely it is unreasonable to expect small firms to go to the expense of producing accounts in some printed form, the nature of which we do not yet know. It was for that reason that we thought it would be a good idea to specify the form in which the accounts should be produced. That is why we do not want to leave the method of reproduction to be determined by means of regulation, and that is why we propose that the requirement to produce accounts in a legible form should be sufficient. That is why we shall return to this matter on Report, as no doubt the Government will, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must say what real advantage there is to the nation in compelling these small firms to provide more information in some printed form. The Bolton Report defines the small firm, first, as one with a relatively small share of the market. A second essential characteristic is that it is managed by its owners or part owners in a personalised way and not through the medium of a formalised management structure. That characteristic should be taken very much to heart by the Department in considering how the Companies Acts should apply to this type of enterprise. A third feature is that the company is also independent in the sense that it does not form part of a larger enterprise, and that the owner-managers are free from outside control in taking their principal decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These three factors constitute what the Bolton Report called an economic definition. But it felt obliged also to use a statistical definition, and this was set at the 200-employee upper limit for manufacturing, and a more or less arbitrary series of definitions were adopted for other trades. The definition on page 3 of the Bolton Report provides a useful basis on which the Government could consider making exceptions and distinctions for the smaller type of firm. Behind that definition lies the seed corn of British manufacturing industry, the major servicing firms of tomorrow. Collectively their economic contribution is enormous. Individually it might be minute, so why is so much information needed? Is it to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
assist their creditors? Surely not. The creditors who may need information about small firms are able to obtain it now and would in any case require much more up-to-date information on the trading position of the company than would be represented by the production of these accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a large number of small firms. The Bill therefore imposes twin burdens. t imposes the burden on companies of having to file, and upon the Registrar of having to check up that they have done so. What, I wonder, will that cost the country; and how many extra staff will be required for the purpose? Why is it that these small firms are to be called upon to assemble information which in many cases will never be looked at, but which in some cases will be looked at very carefully by our foreign competitors. I refer of course to the danger presented to the single-product company in having to file this type of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore ask the Under-Secretary in all seriousness to have regard to the position of the small company. I know that he admires it and understands the contribution it makes to the economy. I realise that to make distinctions and definitions requires innovation, but, knowing the Under-Secretary as I do, I am certain that that is not beyond his powers. It is, therefore, very important in considering the clause that we pay regard to the real problems being expressed, not in the board rooms but on the shop floors of the small firms which are the manufacturing seed corn of our industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt in my mind when we consider so large a body of small firms—they are in excess of half a million—that there is a need for some differential criteria in the way in which they are to be dealt with. I am sorry that the Bill does not provide for that. My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) has suggested how the Bolton definitions might be used by the Government in considering how to provide some differential criteria between the larger and the small firms. Of course, such criteria are already used by the Government. When they differentiate between the higher and lower rates of corporation tax they effectively distinguish between the larger and smaller firms. The tax works on a profit basis, but in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
rough and ready way it must differentiate in that way. If the rule that the 42 per cent. rate had been paid in the previous year was applied, 95 per cent. of companies could be treated differently. I do not think that would present great difficulty, and it would give a different line of approach for the Government in seeking to find some way of freeing the smaller company from these obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see how the information required will benefit anybody. It will be out of date—by seven months in one case and 10 months in another. If it is to be collated for a statistical purpose, it will come too late. To have z million extra sets of statistics cluttering up the files seems to me just to be adding to the chaotic conditions in which the country finds itself, with us getting deeper and deeper into debt. I do not think that the two factors are unrelated. The more obligations that are placed on business by Government, the less is business able to handle the problems presented to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Smaller businesses are extremely confused. They have to contend with regulations covering hire purchase, labelling and the Factories Acts. They have to deal with PAYE. They must cope with capital gains tax and capital transfer tax—which together can combine to kill a business if it has been successful over the years. There is the Employment Protection Act, training boards' questionnaires, and the potential wealth tax. All these matters have to be read up by the unfortunate small businessman as he expands his business. He is not legally trained, and when he goes to legally-trained people they charge him high fees—I have done this myself in seeking the advice of Counsel—and is left with a large bill and he sort of information which makes him wonder why he bothered to begin this whole document reading game in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking last week to an upholsterer who is a former civil servant. He was horrified at what the bureaucracy is doing to small firms through both Government and Parliament, supported by massive legislation. He said that he could no longer bear the kind of spying that went on. He said that people had been in spying on his female staff trying to discover whether they were misbehaving under the social security regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. In your position you can obviously apply some liberality of approach in the debate, but when the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) discusses the affairs of the Department of Health and Social Security, and so on, what limits are to be imposed on the breadth of the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is right. I cannot see that the hon. Gentleman's present point is material. I hope that he will not proceed on those lines. The rest of what he was saying was, I thought, in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that these small people are burdened from too many quarters, and if the Bill is to go through as it is, it presents yet another burden for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are too many bankruptcies. Members of small business firms can no longer watch properly the liquidity problems of their firms. They are too busy dealing with documentation, too busy trying to relate one clause to another instead of getting on with the administration of their firms. As the firms expand they have to think out how to build up their administration. That in itself is a burden on the small businessman. To a degree he can think about building upthe administration to cope with the burden the Government are putting upon him, of course, but the degree has gone too far. We ought to remember that the Houses of Parliament were burned down in 1834 because of wooden tallies which had been collected and which formed the records of tax claims from throughout the century. When they became too numerous and the House was bulging with them, they had to be destroyed because they were useless, and so the whole place burnt down. This registry filled with these ancient records will serve no more useful purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are such severe fines on the small businessman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. This is a matter which will be dealt with in subsequent provisions of the Bill. Is the hon. Member therefore not pre-empting what may be discussed later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to say that the hon. Member is out of order before I have heard what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter is essential to Clause 1, because it relates to the fact that under the clause the Government will insist on considering all businesses as being alike for this purpose. I want the Government to consider separating one kind of business from another. If they will not do that, will they at least consider placing a different maximum fine on different types of businesses? Surely, a major business is at an advantage over the small business if it fails to put its accounts in at the proper time. This would change the effect of Clause 1, because it would enable the smaller business to be separately treated. That is what I am trying to get over to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State said on Tuesday of last week that there was a context in which placing no additional burden on companies was being put forward as an important point of view.He went on to say that that was not a realistic way of looking at the Bill. Is it not a realistic way of look at the Bill? What is the purpose of the Bill? We have never really had a full explanation of what good it will do to the 500,000 or 600,000 firms. Is it really the purpose of the Under-Secretary to place additional burdens on companies without any good reason? I think he ought to explain that more fully to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) went to the heart of the matter just now when he asked whether the Government would consider separating one kind of company from another. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) said in introducing the" stand part " debate, we on the Conservative side have no objection whatsoever to the principle of companies filing their accounts more quickly, and to the other principle underlying the Bill of giving the auditors further powers and, it may be, responsibilities. We are very concerned about the greater burdens placed on all companies, no matter what their size and no matter, therefore, what the extent of their obligation to the community.

	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
As my hon. Friends have said this morning, we feel very strongly that here there is a reasonable distinction to be drawn between the larger companies—which clearly have, with their greater number of employees, far more obligations to the community and to society at large—and the smaller companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite clear from EEC legislation and EEC directives, which we were debatin the Chamber about two weeks ago, that sooner or later we in this country will have to move somewhere along the lines of Continental practice in accepting that there is a difference between public limited liability companies and private limited liability companies. The fifth EEC directive, which we were considering the other day, applies only to public companies on the Continental model, where there is a different form of legal incorporation applicable to the public and to the private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are eventually to harmonise with the EEC in terms of the draft directives, some sort ofsimilar description between the public limited liability company and the private limited liability company will, I submit, have to be adopted here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the Bill, this is surely the time at which to make a start. It is noticeable that in the recent consultative document put out by the Department of Trade, headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Aims and Scope of Company Reports"</p></blockquote>
the Department is stating that it sees the need for some exemptions for smaller companies. I quote briefly from paragraphs 15 and 16 of the consultative document. Under the heading "Exemptions for smaller companies " it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a good case for arguing that small companies should not be subject to such extensive disclosure requirements as large companies."</p></blockquote>
Later in paragraph 15 it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Also, a requirement to disclose an ever increasing amount of information imposes a relatively heavier burden on the administrative resources of a small company than a large one."</p></blockquote>
Conservative Members would certainly agree with that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 16 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present all companies of whatever size have to disclose the same information apart from afew minor exceptions under the 1967 Act. It may be that the existing requirements are alreadyunnecessarily onerous in the case of very small companies, and certainly if additional requirements are to be imposed, consideration should be given to exempting smaller companies."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
I speak now with particular reference to the accounting reference period, which is introducedin Clause 1, but which then continues as a theme right through Clause 7 to Clause 11. When Ifirst read the Bill I found—I referred to it on the Second Reading—that these clauses, as drafted, were extraordinarily tortuous and complicated. I found it very hard to understand them, and I imagine that the proprietors of most small businesses will find it equally hard or harder. I think that one hon. Gentleman opposite is nodding his head in agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extraordinary chart that my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing has produced this morningexemplifies admirably in pictorial fashion just how complex and how tortuous is the mass of cross references to the accounting reference period in the first eleven clauses of the Bill. My hon. Friend, with his literary background, referred to it as looking like a Jackson Pollock picture. I thought it looked like a diagram produced on a spectograph by one of my small children. Whichever it be—a Jackson Pollock picture or something produced on a spectograph—it will cause dismay to smaller businesses throughout this country when the financial year to which we are all accustomed is changed to this accounting reference period, with this maze of cross references which appear in the first 11 clauses of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can well be described as complex nonsense, and I hope that the Under-Secretary, in reply to the "stand part" debate, will tell us why he thinks it is necessary for the accounting cross reference period to be introduced, and whether there is not a case for exempting the smaller companies from it. But, more profoundly, would it not be better to scrap the accounting reference period altogether and keep to the well-tried principle of a profit and loss accountprepared in respect of a financial year? Perhaps that could be done slowly. We might add thatthe financial year must begin at the end of the immediately previous financial year and end not more than eight days before and not more than six days after a date which is 12 months after the first day of the financial year. I would certainly support that sort of tightening.But this maze of references to a new concept, the basic need for which we do not appreciate, I believe to be unacceptable.

I hope that it is unacceptable to the Committee as a whole. But certainly it will cause dismay in the hearts of many small companies up and down the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to be able to establish to the Committee that the views expressed by hon. Members opposite are substantially misconceived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with the observations of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), which were in fact taken up in a variety of ways by his hon. Friends. He said that, in effect, he was at one with the Government in seeking to maximise the efficiency of the system of filing accounts, but had doubts about the practicability and the efficacy of the system which had been devised. In that respect his views seemed to be shared by two of his hon. Friends, but not, of course, by the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge), who does not believe that any small firms should be subjected to the regime, not merely of filing accounts but even of preparing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has certainly misinterpreted what I said. I did not say that small firms should not prepare accounts or that some filing system might not be generally applicable to them. What I said was that the systems for the larger and smaller businesses should be separated so that the smaller companies at least would not have to suffer the difficulties of having their directors spending time on this work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can interpret his speech as he deems appropriate. I fear that I interpret it differently. I am glad to see that he is resiling from the position he seemed to occupy at an earlier sitting. However, I did not really regard his remarks as being essential to the issues we are debating this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has just made a personal reference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have further opportunities. This is not like a debate on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), although he shared the Government's objectives, felt that the way in which the Government sought to achieve those objectives was incorrect. In that respect, as I shall hope to establish to the Committee, he was taking issue with the previous Conservative Administration, because the clause we are now debating is virtually identical—as, indeed, are the clauses relating to accounts generally—with those which appeared in the 1973 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true that the order of the clauses has been varied and that there have been some minor drafting changes and a few amendments designed to meet technical problems. It is perfectly true that the term "accounting reference period" is a new term in relation to this Bill and in relation to company law. The term "financial year" however, in the 1973 Bill, was in all respects analogous to the term which we are now using. The term "financial year" in the 1973 Bill could have been interpreted, in fact, as meaning two things. It could have been interpreted as applying to the existing law before it was to be changed. It could also have been interpreted to mean what the accounting reference period is intended to mean in this legislation. There was no essential difference between what the then Government intended and what is intended here. I appreciate that in no way are the present Opposition bound by the policies of their predecessors, but the Opposition are seeking to depart from those policies in almost every material particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not accept what the hon. Gentleman has just said. This is in no way a disgression, but we are in some difficulty in regard to obtaining copies of the 1973 Bill. The Library has only one copy. By chance, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) has one. As far as we can establish, those are the only two copies extant outside the Government. I cannot imagine what has happened to them, but it is a little suspicious. It makes it very difficult for us simultaneously to comment on the kinds of points the Under-Secretary is now making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

None the less, in view of what the Under-Secretary is saying—and I do not accept it—will he tell us precisely to which clauses in the 1973 Bill he is referring, and how their length compares with the ones he is now saying are the same in this Bill? Will he also say what reference there is in the earlier Bill to an acconting reference period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be responsible for some things, but certainly not for the disappearance from civilization of copies of the 1973 Bill. Perhaps it is the Conservative accountants who have managed to deprive the House of all the remaining copies of the Bill. However, I want to try to help the hon. Gentleman. I am seeking to submit to the Committee that the term that we have used is in no material sense different from that which was used in Clause 58.

It may be helpful if I interrupt my own remarks to pursue the invitation of the hon. Gentleman to give him a rundown on the similarity of clauses. Perhaps he would be good enough to note it, so that I need not make this intervention again. Clause 1 is based on Clause 58, Clause 2 on Clause 61, Clause 3 on Clause 62, Clause 4 on Clause 60, Clause 5 on Clause 105, Clause 6 on Clause 59, Clauses 7 and 8 are taken from the schedules, Clauses 9 to 11 are based on Clauses 98 and 99—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we are getting to the end of his list, I have allowed the Under-Secretary to proceed, but it is not relevant to the " clause stand part " debate. I know that the Under-Secretary was encouraged to do this, but we are debating "clause stand part ",and it would be relevant to mention the clauses relevant to the one that we are now discussing. I hope that we are not going to go on all day, otherwise there will be arguments presented from both sides as to whether the various clauses match.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a pity that you intervened, Mr. Crawshaw, with respect, because I was coming to the end. It will be helpful to the Committee, because the 1973 Companies Bill seems to be in such short supply, if I conclude. It will not take long. Clause 12 is based on Clause 63. I do not like to say that we have copied the Conservative legislation in a considerable respect, but we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Relating directly to this clause which we were told is related to the old Clause58, I hope that it has not escaped the notice of the Minister that the clause we are now discussing is almost twice the length of Clause 58 on which it is said to be based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the outset that I would not discuss the number of lines that appeared or the number of commas, semi-colons, colons or full stops, except to say that we are better at punctuating than the Opposition ever were. I said that there were minor aspects of drafting which had to be corrected. Representations were made which required us so to do. Amendments had to be introduced to deal with technical problems of a minor character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has had the opportunity—I would have thought that he would have done it before—to compare not simply the number of lines and commas, and so on, but the content of the clause. The hon. Gentleman made much play of the number of cross-references that appear and he has produced this rather startling diagram that I may stand on a stall at Hampstead Heath next Saturday and sell as a prize exhibit, if I can manage to get over the copyright problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I daresay that the Conservative accountants, who are notable for their artistic ability—I shall not comment on their professional capability—would have been able to providea similar drawing illustrating the cross-references in the 1973 Bill. What we have got to get down to is not so much these beautiful patterns but what this admittedly complex series of provisions in both Bills were designed to do, and whether this objective has substantially been effected by the provisions that we are now putting before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think in fairness the Minister should add that the Conservative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0733">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
accountants themselves have produced a series of amendments greatly changing the whole structure of the Bill which poses the kind of complexity to which they rightly draw attention. After all, the Minister has had more than two years in which to improve the matter but in fact he has made it a great deal more complex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that the Conservative accountants have achieved that objective. However, what it really comes to is that the hon. Gentle- man is poised between two points. He was asking before—why not retain the existing system for small companies? I donot know whether this is in accordance with the brief he is now arguing. The hon. Gentleman and I have crossed swords on a number of occasions. I think that consistency is not one of his greatest characteristics. The present system has in a number of serious ways been tried and has not succeeded, as may have been implied by hon. Members, but has been found to be seriously wanting. It is because of that that we are putting these proposals before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on a previous occasion that I considered as regards the smaller companies that there is a case for considering the disclosure requirements which have to be imposed upon them. There is a need to look at the range of information that is required from them. However, that is quite different from the basic requirements which this Bill, the Conservative Bill, and any other Bill or other proposals which might be contemplated, must assert. It is a great pity that the hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) has left. I would have thought that, as he challenged me on a number of matters, he would have had the courtesy to remain. However, having said that, there are certain basic requirements that have to be imposed on all companies. I find it extraordinary that the idea should be canvassed by the Opposition that that is not so. Not only has it been expressed from time to time in their speeches, but it has been expressed in their amendments, and we have dealt with these matters earlier in this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman questions the Government's good faith about dealing separately in a material respect with private companies as distinct from public companies, he should recognise that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
have made provision that a public company is required to file its accounts within a period of seven months, whereas the private limited company is given 10 months, so there is that distinction. I know that there is not a distinction drawn in terms between the smaller and larger companies, but by and large the distinction is there, and by and large the private companies represent the smaller segment of private enterprise in this country, and the public companies represent the larger one. So there is that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no intention of imposing new requirements on small companies, or on any company for that matter, without first considering whether that requirement is needed and whether it is unduly burdensome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt in passing with the observations made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) and I now return to those of the hon. Member for Worthing. He says that companies have got used to the present law. That may well be, but the present law, as I have already said and, I would have thought, established on previous occasions to the Committee, has not succeeded. We have these appalling figures. Out of the 643,000 companies on the register, 186,000 are known to be in default to some degree. That is not a position that I should have thought would be acceptable to the House of Commons. Therefore, the present law is not sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty in enforcing the prompt filing of accounts occurs because the existing legal requirements are not defined with sufficient precision, and the Registrar finds it very difficult to identify the moment at which default occurs. The reason for that lack of precision is that a company is not required under the terms of the present law to have any definite period as to its financial year. "Financial year" is defined simply as the period covered by any profit and loss accounts laid before the company in general meeting, irresspective of whether that period is a year or not. Accordingly, the length of the financial year can vary from year to year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be helpful if I were to spell out to the Committee what the existing requirements are, in order to illustrate again the difficulties which arise. Accounts have to be laid before the company in general meeting. By that I do not mean an annual general meeting,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
necessarily. That has to be done at least once in every calendar year. This is dealt with in Section 148 of the 1948 Act. The accounts have to cover the period since the date to which the accounts previously laid before the company were made up and they have to be made up to a date not more than nine months before the general meeting before which they are laid, and, if the company does business abroad, 12 months. That, too, is dealt with in Section 148 of the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once in each year the company has to make an annual return. The annual return has to be completed within 42 days of the annual general meeting. The company has forthwith to send a copy of it to the Registrar of Companies together with a copy of the accounts which have been laid before the company during the period covered by the return. That is one of the problems that I think the hon. Gentleman knows has created massive problems. The company has to hold an annual general meeting in each calendar year and not more than 15 months must elapse between successive annual general meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this requirement is that they allow companies a huge amount of latitude as to the timing of what they have to do. It means that a company can legitimately delay the filing of accounts for up to there years after the period to which those accounts relate. I should not have thought that Opposition Members would have found that an acceptable state of affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously we are following closely what the Minister is saying. Could he spell out the precise example he has just quoted of a delay of three years? What would need to happen under the existing system for the accounts to be filed three years late. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman could do that. I had some difficulty in reconciling that figure with the broad description that he gave before. We are nct prejudiced in any way against what he is proposing, as against the existing proposals. We want to ensure that it is done as simply as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will go into that detail in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pursue the gravamen of what I am urging. I said before that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
Registrar also had considerable problems in identifying whether default occurred at any specific time. He has no means of knowing whether an annual return which has been filed with him should have accounts annexed to it. Then the problem arose also in the case of Stockdale v. Coulson, where it was held that a director could not be convicted of failing to annex copies of accounts to annual returns if no accounts had been laid before the company, even though a failure to lay accounts was itself a breach of the Companies Acts. That was a decision which, at the time I found surprising. It was a decision of the courts. t is one that we must respect. Even when a conviction arises, the courts are reluctant to impose more than a fairly nominal penalty. We have the build-up of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should small companies be exempt from these basic provisions? No one who has seriously argued this case before the Committee chose to say what additional burdens were being imposed on the small companies. I submit that the Bill does not increase the burden on the small companies. Already they must prepare, lay and file accounts under the existing law. The new provisions will clarify and simplify the existing requirements, which are confused. They will not involve any more paper work. There would be no advantage to small companies if we perpetuated the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies House intends to send cut guidance notes to all companies explaining in layman's language exactly what they must do. In practice the new system is not complex. The drafting is complex. That arises from a need to make transitional provisions and to provide for certain exemptions. It is similar to the drafting in the 1973 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accounting reference period is not based in any way on the Price Code. It is not a massive change. It is a minor change. Although it is a new term in company law, it is the period by reference to which accounts must be prepared. It is broadly equivalent to the company's financial year. The term is defined in Clause 1(1) as being the period covered by the accounts. That need not precisely correspond with the accounting reference period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
To avoid the confusion that would result from using the term "financial year " in two slightly different senses, the phrase " accounting reference period" is introduced. The accounting reference period of a company is determined by Clause 2. It will normally be 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted us to examine in this respect the different sizes of companies. That would be a difficult task, for the reasons that I have already indicated—namely, the need to ensure that certain basic requirements are adhered to by all companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked me to quote an example. This is the example that I should like to illustrate for him. I refer to a company whose last accounts were made up to 30th April 1974, laid before an annual general meeting on 31st January 1975, annexed to an annual return, and filed on 28th February 1975. Such a company is required to hold an annual general meetingfor 1976 not later than the end of April. But its next set of accounts is not required to belaid before the company prior to the end of the year. The company is not required to lay any accounts before the annual general meeting in, say, April 1976. It will have no accounts to annex to its annual return for 1976. If the company takes advantage of that provision and lays its accounts before a subsequent general meeting, those accounts will not have to be sent to the Registrar until the next annual return is due, 42 days after the 1977 annual generalmeeting, which does not have to be held until July 1977. The accounts then might not, perfectly lawfully, reach Companies House until mid-September 1977. That is nearly three and a half years—a little longer than I specified—after the start of the period to which they refer. Therefore, the latest accounts available at Companies House right up to September 1977 will be those applicable to the period up to 30th April 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the comments of the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for this opportunity to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will need to study what the Under-Secretary said. We shall need to read his remarks in the OFFICIAL REPORT. It is difficult to catch these matters on the spur of the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
Will the Under-Secretary say what is the comparable situation under the new scheme, and what the comparable situation would be under the scheme put forward by the Conservative accountants? I do not expect him to do so out of the top of his hat, but if he could do so later that will be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly consider that, although I hope that the debate will not be prolonged especially to enable me to accomplish that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn belatedly to the remarks of the hon. Member for Uxbridge, who must have been waiting with bated breath to hear what I have to say. In view of his complimentary remarks to me, it is obvious that the hcn. Gentleman believes that flattery will get him anywhere. I fear that he will be disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that our system would perpetuate the difficulties of small firms. I hope that I have illustrated that that is not the case. He said that small firms would be required to assemble information dangerous to their interests and possibly potentially useful to foreign competitors. Nothing that is proposed here will in any sense add to the burdens of small firms. They may already be required—if they are required, which I doubt—to impart the information about which the hon. Gentleman is worried. We are talking about the accounts. I should have thought that what I had indicated already would have established the point. The lives of small companies will not be made more burdensome. If anything, the situation will be simplified. It will surely be helpful to the community to be in the position which we hope will result from what we propose, where we do not have these massive defaults, and where the system is not brought into disrepute. The present position is dangerous, as it is indicative that the law is not being complied with. That is not helpful. I should have thought that if we could achieve the desired objective both sides of the Committee would have welcomed that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt with the remarks of the hon. Member for Upminster. Regrettably he was not in the Committee, but I fear that that is no reason for my rehearsing the arguments again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier I also dealt with the comments of the hon. Member for mid-Sussex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
I now summarise the situation as we see it. We believe that this clause, coupled with Clauses1 to 7, will seek to remedy the short-comings of the present law by requiring a company to have a fixed accounting reference period, normally of 12 months, which cannot be charged capriciously. Secondly, these provisions will require the directors to prepare accounts in respect of each accounting reference period, to lay those accounts before the company and to file them with the Registrar within a specified time, which the registrar will be able to specify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third piece of this structure is the fact that penalties which may be imposed for failure to file or lay accounts within the prescribed period are to be stiffened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, as I have explained this matter at considerable length that the Committee will feel disposed to move on to the further provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will certainly be most grateful to the Minister for his clear exposition of what is undoubtedly a highly complex matter. There is no partisan appeal in this. We are only concerned to get the right answer. I am sure that that is the desire of both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is a complex matter, I think that we should go into it in somewhat greater depth. t reinforces me in the view--given the case for delaying this legislation until next Session and introducing a more extended Bill—that there might also be a case for doing so on the grounds that this clause and its related clauses need further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Points were also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) about the EEC situation, which the Minister did not touch on in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is that an additional burden is placed on small companies as a result of the change. It may be that the change that is being made is so great, and carries out simplification to such an extent, that they will all shout with joy and say "We are happy to do the extra work in introducing the new system as the burden will be so much lighter". But that is not my impression of the situation that will exist if this Bill is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said for not making a change unless the advantage is substantial. I do not know whether the
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
Government have carried out any experiments, such as a quick sample survey of half a dozen orso small businessmen, to see to what extent—even with the explanatory memorandum whichis said to be in course of preparation, if it is not already prepared—they comprehend what is now proposed. I should be surprised if more than a tiny number of them may manage the change in a short time. However, the diagram which we issued will help them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I indicated that we should be sending out guidance notes in a simplified form, illustrating clearly what new burdens-1 mean new requirements—will be imposed on all those affected by these provisions. I am assured that that will be helpful—it may readily be done—and that these matters are capable of simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spelled out why the matter was made more complex. We must deal with the transitional provisions and the considerations to which I referred earlier. In a sense the diagram is misleading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is so, if only because the small businesses must live through the transitional period. We understand the point which the Minister made. I do not wish to overstate the case. The change will undoubtedly involve small businessmen outside their normal working hours sitting with wet towels round their heads trying to understand the explanatory memorandum. Very often the easiest thing to understand is the actual clause. It is frequently the explanatory memoranda which are sent out which are difficult to understand.

There can be no doubt that the change will involve a burden on small businesses, and it was just a Freudian slip when the Minister described it himself as a "burden". Before this Bill goes through, we must consider very carefully how small businesses will cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Society of Conservative Accountants had not considered certain problems and, in particular, the fact that the previous Conservative legislation on this matter was virtually the same. I think that is overstating the matter. The Conservative accountants have made a good analysis of the two Bills.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0737">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
The Conservative legislation had 120 clauses, this Bill has 35. The annual cost per clause was £833 for the Conservative legislation, and £4,286 for the Labour legislation. So the similarity to which the Minister has drawn attention does seem to have some peculiar financial foibles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have before us certain proposals which are, in my view, certainly more complex than those in the 1973 Bill. Clause 1 is almost twice as long as the equivalent clause in the 1973 Bill. This may be because of complexities which have emerged since then, but I do not accept the broad similarity to which the Minister has drawn attention. The crucial point is whether we can now devise a system which is simpler, and which would involve fewer changes. That is something to which the Society of Conservative Accountants addressed itself in its recommendations with which the Minister will be familiar. The Conservative Accountants have effectively re-written the first 11 clauses of the Bill in some respects, and they have deleted a large number of the clauses involved. They return, basically, to the previous concept of the financial year as defined in Section 455(1) of the Companies Act 1948 which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'financial year' means, in relation to any body corporate, the period in respect of which any profit and loss account of the body corporate laid before it in general meeting is made up, whether that period is a year or not."</p></blockquote>
They then seek to tighten that up by a series of quite simple amendments, compared with the total redraft of the whole thing which is what the Government are proposing in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Accountants specifically suggest the deletion of a number of clauses, and the whole of their proposals, amendments and explanations of them run to the same length as the clause we are now debating. This compares with 11 clauses in the Government's consideration. In view of that, these are proposals we should consider. It did not seem proper for us to put down a totally different set of first 11 clauses in Committee. We thought it better that we should discuss the matter in the clause stand part debate and the Government should consider the situation between now and Report. The Conservative Accountants' proposals are set out in the document which is available for all those who are interested in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the matter is the delay involved under the existing system. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
is no desire on our part to create a situation in which accounts are not laid on the due date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two quite separate animals here. The first is how long any delay under the existingsystem may endure, and the other is whether there are arrears, even under that system. The Minister has addressed himself entirely to the first question—a delay of two or three years under the existing system in the accounts being filed. The Minister says we can have a situation in which 186,000 companies are in arrears. But that relates to the second animal. They are in arrears under the existing system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister agrees. The question is why they are not being chased up on time. The fact that there is a delay is only part of the answer. He is saving that the Department cannot tell when the deadline has passed, and he has not explained why that should be so. Ther may be a case for changing the system so that accounts are presented more quickly, but it is important for the Minister to distinguish between the two separate aspects—whether accounts should be produced more quickly, or whether those responsible for enforcing the system could ensure that they are produced on the due dates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, the Minister has not. He has described the system, but he has not explained why those responsible for administering it cannot chase it up because they do not know what the due date is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is that obviously we must consider how the first animal—the length of time matters can be delayed under the existing system—will compare with the delay under the new system, or alternatively, how it will compare with the proposals put forward by the Conservative accountants. It is choice between three systems—the existing system, the Government's proposals and the Conservative accountants' proposals. I hope that we can have a comparable set of dates for these situations. I am not committed to any of the three systems, but we need to probe them in order to reach a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
judgment of which system is best for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some reservation because I thought I had dealt with all the points except one. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) makes the point repeatedly that Clause 1 is longer than Clause 58 of the 1973 legislation but, in fact, it incorporates some of the points contained in the schedules to the 1973 Bill. There is an advantage from the point of view of legislation in diminishing the extent of the schedules and incorporating them in the main body of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill accounts must be filed within seven months of the end of the period to which they relate, in the case of public companies, and within 10 months in the case of private companies. The periods are fixed and cannot be arbitrarily altered. I would have thought that that was a considerable improvement on the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, as I have indicated, under the present law it is legitimate to delay the filing of accounts. I have illustrated an example. I do not suggest that it is an example followed by a substantial number of companies, but the fact that it can happen should perturb this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unsatisfactory that the Registrar should be left in a position of uncertainty as to whether the annual return filed to him should have the accounts annexed to it. Our proposal willoffer more precision to the position of the Registrar, and it will enable enforcement to takeplace, because under the new regime the Registrar will know when the accounts are due. Then the situation can be computerised and the pursuit procedure made more efficient. The pursuit procedure has been unquestionably improved by computerisation and by the efforts of all those at Companies House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We start with this basic disqualification of uncertainty as regards the Registrar's position. That position will be substantially rectified by the certainty and precision which the new regime offers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it not be covered by annexing a statement of when the last accounts were filed and when the next ones are due?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That is, in itself, a very imprecise state of affairs. I have alreadyindicated when they will be due. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) did not refer to the Stock-dale 	<i>v</i> Coulson case and that is an impediment to successful enforcement procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have looked at the Conservative accountants' proposals but we do not believe that they will achieve the essential objective of fixing the periods to be covered by the accounts. Their analysis is not as helpful or careful as it might have been—I hesitate to say that it is superficial. I do not understand the relevance of cost, clause by clause, compared with the 1973 Bill, and I do not think the hon. Member himself really believed that to be a helpful aside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main complaint about the Conservative accountants' proposals is that, although they are undoubtedly simpler they do not achieve the results we all want to achieve in the Bill. I do not make that point against the Conservative accountants, but we are anxious to arrive at a regime which is helpful to small businesses. The present system is not helpful to them, in fact it stigmatises some of them. It is burdensome and complex, and the new one will be less so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system will provide enforcement procedures with more certainty and a clearer purpose and that, in itself, should commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that the hon. Member has raised these points. I hope that I have managed to clarify some of the alleged anomalies to which he has referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for his reply. I think that we are making progress, and obviously we shall want to study these matters between now and later stages of the Bill in the light of what has been said. I wish to press the Minister further, however, on his two final points. He said that he understood that the proposals put forward by the Conservative accountants were intended to achieve the result which the Government were seeking, but that they did not do so. It would be helpful if he could elaborate upon why he thinks that is so. Our understanding is that to a considerable extent they achieve the objectives which the Government want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
There is a string of dates relating to the present situation. We could probably work out from what the Minister said what the situation is for the new proposals. But what we do not have at the moment is the sequence of events which would follow on the proposals of the Conservative accountants. Perhaps there is some solution between the two extremes but if, as the Minister admits, their proposals are significantly simpler than his we would want to weigh the balance between any difference in timing and the simplicity of the operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should indicate what are considered to be the defects in the Conservative accountants' proposals, and I do that in general rather that specific terms. The real difficulty is that their proposals require accounts to be prepared covering the period starting immediately after the end of the preceding financial year and ending 12 months and six or eight days later. But the accounts would still fall to be annexed to the annual return, and the annexing of the accounts is a problem to which I have referred on a number of occasions. It is a very serious impediment to enforcement, because the Registrar still would not know when the accounts needed to be filed. We say that they should be filed separately from the annual return, and our predecessors also determined that that was correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, almost impossible to work out what would be involved in the Conservative accountants' proposals. They do not hang together with the necessary precision and clarity, butI do not think that it will particularly help the Committee if we pursue this general theme now. The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) rightly said that we could return to it later,and perhaps at some relevant time we can do that. However, I hope that the Committee will now feel it appropriate to make further progress because we have not yet finished Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise simply to express our thanks to the Minister. He has just made a rather omnibus reply. A more detailed answer might have been of greater advantage, but since the first 11 clauses broadly relate to these matters perhaps he will have the opportunity of doing so later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
The choices before us are clear. We leave matters as they are, we go for the Government proposals, or we go for the proposal put forward by the Conservative accountants. We shall consider the possibilities in the light of what the Minister said. I believe that the difficulty about annexing the accounts could be overcome fairly simply, and we would need to lock at that further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Minister for his patience and care. These are important matters which are likely to influence company affairs for many years to come. I am far from sure that thereis a case for rushing the Bill through now, given the immense pressure on Parliamentary time on the Floor of the House. It would be much better if that pressure were directed to the Leader of the House to give us a better Bill next Session after we have had time to mediate on these proposals during the recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise my hon. Friends not to vote against the clause. I believe that either we have to wipe out the first 11 clauses or let the matter go. I believe that for the time being we should let the Bill stand. Of course, we whall try to improve it at later stages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0740">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
large number of companies have the end of their accounting year or reference period at the end of the calendar year. That is unsatisfactory, for a number of reasons. The first is the purely physical one of getting the accountants, the auditors, and everyone else required together at the same time. The second is that the end of the calendar year can be a particularly busy time for companies, coming as it does at the end of the Christmas rush when goods may have been moving at a very fast pace. That causes problems of stocktaking and auditing. The third reason is that over the last few years there has been a tendency for more and more companies to declare a holiday from Christmas through to the New Year, and that can cause trouble, particularly in accounting offices, where there may be a requirement to call in accounting staff and cut across what would otherwise be a holiday for employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are three practical reasons. I can see no specific merit in having 31st December as theaccounting year end, should the company not nominate another date. I can see no merit in the end of the calendar year being preferable to the normally accepted accounting year end to theend of March. For this reason, I suggest that the amendment, which is supported by the Conservatives, should commend itself to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. The trouble about the Bill as presently drafted, specifying as it does the date of 31st December, is that it will impose an excessive rigidityon those companies which do not give notice in accordance with subsection (1) of the date on which they propose their accounting reference period to end. All those companies which fail to give this notice will have imposed upon them the date of 31st December. For the reasons advanced by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) we believe that to be a great mistake. Some companies would normally fail to give this notice in any case. But it is also now clear that 31st December is not the best time of year in which to make up corporate accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many companies now take an extended Christmas holiday stretching through to the New Year. I am delighted that their
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
business conditions permit them to do that, but it means that they find it difficult to have a full staff in at around 29th and 30th December to take stock. That is a complicated business for many companies. Stocktaking at the end of any financial period must be carefully done, and it is difficult to get staff in for this purpose between Christmas and the New Year. The auditors must also be present. Many companies wish them to be so, and it is important that they should be there to verify the stock which goes into the balance sheet at the end of the financial year. Auditors, like other mortals, tend more and more to take holidays between Christmas and the New Year. But if we insist on all companies which fail to notify having their financial years ending on 31st December that will lead to a bottleneck in the accountancy profession and to many more auditors being required to be avaiable in the period around the end of December and thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason I support the amendment is that more and more companies now like to have their accounting reference period tie in as closely as possible with the fiscal year. For that reason, and particularly since the Government make tax more and more complicated, I believe that 31st March should be chosen as the normal date since it fits in most closely with the end of the tax year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see less rigidity in the amendment. It proposes a date in March, but I would like to see as an alternative to its March proposal, the choice of a September year-end. In view of the need to avoid bottlenecks, particularly at the holiday period, it would be better if accounts were made up so that auditors were required steadily throughout the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally a group which has many companies and which has to consolidate accounts, would preferits subsidiaries to make up their accounts at different dates in order to avoid pressure on the head office accounts department. If the hon. Member's amendment therefore specified either31st March or 30th September it would have been preferable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that under subsection (3) the Registrar of Companies has an option to suggest some date other than 31st December to companies which have not notified. Surely however, it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0741">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
better if this flexibility was incorporated in a more effective way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that the accountancy profession has expressed concern that subsection (2) will exaggerate the peak in its annual auditing work-load. This matter was fully discussed in another place. We must however strike a balance between the convenience of the auditing profession, the convenience of the companies themselves, and, to some extent, the convenience of the Registrar, though I do not think that is the most important feature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not been convinced in the discussions we have had that the effect of the provision will result in a significant increase in the number of companies using 31st December as their accounting reference date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Registrar intends to send out notices and reminders about the new arrangements, the effect of which would be to ensure that only a small minority of companies would fail to notify him of the accounting reference date chosen. Of those, many would already be using 31st December, since this is quite clearly the most popular date at present. Those who did not want 31st December would be free to come to an agreement with the Registrar in accordance with subsection (3), or they could alter the date under the provisions of Clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right in asserting that there is a balance of convenience for companies in having theGovernment's proposals rather than the hon. Gentleman's, and there is a balance of convenience for the auditors, we have to elect one way or the other. There is no real issue of principle here. If I were persuaded by the hon. Gentleman that new arguments could be raised in support of the case he seeks to argue, I would be more favourably disposed towards them. But if I am right in saying that on balance the companies prefer this situation as against the auditors, I invite the hon. Gentleman to say where I should jump. I have elected to go in favour of the companies rather than the auditors, because I think that their convenience is paramount. But if it can be established reasonably that I am wrong about that, of course I shall look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that December is the most popular date, by which I assume he means that it is the date when most of the work is done. Presumably, those who are hit by this part of the clause are those who have not felt so strongly that they wished to opt for some other date. Is not there a case for spreading the work around so that the Registrar in turn gets it on a more evenly distributed basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is the view of the Registrar, and it does not appear to be the view of those who purport to represent small companies. The people who have made their decision demonstrably clear are the auditors. One can see the situation there. I hope thatwhat I have said about the way in which the Registrar can approach the matter, and the companies can approach it, will avoid some of the more Draconian penalties which seemed to be enlivening the speech of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is excessive rigidity about this. The date can be changed under Clause 3 or Clause 2(3). Clause 2(3) was not, of course, originally in the 1973 Bill. That will probably harden the opposition to me now from the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). We tried specifically to facilitate a change in date by a company to which 31st December has been allocated, and the initiative will be taken by the company in this respect and not by the Registrar. A company is free to choose its own date. Most companies seem to choose 31st December at the moment. This is why we chose that date, because it seemed to facilitate the choice of the maximum number of companies. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to introduce additional arguments to persuade me to a different view, I shall certainly be receptive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his fairly flexible approach and his willingness to listen to further argument. I have two further points which have grown out of the discussion. The first is that the interests concerned in this matter are not solely those of the employees of the company, the auditors and the Registrar. There is also the interest of the general public in this question. That is tied in through the activities of the auditors in this sort of situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
We have heard from other hon. Members of the position at stock-taking at the end of the financial year—in this case 31st December—when it is desirable for auditors to be present. I believe that that desirability ought to be a mandatory requirement, because this is such an important facet of any accountancy situation. Anyone involved in stocktaking and accounting will know that this is the one point at which discrepancies can very easily be perpetrated if people are so minded. I am not saying that there is a large number of such companies, but it is vitally important that the stock-taking figures are accurate and are seen to be accurate, and that the interest of the general public is protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with great interest. I very muchagree with what he says about the importance of auditors being present at stock-taking. Thisis a strong argument for moving the termination date from 31st December to 31st March. But will not the hon. Gentleman agree that in most cases a good firm of accountants would insist on being present for audit purposes at the annual stocktaking and would not be happy to sign theaccounts unless the auditors had been present, even if this were not mandatory in law? Further, under the present beneficial tax treatment of stock, it is that much more important that the auditors be present at stock-taking, in that in the treatment of stock can lie all the difference between profit and loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is absolutely right in drawing attention to the vital aspect of the evaluation of stock, and to the fact that most reputable auditors would insist on this requirement. But if the auditors are under pressure from alarge number of companies at the same time, all requiring their presence, it may make the difference between one auditor and a team of auditors being present at the stock-taking. I have seen this myself. The strength of audit representation at stock-taking sometimes may have to be diluted because of the pressures on the firm. These pressures are very real and understandable, and can to some extent reduce the supervision at the time of audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's earlier point that there is room for a greater flexibility thansimply having 31st March as an alternative. There is a need to move away from 31st December, for good and valid reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that companies have a choice as to date, and pointed out that a large number of companies have 31st December by their own choice. I accept this entirely, but there has been a trend over recent years for 31st December to become more difficult because of the growing popularity of holidays at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, it is a fact that it is not easy for companies to change their accounting year. A growing number of companies still have their accounting year to 31st December and are becoming more and more unhappy with it. They may not yet have got to the point of changing their accounting year, with all the trouble this entails, but if they were starting from scratch they might well not choose 31st December. The system should be geared, as I have indicated, to moving away from 31st December. I think this is a valid point technically, and the Government would do well to go along with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respond to the hon. Gentleman's additional point by saying that my mind is not closed to this. I feel that it would be helpful to the Committee if we did not make a judgment on the matter here today, and all reflected further on it, and perhaps had the benefit of a clearer analysis of the points the hon. Gentleman has made. If he is right in saying that there is a trend against 31st December, and in saying that more and more companies are unhappy about having elected to use that date, the assumption upon which my case rests is somewhat fragile. If, on the other hand, we were able to obtain an analysis which indicated the contrary, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would be the first to agree that perhaps the basic assumption on which his case is based would appear to be somewhat fragile—subject always to the overriding convenience, in his case, of the auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, therefore, that we come back to this at a later stage. It will give us an opportunity to explain or to discuss the matter with some constructive effect outside the Committee between now and Report stage.

I indicated at the outset that I have no very hard and fast rules governing my thinking on this. I want to do what will be best for the companies and, let us hope, best for the companies and auditors combined.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we covered a number of points of principle underlying this clause in the debate on Clause 1, I can be quite brief. As I have already pointed out, the first 11 clauses hang together. I refer specifically to a passage at the end of page 3 and the beginning of page 4, but for convenience it might be better for me to start at the beginning of the clause. Clause 2(1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any company may give notice in the prescribed form to the registrar of companies specifying a date in the calendar year as being the date on which in each successive calendar year an accounting reference period of the company is to be treated as coming to an end".</p></blockquote>
So far so good. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but no such notice shall have effect unless it is given before the date on which section 1 above comes into operation or before the end of the period of six months beginning with the date of the incorporation of the company".</p></blockquote>
Leaving on one side the part dealing with the incorporation of the company—that is obviously concerned with companies which are beginning to be incorporated—it seems a little tight to suggest that, if companies are to have the option of selecting their own date, they must give notice before Clause 1 comes into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the problems of communications and the problems of people understanding
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
the changes which are made, I wonder whether that is not rather too tight, and whether one could not leave a little option in it. I say this not least because on the point we have just been discussing, it may be that if companies do not do it in time they will all end up with whatever date we eventually agree upon, and therefore there may be peaks in business which are perhaps undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is whether the clause is necessary. As the Minister will know, the Conservative accountants suggested that it could be deleted without any great loss. That relies on our changing the whole basis. I would not therefore, wish to press that. As I have already indicated, we would want to return to that alternative at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I entirely followed the hon. Gentleman's comments. I am afraid that my attention was distracted by something as he spoke. That is the penalty that overtakes many of us in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the effective functioning of the system is that the Registrar must be aware of the date on which every company's accounting reference period ends, and the system cannot fully come into operation until this information is available. This clause will come into effect some months before Clause 1. It is intended that the Registrar will circulate well in advance a notice to all companies drawing their attention to the need to notify him of their accounting reference period. He will also ensure that those who do not reply will be followed up. However, I do not think it would be right to delete this clause, which we regard as an absolutely essential criterion for the effective functioning of the system. I would not have thought that this was really in the mind of the hon. Gentleman either. I know that he talks about recasting the system, but even so if we recast it—this is not a subject I would want to prolong in debate this morning—is an attempt to remove some degree of uncertainty there would be a very real and positive danger which I would not have thought that the hon. Gentleman would wish to embrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I just pursue the first point? On the second point I made I evidently did not make myself clear.

	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
What I said was that, if one were to adopt a quite different system, namely, the first alternative we were considering earlier on Clause 1, it would be true to say that this clause would then become irrelevant and could be deleted. I do not want to pursue this point at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, I see that in Clause 35 the date on which the Act comes into operation is specified. As is normal it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Act shall come into operation on such date as may be specified by the Secretary of State by order … and different dates may be so specified for different provisions and for different purposes."</p></blockquote>
I presume that the Government have had in mind that Clauses 1 and 2 will come into operation at the same time. Perhaps that is not so and I have misunderstood it. It would be helpful to have it clarified. What we are saying is that the option must be exercised by the company before Clause 1 comes into operation. However, if the Minister has in mind some idea of when the various bits will come into operation I think that it would be helpful to know that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it was envisaged that Clause 2 would precede Clause 1 by several months and that it therefore followed that the Registrar would be writing to companies to invite them to give him the date and that he would ensure that those which did not reply werefollowed up.

These are formal drafting Amendments. They provide that subsections (3) and (4) of Clause should be subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b).

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a slight difficulty in understanding the reasoning that lies behind Clause 3. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some further explanation of the Department's thinking when he replies to this debate. In brief, as I see it, the effect of this clause is that a company has the opportunity once every five years to extend its accounting reference period up to a period of 18 months. This can be done every five years under the provision of subsection (7) (b), unless the company is either a subsidiary of a holding company or a holding company, in which case its right to extend its accounting reference period up to a period of 18 months can happen whenever the subsidiary or holding company wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about the second stage of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will think it unusual for me, who has been asking for further rights and for further exemptions for companies in the general course of this Bill, to say that in this case the Government may have gone slightly too far. Is there not a danger under subsection (3) that a company that is a subsidiary or holding company of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
another company could regularly extend its accounting reference period up to 18 months? This by definition would be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking particularly of the situation where a holding company wishes to delay filing its accounts or the production of those accounts and then their filing, rather adopting the situation that the Under-Secretary outlined this morning, and the great delays that happen at present. Is there not a danger that a holding company will have many subsidiary companies all of which, or a number of which, could have different financial year ends? The holding company could, therefore, be in a position of regularly changing round, using the powers given to it under subsection (3) so that time and again its accounting reference period would run for 18 months rather than the normal year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is—it seems to me to be so—a possibility under subsection (3), which is then picked up again under subsection (7) (c), I think it is a mistake. I think that the principle we would want to stick to is that normally accounts are filed every 12 months. It is right that a holding company should periodically be able to change its financial year end in order to fit in with a subsidiary company, or, more particularly, that a subsidiary company should be allowed to change its financial year end to fit in with a holding company situation, but it is clearly not desirable for a holding company to be able to use subsection (3) as a device in any shape or form. I fear that as drafted at present it might do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving time to the Minister to get advice on that point. I have one further comment about the clause. I feel once again that it is extraordinarily tortuously drafted. I refer particularlyto subsections (5) and (10). Subsection (10) in my view reads like a clause that Alice might have tried to read once she had gone through the looking glass and found great difficulty in understanding it. I find it hard to understand. I am sure many people who read it will findithard to understand as well. I suggest to the Minister that if this clause can be tidied up before Report he would be doing a service to every company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is based on Clause 62.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I heard the Minister say Clause 62. That is no excuse for it being hard to understand, and I find it hard to understand. t is poorly drafted and hard to read. There is a case here for clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Trade said 	<i>sotto voce,</i> this clause is based upon Clause 62 of the 1973 Bill. I agree with the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) that it is no excuse for bad draftsmanship. I am sure that, if the clause can be made clearer, it will be, and I undertake to look at that, but I cannot give any commitment. However, I accept that it is a complicated clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman commented during an earlier speech that I had nodded in apparent agreement with a remark he was making about the accounting reference period being somewhat complicated. I did nod, but to be honest I find all company law extremely complicated. It was my misfortune to have to read it for the Bar examinations and I immediately shelved any further interest in it until I was put on this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is correct in his reading of the Clause. I will explain it very briefly, although he has in substance got it right already. The limitations on a company's freedom to change its accounting reference period, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, are intended solely to prevent abuses and, in particular, to prevent a company from using alterations in accounting reference periods as a means of delaying the laying and filing of its accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman says, the limitations imposed by this clause are as follows. Firstly, an accounting reference period which has already ended cannot be extended 	<i>ex post facto</i> except for the purpose of aligning the accounting reference period of a holding company and its subsidiary. The hon. Gentleman was correct in that. Secondly, an accounting reference period cannot be extended to a period exceeding 18 months. The hon. Gentleman was correct in that. Thirdly, a company's accounting reference period may not be extended more than once in any five-year period, except for the purpose of aligning the accounting reference periods of a holding company and its subsidiary unless the Secretary of State gives special permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
It is true that the clause allows changes in accounting reference periods subject to those safeguards and those limitations. It is true also that there is a special provision for a holding company with a subsidiary, and, I may add, that this was added in the other place, in response to pressure from the Opposition. So the subsection to which the hon. Gentleman feels might give rise to some abuse was added in the other place and pressed for by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation the hon. Gentleman envisages are theoretically possible and it would be useless for me to say that it was not. I think he will accept that it is pretty unlikely, if not widely unlikely, and certainly the shareholders and auditors in such a situation would want to know something about why it was happening and have something to say about it. I hope that will answer his query and I hope that it will give an explanation to the hon. Gentleman of why safeguards and limitations are necessary in Clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that explanation. There are still two questions in my mind. Perhaps he would like to comment on them briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firstly, following on the helpful clarification and exposition of this clause that he gave us, his comment that even in an 	<i>ex post facto</i> situation a subsidiary company of a holding company or a holding company can change its accounting reference periods—that is, after the accounting reference period has ended—is he totally happy about that situation? It seems to me that there is a possibility that this could lead to abuse, because clearly there could be a situation in which, to put it plainly, a company had had a very bad year. The company might foresee an upturn in its fortunes in the months ahead and might therefore wish to conceal the fact from the shareholders that it had had a bad 12 months. Therefore it would apply for a continuation of its accounting reference period for, say, another six months. That is a maximum period available to it to bring in the fruits of the two contracts that it would have completed in that time. If it was a major group, it is almost certain that it would find a subsidiary company within its ambit with a different financial year and date. Therefore, it would be able
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
to use that as the excuse for extending its accounting reference period. I find that the whole of this ability to change the accounting reference period 	<i>ex post facto</i> after it has ended is an area of concern. I should like to know whether the Minister is satisfied with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to the subsidiary or holding company point, at the risk of marginally disagreeing with what was said in another place on this issue, it would seem to me perfectly reasonable for a subsidiary company within the holding company to change its date within the holding company structure and to marry it to the holding company's financial year. The holding company might wish periodically to change different subsidiaries' dates to meet that need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the holding company took over another group, it might decide not to change all the subsidiaries' dates at the same time. It might prefer to do so 	<i>seriatim.</i> I do not like the concept of a holding company having the regular option to extend or change its accounting reference period to bring it into line with those of its subsidiaries. That does not seem to be following nature. That seems to be the tail wagging the dog. If a holding company did that too often we might slightly suspect that it was doing so for purposes that might not be entirely open—that it might wish to conceal something or hold up the production of its accounts for some reason. Perhaps the Minister could give us some minor further clarification on those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman was generous enough to ask for clarification of minor points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of being repetitive, I must point out that as drafted the clause allows alterations to be made only to the current accounting reference period. It does not permit retrospective alteration of a previous period under any circumstances. During the debates in the other place it was suggested that this was unduly restrictive and that retrospective alteration should be permitted for the purpose of aligning the financial years of a subsidiary company and its holding company. The Government accepted that view. The clause has now been amended to permit a company to alter its accounting period
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
retrospectively for that purpose provided that such notice of alteration is given before the period of laying and altering accounts has elapsed. I am satisfied that there is no real prospect of significant abuse. Perhaps that answers the hon. Gentleman's points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Groups are normally required to align their financial years without delay. There are not therefore, likely to be many subsidiaries with different dates that could be made use of in that way. I do not think that I can answer the point better than that. I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I am sure that it will be considered carefully. The matter was debated in the other place. As a result of pressure by the Opposition there—I do not say that it was wrong—this special concession was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not follow that point. I shall try to quote accurately what the Minister said. I believe he said that there were unlikely to be many subsidiaries with different accounting dates. I should have thought that in many major groups—especiallyin the event of a takeover by one group from another—there were many subsidiaries withdifferent accounting dates and financial years. Often this is a matter of history. There are different customs in different trades. I wonder on what basis the Minister made that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we must consider the point. The hon. Gentleman has a view. I have expressed a view. I shall consider the point and perhaps come back to it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Crawshaw, suggested that we should take a number of other amendments, with Amendment No. 102, which contain similar figures. They arise on subsequent clauses Nos. 8, 12, 21 and 22. I think that it may be convenient to discuss the matter in the general terms that you suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The penalties which are now suggested by the Government, and the offences which attract the penalties, vary depending on which clause we are considering. I understanding that you, Mr. Crawshaw, would like us to debate all of them at this point. Therefore, I shall do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I raised the question of the penalties in Clause 4. On 19th May I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Again, particularly in the context of small companies, which may have difficulties in producing accounts for various reasons, the penalties seem to be heavy."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary intervened and said "They are maxima"—to which I replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They may be maxima, but £400 and £40 per day is a hefty penalty."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th May 1976; Vol. 911, c. 1653.]</p></blockquote>
I do not think that that can be disputed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I address my remarks to Amendment No. 102, which is related to Clause 4. It contains penalties for not complinyg with Clause 1 in the period allowed for the laying and delivery of accounts. We have carefully considered Clause 1. The clause deals with the penalties which are imposed on those who do not deliver their accounts in accordance with the Governments new timetable. We are desirous that accounts should be produced on time. Therefore, there is a case for imposing a penalty. The question arises of what is an appropriate penalty in the circumstances where the accounts are not delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again I stress strongly that this is a case for distinguishing between the size of companies. It may well be that the ordinary company or the large multinational company has no problem in producing its accounts on time. Indeed, it would probably be very exceptional for such companies not do do so, for the simple reason that they enjoy economies
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
of scale. If one of their accountants is sick or on holiday, someone else may take over. The same is not true of the small company, where the individual concerned may produce his own accounts as well as run every aspect of his business. Therefore, there is yet again a case for distinguishing between the penalties that are imposed. I therefore suggest to the Minister that, if in no other area, this is one where he may consider that the position of small companies, however defined, should be given different treatment from that which is extended to the large company with many people conducting its accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 suggests that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"every person who immediately before the end of the last-mentioned period was a director of the company shall, in respect of each of those subsections which is not so complied with, be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding the aggregate of £400 and an additional £40 for each day which falls"</p></blockquote>
within certain specified periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point to be noted is that these penalties apply to the director in respect of cach of those subsections which were not complied with. We know from our discussion earlier on Clause 1 that there are a number of different subsections. Therefore, there is a series of penalties. The mere failure to provide accounts on a due date leads to a series of offences. The sums involved are clearly substantial to the individual—I stress, the individual, not the company. The individual is liable on summary conviction to a fine comprising both a lump sum of £400 and an additional £40 for each day outside the period allowed for laying and delivering the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may clearly amount to a substantial sum. In the case of small companies it may well be far in excess of the profit made for the year. In some cases it may even comprise the sum of the profits made over five years. If it is suggested that that is an appropriate penalty, I think that it requires careful consideration. We suggest that the figure be altered to £200 plus £20 per day. Even those sums may well be far too high. We put them down as a basis for discussion. We hope—I trust that T have the attention of the Minister—that that will be considered carefully by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
I am not sure what is the origin of the penalty. Indeed, I am not sure what are the existing penalties. I hope that the Minister will make clear what are the existing penalties and how they varied in the period before the 1968 legislation, in which there was a differentiation between categories of company. At all events I think that those sums were large. These penalties are separate from the penalties which apply under Clause 4(3), which relate to the position of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that when speaking to the amendment because of the need for the penalties to be taken together. In the case of the small company, the two may indeed be one and the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 4(3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the company shall be liable to a penalty (recoverable in civil proceedings by the Secretary of State)"</p></blockquote>
of an amount calculated in accordance with Clause 4(4), which details the figures. Alternatively, the fine is £450, whichever is the less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider whether the figures which we seek to amend tie in properly with those figures for the company, which may be a maximum of £450, if I have understood the position correctly. No doubt the Minister will confirm whether that is so. That is another aspect to which we may return on "clause stand part".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall picture is undoubtedly one of heavy penal sanctions. We are not in favour of companies failing to produce their accounts on time. We deplore the present situation whereby a number of companies have not done so. But these penalties seem to be heavy. We therefore hope that we can persuade the Government that they are not appropriate. They may indeed not even be appropriate for the directors of large public companies. However, it is the position of the small company which gives us a special cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a penalty to be imposed on the individual. In a large company the individual may not be immediately concerned with these matters. We should appreciate the Government's views on these two matters. We think that we may be able to persuade the Government to change their minds on this subject. Whether we may carry the hon. Gentleman in the previous Committee he was always referred to as "the hon. Member for 	<i>Private Eye";</i> I do not know how he is referred to in

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the other related amendments. I refer to Amendments Nos. 104, 105. 107 and 108 which relate respectively to Clause 8, Clause 12, Clause 21 and Clause 22.
