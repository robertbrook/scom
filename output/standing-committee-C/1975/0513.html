	<p>'(1) Subject to the following subsections, and to section 168 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 every bankrupt who shall not already have obtained his discharge shall be automatically discharged five years after the court has ordered his public examination to be concluded; provided that no bankrupt shall be discharged from the later while undischarged from an earlier bankruptcy.
	<ol>
	<li>The court may enter a caveat in the prescribed form against the bankrupt's discharge from bankruptcy—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>on the adjournment for closing of the public examination of the bankrupt, either on its own motion, or on the application of the official receiver, or trustee, or any creditor who has proved; or</li>
	<li>at any time during the aforesaid period of two years, on the applicatiop of the official receiver or trustee, and on notice to and after hearing the bankrupt if he desires to be heard.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Where a caveat is entered subsection (1) of this section shall be inapplicable.</li>
	<li>A bankrupt may, at any time after being adjudged bankrupt, apply to the court for an order of discharge, and the court shall appoint a day after his public examination is concluded for hearing the application. The application shall, except when the court otherwise directs, be heard in open court.</li>
	<li>On the hearing of the application the court shall take into consideration a report of the official receiver as to the bankrupts conduct and affairs including a report as to the bankrupt's conduct during the proceedings.</li>
	<li>Where—
	<ol>
	<li>the bankrupt has committed any criminal offence connected with his bankruptcy; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt's assets are not equal to at least one half of the amount of his unsecured liabilities and he does not satisfy the court that he cannot justly be held responsible for this fact; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has within the three years immediately preceding the commencement of his bankruptcy failed to keep such books of account as are usual and proper in his business and as sufficiently disclose his business transactions and financial position; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has without consulting his creditors continued to carry on a trade or business after he knew or should have known himself to be insolvent; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has contracted any provable debt without having at the time of contracting it a reasonable expectation (proof whereof shall lie on him) that he would be able to pay it; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has failed to account satisfactorily for any loss or deficiency of assets; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has contributed to his bankruptcy by any rash or hazardous speculation, by unjustifiable extravagance, by gambling, or by culpable neglect of this affairs; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has contributed to his bankruptcy by bringing any frivolous or vexatious legat proceeding or by any frivolous or vexatious defence to any legal proceeding properly brought against him; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has, after or within three months before, the date of the petition (being insolvent) voluntarily preferred any one or more of his creditors; or</li>
	<li>the bankrupt has, after, or within three months before, the date of the petition, incurred liabilities with a view of making his assets equal to one-half the amount of his unsecured liabilities; or</li>

</ol>
the court shall either—
	<ol>
	<li>refuse the discharge; or</li>

	<li>A discharged bankrupt shall, notwithstanding his discharge, give such assistance as the trustee may reasonably require in the realisation of such of his property as is vested in the trustee, and, if he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of a contempt of court; and the court may also revoke his discharge, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition or payment duly made or thing duly done subsequent to the discharge but before its revocation.</li>
	<li>The entry of a caveat under subsection (2) hereof shall be appealable by the bankrupt but a refusal to enter a caveat shall be appealable only by the official receiver.</li>

	<p>	<i>Amendment</i> (	<i>a</i>) to New Clause 3, in line 11, leave out 'two' and insert 'five'.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 51, in schedule 3, page 14, line 4, third column, at beginning insert Sections 26 and 27'.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the last sitting I was anxious to put on record, for the benefit both of the Opposition and of people outside the House who are interested in the Bill, the Government's thinking about the issues contained essentially in New Clause 4. It may be helpful, particularly in view of the motion which I propose to move later—which will enable the Committee to stand adjourned so that further consultation can take place with the Opposition and the professional bodies—if I were to enlarge upon what I said last time and cover some of the other matters which we are considering in this group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having stated the purpose of New Clause 4 and having gone through the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
various subsections, may I turn to the question of the automatic review procedure which is essentially set out in Clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point I want to make is that this procedure is additional to the existing procedure for discharge. Therefore, before the five years has expired from the date of the order of adjucation, the bankrupt will still be able to apply for his discharge under the existing procedure. It follows that, where the court has made an order under new Clause 4, that is to say for absolute discharge on the fifth anniversary of the order of adjucation, unless the order is subsequently rescinded it will be necessary to provide for a review for the purpose of discharge. Hence we have Amendment No. 52 about which I need say nothing more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 6, the Official Receiver will be obliged to apply to the court to review an order of adjucation for the purpose of discharge within 12 months after the fifth anniversary of the date of the order. At present, something like one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>265</span>
in three bankrupts apply for discharge. Therefore, on average, two-thirds of all the orders of adjucation made in any one year will fall to be reviewed within the appropriate 12-month period. The court will have to fix a day for hearing the application to review, and a notice will have to be given only to the bankrupt not less than 14 days before the hearing. n that regard the situation will be somewhat different from the application for discharge where a notice has to be sent to the creditors, although I would add in parentheses that in such cases—that is to say, applications for discharge—the creditor is constrained in his opposition because he is limited to the grounds set out in the Official Receiver's report, unless the creditor has given notice in writing that he wishes to enlarge upon that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of review after five years we thought it unlikely that creditors would have grounds of opposition additional to those of which the Official Receiver would be aware and which would therefore be included in his report. So we took the view that the expense of sending out notices to creditors was, in those circumstances, without justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court will also be obliged under Clause 6(4) to take into consideration on the application for review, the Official Receiver's report on the bankrupt's conduct and affairs. As is the case in existing law, the report represents 	<i>prima facie</i> evidence of the statements contained in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other important feature of Clause 6(5) is that the court will be able to hear an application to review, even in the absence of the bankrupt. The reason for that is not to cause any injustice. The situation that is likely to arise in a number of cases is that the bankrupt may simply elect not to attend the hearing because the application is to be made by the Official Receiver. The bankrupt will, of course, receive notice, but he may decide not to attend. Our intention is that all bankruptcies coming within the scope of Clause 6 should be reviewed, and therefore this provision is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers provided by subsection (6) are different from those which the court now has when dealing with an application for discharge. Under Section 26 of the 1914 Act, the court has the general power to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge or suspend the operation of the order for a specified time or grant an order of discharge".</p></blockquote>
subject to conditions, relating perhaps to after-acquired earnings, or income for profit. If the bankrupt committed a misdemeanour in relation to his bankruptcy or any of the " facts " under Section 26 are found proved, the court must refuse a discharge or suspend for such time as it thinks appropriate, or until a dividend of at least 50p in the pound is paid to creditors, or require that the bankrupt, as a condition of discharge, consents to judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new provisions on the application for review the court's power will be the same for all bankruptcies. Consequently, it may grant or refuse an absolute order for discharge. It may suspend for such a period as it thinks fit, or until a dividend of 50p in the pound is paid to creditors, or it may require the bankrupt to consent to judgment as a condition of discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore the court will be able to grant an absolute order of discharge in any case, if it thinks it appropriate so to do. But it will have no power to attach conditions other than those under the second and third points which I have just made—that is to say, suspending for such period as the court thinks fit, which will be when a dividend of 50p in the pound is paid to creditors, or requiring the bankrupt to consent to judgment as a condition of discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor will the court have power to impose different conditions concurrently as under the existing law. These limitations are necessary in the case of application to review, since five years will have elapsed since the order of a judication will have been made. The bankrupt is not making the application. The review is being undertaken automatically and will often be heard in the absence of the bankrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, ar far as this aspect of the matter is concerned, the new provisions would enable some of the burden that now falls upon the judges to be eased by empowering registrars to hear all applications for review, whether or not they are opposed. Of course, at present only a judge may hear the opposed applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Opposition's New Clause 3, which provides for automatic discharge five years after the conclusion of the public examination, unless the bankrupt has already obtained his discharge, or remains
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
undischarged from an earlier bankruptcy, or the court has entered a 	<i>caveat</i> preventing automatic discharge from becoming effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, this seeks in most material respects to follow the Blagden Committee representations, save that Blagden spoke of two years and the Opposition amendment refers to five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that position the Opposition have tabled another amendment to remedy a defect which appeared in their earlier proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered very carefully what Blagden had to say. n a review of the position leading up to a Bill of this kind it is important that not only my officials and those outside the House who are interested in the matter, but also the Opposition, should pay due regard to an important report of this kind. But we should have regard to some of the practical difficulties which may not have emerged in the debate outside the House thus far. There would be immensely difficult decisions confronting both the Official Receiver and the court about whether to make application for a 	<i>caveat</i> on the one hand, or the court should enter the 	<i>caveat</i> on the other. The amendment provides that a 	<i>caveat</i> may be applied for or entered either on the adjournment for the closing of the public examination or at any time during the five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal first with the situation on the adjournment for the closing of the public examination. At that point, the only evidence that will be before the court is that which will have been given orally at the public examination, whereas on a normal application for discharge the evidence is summarised by the Official Receiver in his report. When one has regard to the sort of case that might be expected to arise, in which the public examination will still be held following the power to dispense under Clause 5, it is unlikely that either the Official Receiver or the court could decide this issue on the oral evidence. I think that it would be necessary for the public examination transcript to be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be necessary for the Official Receiver, because he would have to determine whether to apply for the entry of the 	<i>caveat</i> It would be equally important for the court, in determining whether a 	<i>caveat</i> should be entered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How could the court predict, in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
more difficult cases, what it might wish to do five years ahead? How could the Official Receiver predict what the court might do in such circumstances? The Official Receiver, because he entertained some doubts about the matter, might feel driven to make an application. n those circumstances, is it not almost certain that the application would be faced with an appeal against it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In nearly every case the Official Receiver would have to wait for the transcript of the public examination and then prepare a report before deciding whether to apply for the 	<i>caveat</i> to be entered. He would be required to give notice to the debtor, who would probably oppose the application, and a full court hearing would follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, the Official Receiver decided that he did not wish to apply for a 	<i>caveat,</i> is it not right that creditors might feel that they should be entitled to challenge that decision? Would that not result in another court hearing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also provides for a creditor who has proof to apply at the stage about which I am talking for a 	<i>caveat</i> to be entered, even though the Official Receiver or the court would hardly be in a position to decide on the issue of the 	<i>caveat.</i> That might well represent a charter for vindictive creditors. In these circumstances the court would have virtually no alternative but to adjourn for the transcript to become available and the Official Receiver's report to be prepared. Therefore the burden on the Official Receiver and the court would be substantially increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The automatic discharge procedure, as set out in the amendment, is likely therefore to be more cumbersome, time-consuming and costly than the review procedure which we have set out in Clause 6. The same purposes can be achieved under New Clause 4 without the disadvantages of New Clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The differences between the two are fundamentally these. First, although the court is given a power in New Clause 4, when making an order including the public examination or dispensing with it, to order also that the bankrupt be given an absolute discharge on the fifth anniversary of the order of adjudication, there is no burden placed on the Official Receiver. The advice I have been given in this respect is probably right. It is a burden
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
that should not have to be borne by the Official Receiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, under New Clause 4 it is likely that the court would make an order for automatic discharge only when there is no evidence of gross misconduct, that is to say in the more straightforward cases. That represents a much simpler task than that imposed under New Clause 3, which requires the court to decide on detailed and lengthy oral evidence whether the 	<i>caveat</i> should be entered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, under New Clause 3 where the 	<i>caveat</i> is entered, the bankrupt is essentially left to his own resources, since the only way in which he then will be able to procure his discharge is to apply under New Clause 3, replacing Section 26 of the 1914 Act. If he fails to apply, he remains a bankrupt. Therefore there is the same old problem, to which I have referred earlier in the debate, of the standing population of undischarged bankrupts. This would perhaps be a prolongation of that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 6 and New Clause 4 every bankruptcy will be reviewed if no automatic discharge is granted or the order of adjudication is not otherwise disposed of. That sets out our case in relation to the substance of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have tabled a number of amendments to New Clause 4. It would be helpful if I put on the record the Government's view of them. I feel, however, that I would wish to have a further look at the points that are made, because the amendments appeared rather late in the day. I blame nobody for this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (	<i>a</i>) to New Clause 4 would have the effect of requiring a court, when considering whether to make an order directing that the bankrupt shall have an absolute discharge on the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication, as is provided for in New Clause 4, to have particular regard to the answers given by the debtor at his public examination instead of having particular regard to the criteria which have been provided in the amendment to New Clause 4, namely any facts stated in Section 26(3) of the 1914 Act or whether the bankrupt has committed any offence under that Act or any other events connected with his bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also make it mandatory for the court—instead of providing it with a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
discretion as we do under the amendment to New Clause 4—when it makes an order dispensing with the debtor's public examination, to make an order directing that the bankrupt should have an absolute discharge on the fifth anniversary of the date of his adjudication providing that the requirements of subsection (2) have been complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (	<i>b</i>) to New Clause 4 would have the effect of requiring the court at the time it makes an order concluding public examination or an order dispensing with it—when it is considering whether to make an order directing that the bankrupt shall have an absolute discharge under the provisions of amendment to New Clause 4—to have particular regard to the answers given by the debtor at his public examination or in the report of the Official Receiver on the bankrupt's conduct and affairs in cases where the public examination has been dispensed with, instead of having particular regard to the two criteria provided in New Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms introduced by the amendments could be said to lack the degree of precision of the two criteria which are laid down in New Clause 4. They might lead to a state of uncertainty and increase the variation of treatment of similar cases by different courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not make too much of these points, because something might also be said along the same lines about the terms set out in New Clause 4. I do not think there is any essential difference between the two propositions in practice. I cannot see any reason, although I shall wait to hear from the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) when we are discussing this later, why his solution and his form of words should be preferred to those which appear in New Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the court makes an order dispensing with the public examination under the provisions of Clause 5, it is very probable that it would also make an order directing that the bankrupt be automatically discharged under New Clause 4. I think it would be undesirable to make this latter order mandatory as is provided in Amendment (	<i>a</i>)to New Clause 4, in other words to remove every possible discretion from the court, even if the situation is an improbable one in practice. The public examination may have been dispensed with under the existing provisions of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>271</span>
Section 15(10) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 because the debtor was unfit to attend. The circumstances of the case, however, may be such that an order directing automatic discharge might be inappropriate and I would ask the Opposition to take that point into account in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment(	<i>b</i>) to New Clause 4, insofar as it provides for the court to have particular regard to the report of the Official Receiver about the bankrupt's conduct of affairs in cases where the public examination has been dispensed with, is unnecessary, except in cases where the order to dispense has been made on the application of a friend or relative of the bankrupt on the ground that he is unfit to attend. n all other cases the Official Receiver will already have filed such a report for the purposes of his application to dispense with the public examination. All the relevant circumstances of the case to which the court will have to have regard will be included in his report. I would add 	<i>in</i> this respect that it may help the Committee to know that it is intended that the rules will be amended to provide for the making of such a report and for it to be prima facie evidence of the statements which are contained in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (	<i>c</i>) to New Clause 4 would have the effect of preventing an order made by the court directing that the bankrupt be absolutely discharged on the fifth anniversary of the date of adjudication from becoming operative if the bankrupt has applied for his discharge before the fifth anniversary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the provisions of New Clause 4 the longest time that a bankrupt is able to remain undischarged, once the court has made an order directing that he be given an automatic discharge and that order has not been rescinded, is five years. He can, of course, obtain his discharge earlier if he applies for it and is granted it under Section 26 of the Bankruptcy Act. But if he applies for his discharge and the court refuses the discharge or suspends it for such time as would extend beyond five years—these are both somewhat unlikely events—the order for automatic discharge would still operate and the discharge would still be effective on the fifth anniversary of the date of the adjudication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment it would be possible for the bankrupt, notwithstanding the fact that an order may have been made directing that he be given an automatic
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
discharge, to remain undischarged for longer than five years indeed, even for life, because if he applies for his discharge during the five years an automatic discharge order ceases to operate. Accordingly, if on the bankrupt's application under Section 26, the court suspends the discharge—so that it does not become absolute until after the five years have expired—the bankrupt would remain undischarged for that extra time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if the court, on the bankrupt's application, refuses the discharge, he would form part of this new standing population of undischarged bankrupts to which I referred earlier in another context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is unlikely that the court would, on a bankrupt's application under Section 26, either refuse the discharge or suspend it beyond the five-year period in cases where an order had earlier been made directing that the bankrupt be automatically discharged, the amendment is unlikely in practice to have any real effect. In all other cases—that is to say, where the bankrupt applies for and is granted earlier discharge than he would have had under the order for automatic discharge, the effect is the same as under new Clause 4 and this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the penultimate amendment in this group—Amendment (	<i>d</i>) to new Clause 4—which would have the effect of restricting the category of persons who have been adjudged bankrupt more than five years before the coming into force of the clause not having had the adjudication now—and who would be granted an absolute discharge on the relevant date, that is the coming into force of the clause or the tenth anniversary of the date of adjudication, whichever is the later. The group is composed of bankrupts who have not applied for discharge before the relevant date; bankrupts who have applied for and were granted an absolute discharge; and bankrupts who have applied for and were granted the conditional order of discharge providing that order was made more than five years before the relevant date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say in relation to that, first, that under new Clause 4 all bankrupts having been adjudged bankrupt more than five years before the coming into force of the clause, not having had the adjudication annulled and not having been granted the discharge which had therefore become effective, will be granted an absolute discharge on the relevant date, that is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
when the clause comes into force or on the tenth anniversary of the date of adjudication whichever is the later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precisely the same result would flow from the amendment to New Clause 4, in so far as the effects in the first of two categories to which I have already alluded are concerned. That is fairly clear. The result would also be the same in so far as the third category is concerned—that is bankrupts who have applied for and been granted a conditional order of discharge, providing the order was made more than five years before the material date. That would be the case irrespective of what conditions the court might have attached to the discharge granted on that application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the bankrupt had applied for his discharge within the five years preceding the relevant date the automatic discharge provision would not apply. This is the only difference which the amendment would make. It might have some unsatisfactory consequences. or indeed, even curious ones. For example, if a bankrupt applied for a discharge five years and one day before the relevant date, and had the discharge granted, but suspended until the dividend of 50p in the pound had been paid, he would automatically be discharged on the relevant date, notwithstanding that the condition had not been fulfilled. If, however, he had applied for his discharge five years less a day before the relevant date, and the same order had been made, the automatic discharge procedure would not apply. He would remain undischarged until the condition was fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be even more curious, perhaps, if a bankrupt had applied for his discharge within the five years preceding the relevant date, and had been refused. He would automatically be discharged from the relevant date because he had applied and no absolute order of discharge had been made. Such a bankrupt would therefore be in a better position than one who had applied at the same time, and had his discharge granted subject to a condition which had not been fulfilled by the relevant date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Amendment (	<i>a</i>) to New Clause 3, is to remedy the drafting error which appeared in New Clause 3 and to which I referred on 11 th May. I do not think I need to add anything to that. I hope that, although I may have taken a long time,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
it has been helpful to the Committee, to set out our thinking, not only about our own proposals but also those which have been put forward by the Opposition following discussions with professional organisations. If we follow the course which I outlined earlier in connection with this sitting, these matters will be able to be considered further. It may be that in those circumstances the Opposition will not wish to say too much, and will reserve their position on the points which I have made. I appreciate that it is difficult to absorb these highly technical matters immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that it is useful to have what he said on the record. n view of his reference to time, let me say that we on the Opposition side do not grudge one minute of the time that he has taken in doing this. It is right and proper that we should not have an eye on the clock all the time. We should take whatever time is necessary to deal with all the points. I am glad that he has addressed us in that way this morning and I am sure that it will be useful to everybody who is interested. A lot of people are interested in the Bill, in contrast with the lack of interest in a great deal of the legislation that is passed in this House. The hon. Gentleman is also correct in surmising that I shall not do more than make a few brief observations on what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has extended his comments this morning to Clause 6 of the Bill, and I think that was correct. New Clause 4 and Clause 6 have to be considered together. They are—I shall not use the word " revolutionary " again—but if I had not already been ticked off for using it before I might have used it now because these clauses are introducing new and far-reaching provisions relating to discharge, whether it be automatic discharge under New Clause 4, or discharge following the review under Clause 6. I welcome the opportunity to say that the Government have taken a big step forward in introducing New Clause 4. I congratulate those in the Department or Departments who had a hand in doing what they have done in a comparatively short time. It is not all that long ago that the Minister was persuaded that something should be done, and if one goes back through the correspondence one realises that it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>275</span>
not long ago that he was saying that things were not necessary here. However, it is good that there has been a change. It is good that New Clause 4 introducing some automatic discharge has been brought into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side welcome the opportunity which we hope will be presented by a motion shortly to be tabled for the fullest possible discussion of the opportunities which are now opened up by the combination of New Clause 4 and Clause 6 of the Bill. That is the way in which I look at it. I am glad the Minister does not suggest that they are the last word, and what I am saying is very much in line with what he is saying. These provisions present us with the opportunity to consider all aspects of this matter and see whether we can reach an agreed solution. By "we" I mean especially those who practise and who are therefore so much more expert in the matter, rather than those of us here in the Committee who are trying to deal with the subject as best we can. If we do what is intended by the motion it will give the opportunity for the experts in the Department—and I mean no disrespect to the Minister—and the experts who have been advising us, to put their heads together and hammer out a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine myself to three areas in which we hope there will be considerable discussion, three areas which those whose views we have been able to obtain feel are areas in which there should be further thought, simply because if there is not further thought there may well be difficulties. The first area is the criteria in subsection (1) of the new clause. The cause for concern here is the specific reference to Section 26 of the 1914 Act. I speak only on what I am told, but I understand that subsection (3), which is the one which sets out the facts which are specifically referred to in subsection (1) of New Clause 4, are not, in the trade, regarded as very good or suitable for use as criteria in these new fields. The view has been expressed by some that if the wording of subsection (1) remains as it is it might have a restrictive effect. In almost every case at least one of the facts set out in Section 26(3) exists, even if it is only the one about the likelihood of being able to pay 50 per cent. of the debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is so rare to have a case in which none
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
of these facts exist that if they are to play too prominent a part in the decision as to whether these provisions should come into effect they may well be too restrictive. That is the point in general terms, and I should prefer to leave the experts to develop it in the different atmosphere of the discussions which I hope will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have appreciated that the first two sets of our amendments to which he referred were alternative suggestions put forward for dealing with that possible difficulty. Again, it is not suggested by anybody that either of them achieves perfection, but it is thought that either one of them would be less restrictive than the provisions which they would replace, if either of the amendments were accepted. It may well be that the answer lies somewhere between the two, and I shall not risk prejudicing or attempt to prejudge what the answer to those doubts and difficulties might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought the Minister was a little less than generous in what he said about the time at which the amendments were tabled. I hope it is realised by Ministers and Departments that they have a considerable back-up for their consideration of the Bill. Oppositions have none. I do not know what we should have done without the assistance of the experts, two of whom are sitting here today. They are Mr. David Graham and Mr. Alfred Goldman who are giving up their time to be here. Without their assistance in drafting the amendments and keeping us up to date, we could not have done the thing as quickly as we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not being ungenerous. I thought I said that. What I am saying is that I make no complaint about it, but it nevertheless presents difficulties for me to consider carefully what has been said when an amendment is put down late in the day. That is the only point I am making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the Minister has made that clear. I understand that, and he will understand the corollary, which is that it is even more difficult for us to do what we have done in these amendments. They are amendments to a new clause which has not been on the Amendment Paper for very long. In any event, it gives me the opportunity to pay a richly-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>277</span>
deserved tribute to those who have been of so much assistance, I was going to say "to us", but that would be too restrictive. It would be right to say "so much assistance through us to the Committee". Without the assistance of the working party and the members of the Justice committee, and in particular the two gentlemen to whom I have referred—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. and learned Gentleman has done it once. I think it would be wise to remind him of the convention that Members of the House do not refer to any other persons present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. English. I did not know that. Now I have had the best of both worlds. I have done it in all innocence, and I have learned something for the next time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area in which difficulty is felt is the area of conditional discharge. I understand that it is common for there to be an order of discharge upon condition that the debtor pays whatever the specified sum may be at such intervals as may be specified and for a given period of time. I shall not attempt to put my foot in—that was a Freudian slip. I am sure that if I did set foot in it I should put my foot in it, and I shall not risk that. The experts say that they do not see how the position of the bankrupt in respect of whom a conditional discharge has been made fits into the provisions of New Clause 4 and Clause 6. The Minister has referred, although not in much detail, to conditional discharges. It will be far better, as far as I am concerned, to give myself the opportunity both to read what he has said and to consider the comments of others who will be reading what he has said and sending us their comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third field which has caused concern is those who fall between the five- and 10-year period. There is automatic discharge after 10 years. I do not know whether there are any reservations about that but, broadly speaking, there is no doubt that it is welcome. Then we have new provisions turning on the passage of five years, but there are many people who fall in between. It may be that there is no satisfactory way of dealing with them and therefore they will have to be left to be dealt with under the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
review procedure or by means of an application under subsection (4) or Section 26. It may be too difficult to deal with the situation by any other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that that may not necessarily be regarded as too serious an objection. It is a field in which it is felt that if a better solution could be found than simply leaving those people to take advantage of the provisions to which I have referred, that would be a good thing. Unless we can, the operation of New Clause 4, Section 26 and Clause 6 could well produce some anomalies for which there would be no explanation other than the situation having to be dealt with. I hope, therefore, that in the discussions taking place some further attempts will be made to find a solution to that difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the review procedures which would apply if the Bill passed with New Clause 4 included and said that Clause 6 would apply to cases which were not caught by New Clause 4. I do not expect an answer now, but it would help us if he could give us some facts about the estimates that have been made of how New Clause 6 would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy to form a mental picture of what this would entail. On the one hand, one sees a large number of reviews in which full reports must be made out. Somebody must take the initiative, somebody must make a list of those of more than five years, somebody must say where to start, somebody must say what to do, somebody must produce a report, somebody must make the application, and so on. All those things must happen if Clause 6 remains as it is, unless it is thought that New Clause 4 would produce so many automatic discharges that the number remaining to be dealt with under Clause 6 would be comparatively small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is felt that the number of automatic discharges under New Clause 4 might not be very big, and that therefore the number falling to be dealt with under Clause 6 would be substantial, what estimates have been made of the demands which that would make upon the time of those, both in the county court and in the High Court, who would have to initiate these proceedings, and what demands it would make upon the time of the court? If we could have that information, it would help us in our later consideration of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>279</span>
matter, because we are very much concerned with the demand on the service and the courts. This has been one of the main considerations in trying to arrive at a package which hold the balance between all the different interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of how many bankruptcies will be dealt with under New Clause 4, if it is added, is very important in the context about which I have just been talking. That number will depend upon the terms of New Clause 4, so if we felt that on the present estimates—and by " we " I mean the Committee and all those outside who are interested—of the time involved Clause 6 would impose too large a burden on the service and the courts; it would be open to us to say that we should ease the conditions of New Clause 4 so as to reduce the number of cases that would be dealt with under Clause 6. I hope, therefore, that the thinking of the Minister and the Department on those matters will be made available to all of us, in whatever form is convenient to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad the Minister referred to our new clause, to some of its history, and to some of the reasons why he suggests that it is not preferable to what the Government are putting forward. I do not propose to venture into those arguments today. Of course he is right in saying that there is more than one tenable view on these matters. I merely remind him and the Committee that the Justice committee considered this in some detail, and its answer was somewhere between the two. The committees answer was not a complete adoption of Blagden, but in many respects it was very similar to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised the question, which sticks in my mind, that we were allowing too long a period. We put five years, though inadvertently, and on one occasion, two. I am much obliged to the Department and the Minister for drawing my attention to it so that I can put it right. He said that if we had the five years in that scheme it would make it all too slow. That may be a good point, and certainly we should not be averse to reducing it. Blagden said two, and Justice said three for simple cases and five for serious cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the points of view to which he has referred, and the considerations set out in Justice, need to be considered by people round a table. My guess is that the answer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
is not either wholly one or wholly the other. The final answer may be a combination of the best of all the propositions that have been advanced. At all events, it is a possibility which should be left open. I have tried to make it clear what are the main areas in which we hope there will be further discussion. It would be in the interest of the Committee at that further discussion if I left the matter there for the time being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may now be convenient, if as I understand it, the Opposition wish to reserve their position to those who wish to add something at this point to the observations that we have heard from the hon. and learned Member, I move that the debate be now adjourned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
n moving that motion may I indicate to the Committee how I see the position evolving from this point, in so far as further consideration of the Bill is concerned. Before I embark on that, I would say that this was a suggestion that emanated from the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) at a much earlier stage, probably during the Second Reading debate. We have had certain discussions, and it has been helpful for the Committee to have made this progress up to Clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it now, the situation will be that my officials—possibly I would be involved in this at some stage—will embark upon discussions with the professional bodies which have exhibited most interest in the Bill. We shall seek to cover in those discussions, the points that relate to Clause 6 and the various amendments and new clauses that have been put down in relation thereto. We should be prepared to cover the remaining provisions of the clause. I gather that there may be some feeling of apprehension on the part of the Opposition about certain aspects of Clause 7. We shall look at that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the position, the area which has caused more concern than almost any other, leaving aside the question of monetary limits which we have now, I hope, to some extent disposed of—we shall have to come back to it on Report. and which has aroused most criticism, appears to be Clause 8. I know that it has worried the Opposition. It is too early for them to specify their precise objections to it. Suffice it to say at this stage that I discussed this among other matters, with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>281</span>
the professional bodies much earlier, and I had not apprehended that they were as deeply concerned about the provisions of Clause 8 at that time as now appears to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right, therefore, that we should now engage in discussions with them. None of us wish to be in an entrenched position about Clause 8. My own immediate view, which I put on record here because again it may be helpful, is that it is an additional remedy which perhaps does not fill the void, but goes some way towards it. It has a number of deficiencies, as I readily accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important questions that will have to be considered is whether, having regard to that, it is better to have this remedy than none at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have to consider whether the limit of £1,000 is right. My own inclination—I put it no higher than that, and I am not committed to this view, because it is not my clause, as members of the Committee know—is to put up the limit to £2,000. That again is a matter which can be further considered by the officials and professional bodies, and no doubt it would be wrong for me to suggest that the Opposition are to be included in this discussion. I have tried during the course of the Bill to carry on a dialogue with them outside the Committee, with the purpose which we both have of generally improving the Bill. The Bill has no politically contentious matter in it. It is a matter where there are differing views about technicalities and about the best way in which the insolvency law may operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be helpful, therefore, to adjourn further consideration of the Bill to enable these discussions to take place. It may be that we shall arrive at an agreed solution, and if we cannot achieve that objective at least we shall clarify the differences between us. I am fairly sure that a number of these differences will be eliminated in consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one other point to make, Mr. English, quite separate from the remarks that I have just made about the consultations that we hope will follow. The hon. Member for Worthing invited me to say a word at some later stage about the report on the insolvency Service by the management review team, I shall try to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
get that out of the way at this stage, although I thought I had substantially dealt with the points that had been raised in relation to it earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition raised two points concerning that report. First, how did it come about that I had possession of the report, it if was another Government's document? Secondly, they asked whether the report could be made available to the House. Those are the two essential points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the first point is concerned, how I came to be in possession of it, it is an established principle that a new Administration should not have access to the papers, especially Cabinet papers, of the previous Administration of a different political complexion. There is a perfectly rational reason for that. It is designed to avoid embarrassment to previous Ministers by the disclosure to the new Ministers of their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I said on 6th May 1976—I refer to column 173 of 	<i>Hansard—</i> that the ducument was totally uncontentious and had no political implication at all. It is entirely factual and does not in any sense reflect or record the views of Ministers in the previous Administration. It was thought, therefore, that there was no reason why I should not have access to that report. If we were to consider the matters which we are now contemplating, on a sensible basis, before we reached the point of presenting a Bill, it was rather important that I should have a look at it, and I say frankly and openly to the Committee that this is why the report was presented to me and why I thought it right that I should have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the second point, whether it could be made available to the House, it was produced for use within the Department and, in common with similar documents of a confidential and restricted nature, it was not laid before the House or otherwise published. This is a doctrine with which I think the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), who is a former Minister, will be familiar. It is for that reason that I deliberately chose not to quote from the report. Otherwise, I should have been placed in the embarrassing position of having to lay it on the Table. I hope that that will have clarified an issue which I know has perturbed the hon. Gentleman and that he will feel I was justified in taking the course that I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the motion which the Under-Secretary has just moved is not unprecedented, even in the context in which it is before us this morning, although I think it has not been made entirely clear precisely what he intended. As I understand it,—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might assist the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. It was simply that the Minister did not spell that out. I understand that there will be a further motion, Mr. English, which will clarify the position as far as any further consideration of the Bill is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, it might be helpful if I made one or two comments on what the Minister has just said. The first point is that the Bill is undoubtedly one of considerable public interest, although it may not yet have come fully to the attention of the public. Certainly many debtors, or potential debtors, are involved, and also many creditors are anxious to know how in future they are likely to stand with regard to taking procedures which will obtain them their money. It is of widespread interest, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (M r. Fletcher-Cooke) pointed out, particularly on the point of public examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also the 100,000 undischarged bankrupts who have been referred to in the course of our debates who obviously have a substantial interest in the Bill and who, without it, would be roaming the countryside still undischarged for reasons which we have considered. The first point is therefore that the Bill is of wider interest than may have been generally realised outside the House of Commons at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that we have made considerable progress in our consideration of the Bill, not least, if I may say so, because of the considerable amount of sheer hard work and intellectual thought which has been given to the matter by my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival). As the Committees will realise, he has done a great deal of work, particularly in preparing the various amendments which we have been discussing. I have been most grateful to him for all his help on what are highly technical matters. We have not made bad progress in improving the Bill or in working our way through it. Therefore, those points are worthy of consideration when we come to consider the motion which the Under-Secretary has just made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worth summarising the situation as far as some of the earlier parts are concerned as well as some of the later parts, because the two are closely related. I want to stress this to the Minister. If he is proposing that further consultations shall take place and further consideration shall be given to the matter before it is resumed in this place, it is important that the balance between the various clauses should be taken into account, because some of them are concerned with reducing the load on the Insolvency Service. Some of the clauses work one way by reducing the load, and some work the other way by increasing it. The amendments may also have an effect one way or the other. I am sure that the Minister's consideration ought to take into account the whole Bill as it now stands, rather than simply the clauses which we have not yet considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the case that Clause I is now somewhat battered. I do not think that need necessarily give rise to any real problems at later stages. I think that a few consequential amendments to tidy up any loose ends which remain after we have removed the clause which gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations could easily be tabled on Report. There is no great problem about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more concerned about Schedule 1, which is related to Clause I and deals with the monetary limits. I think I mentioned earlier that my basic propensity was that I would stand up to some extent for the debtors, and my hon. and learned Friend would stand for the creditors. But the longer the debates have gone on, the more I have been persuaded that the balance between those two in the Bill as it now stands is probably not right, with a £300 limit for bankruptcy. Clearly some increase in the £50 limit set in 1869 needs to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
be made, but as our debates have proceeded I have realised that the alternatives to bankruptcy proceedings are far fewer than I supposed and, as it is becoming increasingly apparent, far fewer than the Minister supposed. The more he enumerated the alternatives, the more it became apparent that most of them were either irrelevant of insignificant. I hope, therefore, that, in the consideration which is now to be given before we resume, that point will especially be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given careful ccnsideration to Clauses 2, 3 and 4. I do not wish to comment on those in detail, except to say, first, that I think the Bill is much improved by the consideration that we have given to it and, secondly, that it would be a shame if that work were either wasted or duplicated. We did not want to create a situation in which the Bill was killed stone dead, and I understand that that is not the Minister's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister recognises, we are now coming to the more difficult clauses of this non-controversial Bill. It is quite true, as he says that there is little of a partisan aspect to it. I doubt whether the votes of more than one or two of our constituents at the outside will be influenced by what we do on this matter. None the less, although it is not partisan, it was probably a little optimistic of the Minister—and of the Government—to describe it as a noncontroversial Bill. Few things proceed with more care and deliberation in this place than Bills which are open to improvement, as against those which are purely controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Bill was introduced, the Government had the results of committees which sat in 1906, in 1925 and in 1957 in particular—the Blagden Committee—as well as the reports of Justice and the various views of the joint working party of both the Bar Council and the Law Society. It is unfortunate that the Bill as originally drafted did not appear to have taken those views adequately into account or that there had been adequate consultation. I do not want to stress that point, as we have raised it already, except to say that there is
	<br><blockquote><p>"more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth"</p></blockquote>
than otherwise. If the Minister is now prepared to continue these processes of consultation which he has quite rightly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>286</span>
undertaken since the Bill was introduced and the Committee stage was begun, that would be very helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our sole object on both sides of the Committee is to ensure that we have the right answer and the right amendments to the Bill. I certainly accept that throughout the Minister has sought to take into account both outside views and the views of this side of the Committee, and it is right that that should continue. If he had not moved this motion this morning, we should then have been in a position where these consultations would have been taking place under great pressure. As my hon. and learned Friend has pointed out, there are real problems if we spend time drafting amendments which the Government have to consider in haste, and if the Government produce amendments at short notice which we have to look at under great pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right, therefore, that there should be a breathing space within which these matters can be gone into more fully. I welcome the motion which the Minister has moved, subject to whatever he says in the subsequent motion. I must reserve my position on that, because I have not the slightest notion what he will propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are obviously some major differences on Clause 6, there are substantial points on Clause 7 and, in particular, there is still Clause 8. My view is that it remains highly objectionable, and that the right thing to do is to drop it. The doctrine of collective responsibility has been reasserted recently by the Prime Minister. I was a little worried by the Under-Secretary's statement that Clause 8 was not his clause. He will, of course, be required to give consideration to it, together with the other related Government Departments, before expressing, I trust, an overall Government view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not underestimate the pressures which arise when various Departments have different views on any aspect of a Bill, but my own feeling is that the best thing to do would be to drop Clause 8. It may prove to be possible to amend it in some satisfactory way, but for that we shall have to wait and see. There is, however, a close relationship between it and the limits of the earlier parts of the Bill, for reasons which I have mentioned. One could not look at any amendment to Clause 8, other than in the context of those earlier clauses.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>287</span>
It has been satisfactory and helpful of the Minister to set out his views this morning on the point that we have reached in the Bill. It was worth giving time to that. Given the unsatisfactory nature of the measure at Second Reading—the hon. Gentleman recalls that at that stage I suggested that we ought to adjourn until we had managed to sort the thing out—I should be happy to go along with what he has now proposed. We do not necessarily want to see the Bill killed. It will depend on how flexible an attitude the Minister takes. Provided he is flexible and that the proposals he subsequently makes are satisfactory, it would certainly mean that Parliament was doing its job. I have paid tribute to the Minister for adopting a flexible attitude. I hope that we can do our job properly and end up with a Bill which may even turn out to be the most improved Bill that has ever gone through this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) for what he said about me but, as I have already said, from the technical point of view what has been done on this side could not possibly have been done without the assistance of those to whom I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A view is beginning to grow outside the House that unless we can put the Bill into an acceptable form, it would be better not to have it at all. That would be a great pity, and certainly in some clauses we can make improvements, albeit small ones. I would probably include Clause 5 in that. It would be a terrible waste, both of the legislative opportunity presented by a Bill having reached this stage, and of all the work that has so far been done, if that were to happen. I do not, therefore, subscribe to that view at the moment. I welcome what is to be proposed, largely for the reasons that my hon. Friend expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say a word about Clause 8, as the Minister has referred to it, in order that these observations may be on the record and therefore included when further consideration takes place. The Minister said he had not fully appreciated what a firm view the professions take on this. I am rather surprised at that since the joint working party, in the memorandum submitted as long ago as December, had the better part of a page on this subject.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>288</span>
It listed the reasons why it did not like Clause 8 and ended by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are alarmed at the implications of Clause 8 and we recommend that the provision should be omitted altogether from the Bill."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since then, as the hon. and learned Gentleman must recognise, we have had prolonged discussions with the professional bodies. I myself discussed the matter with them—that is what I was referring to—and at that point, which was much more recent than December, I thought that many of the problems had been eradicated, and that to that extent, therefore, the hostility to Clause 8 which was exhibited in that document no longer remained at anything like the same intensity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only say that my information is different. I have been in touch with those bodies not merely at one meeting, at which there were discussions, but habitually. The Minister will appreciate that I have taken the greatest of care before quoting my authority for a statement to satisfy myself that I still had the authority to make it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that this discussion is fruitless, since the motion is to give further consideration to the Bill? There will be plently of opportunity to find out whether the statements of the Minister or of the Opposition Front Bench are correct, whereas to discuss them now is pointless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have finished with that point, Mr. English. It was in reply to a point made by the Minister, inviting him to look into it, and I have no doubt that he will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make brief points about Clause 8 which I hope will be taken into consideration. They are considerations which have affected the minds of everybody who is disturbed about Clause 8. The Minister said that the purposes of this clause was to provide an additional remedy. That is what concerns many of us. If there were any evidence that it was a remedy that anybody thought would be useful, perhaps we should be pleased to see it there and would bend our efforts towards improving it and getting rid of its dangers. A little homework on the civil judicial statistics shows that the figure has been going down
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>289</span>
and down. The question of the limit of the jurisdiction may have something to do with that, and it may be that to raise the jurisdiotion—a point to which the Minister specifically referred in moving this motion—would make a difference. I am bound, however, to draw his attention to the fact, because otherwise he might not look at this point, that even when the jurisdiction was increased from £500 to £1,000, the number of administration orders kept going down. It has gone down from a £3,000 peak in the 1970s to £2,100 last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also draw the Minister's attention to the fact because we are concerned with alternative remedies, that in those same civil judicial statistics one finds that the attachment of earnings orders to which he referred have been going down by the significant amount of 20 per cent. a year. That is not surprising when one looks into the statistics, because one sees there how many of the orders that are made lapse because the man leaves his employment. I hope that that will be considered. The further research that some of us have done has led us, on each occasion when we have looked at the effect of a particular remedy, to find that it is even less effective than we thought it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, while I am on civil judicial statistics, I refer the hon. Member to page 22 of the statistics for 1974 because there he will find one of the answers which he said would require more analysis than he felt could take place. On judgment summonses I said that it would be interesting to know what the breakdown was of the 5,000 and the 8,000 and he said that would require a great deal of analysis. He will find a good deal of the answer on that page which is that most of the summonses in 1974 were for arrears of income tax, as I thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the first thing we should like him to look at. When we go into it, it is not surprising that the number is going down because if we look further into these statistics, we find a figure for the number of administration orders which were effective, that is to say, which produced the money. They are in the lists as the orders which were discharged. That means discharged fully paid. n 1972 385 orders were discharged repaid but the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>290</span>
average time it took for that process to be completed was 34 months—nearly three years. A fat lot of good that is to a person of modest means who is trying to recover a small debt. In 1973 the number was 482, that is more—and the average time was even longer-36 months. In 1974 the number was 597 and the average time was 40 months. No wonder people are not using this and do not want to use it if the recovery rate is as low and the recovery period is as long as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the reasons for it. Do not let us delude outselves into saying "Here is a remedy and this will help us to adjust the balance", when all the indications point the other way. Furthermore, if we look into it a bit further, there may be good reason for seeing why it works out like that, because I have read the provisions of the County Court Act 1959 which lay down this procedure and I realise now that the court in which the administration order is made has very little power to make it effective. It is really only a question of getting in some of the man's income. The power to take his assets to meet his obligations is very small indeed. No wonder the recovery rate is so poor and people do not use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Department and the Minister will consider this in their further considerations. Yes, we could put these things right. Yes, we could give the county court enforcement procedures more teeth. But what will the cost of it be? Although I have had quite a close look at these figures I have not been able to discover who meets the costs of these administration orders. Clearly there are a great number of them which produce very little. Less than a quarter, or about a sixth are discharged each year, except in the last year when there were more discharges because the number of arrears had piled up. Where do the costs fall? What staff is there to carry out an administration order if one is made and so on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister also, in case he or anybody else might have been misled by what the Payne committee said about administration orders, to have a look at what that committee said. It is perfectly true that it recommended the increased use of administration orders but, if one looks at its recommendations again, one realises that what it was talking about was something quite different from what we are talking about here. It was talking about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>291</span>
administration orders in the context of setting up an enforcement office which would then have the staff, the legal backup and all the facilities for giving effect to administration orders. None of those exist at the moment and so it is small wonder that the remedy is not used. It really is stretching a point to say that it in any way makes up for the deprivation of remedies which result from the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of other considerations go into Clause 8 which have been drawn to my attention in the course of discussions which we have had. Under Clause 8, it seems that the court may collect entirely of its own motion without any notice to the debtor, without any right of the debtor to say " No, please do not do that " and without any right to the creditor or creditors to be heard. These points were taken up by a joint working party of the Law Society in its first document so they have been on the record all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that I think people ought to realise is that the minute an administration order is made, all creditors are then prevented from taking any individual steps. All the legal processes are then denied to creditors. It seems to many of us a strange thing to introduce provision under which the court may of its own motion without notice to anybody, without hearing anybody else, take a step which will have all or even the major odd results to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather glad to hear the Minister refer in particular to Clause 8 because it is the one which needs the most consideration, and consideration of a different kind. We are all hoping with regard to New Clause 4 and Clause 6 that further consideration will produce a workable deal with which everybody can agree. Certainly that is my hope. It would be a significant contribution to the law of insolvency. I hope that in considering Clause 8 the Minister will consider it in that quite different light—whether it is worthwhile to try to remove the features in it that alarmed the joint working party. Even if we removed those, it would be quite impossible at this stage to give teeth to this procedure, which those who have to collect debts have shown to be one in which they have no confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we would respond to the suggestion thrown out by the Minister that it might be useful if we took part in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
the discussions. We leave it to him to make practical suggestions in that respect. I think it would be a good thing if there were some sort of round table meeting of all concerned because that avoids people getting different impressions as to what people are saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the debate be resumed upon a date to be fixed by the Chairman.—[Mr. 	<i>Clinton Davis.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With no personal disrespect to you, Mr. English, perhaps I might say a word about that as the Minister has not sought to argue in favour of the motion which he has just proposed. I presume, in the situation which we are now in, that there are two alternatives open to us. One would be to fix a definite date. The other is the one which the Minister has proposed. I think we should be a little clearer as to exactly what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a point which I made on Second Reading, that the Government apparently propose to introduce a Companies (No. 2) Bill. The individuals who are concerned with this measure are almost precisely the same as those who are concerned with the Companies (No. 2) Bill and the clear intention was originally—and I thought this was generally understood between us—that this Bill would proceed and we would not begin the Committee stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill until this Bill had moved out of Committee. A suggestion that we should sit Tuesdays and Thursdays on this Bill, and Wednesdays and perhaps another day on the other Bill, given the various commitments which hon. Members have in carrying out their party duties or perhaps their duties on either Front Bench on a whole range of trade matters which are vastly diversified, would create a very unsatisfactory situation. Therefore I think we should be clear as to what the Minister actually intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is how you, Mr. English, see your responsibilities in this matter. I have no doubt that there are precedents for this procedure. I am sure that with your usual skill you will have studied them carefully. Is it a matter within your absolute discretion or is it a matter on which you would be prepared to receive representations either way, particularly for example on the point which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>293</span>
I have just raised, because the programme at the moment is extremely congested?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Minister's views on timing, it would be helpful if some indication could be given of what is intended. There is a real problem here. We have to carry out consultations and also to consider our position, draft amendments, which would then need to be tabled, counter arguments produced, and so on. This raises another point on which I am not clear and that is whether we can continue to table amendments in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves. My hon. and learned Friend suggested a moment ago that there might be a case for having a round table conference. My view is that we should be concerned about that, because this is a matter which must be considered by this Committee. We cannot remove the matter from here to some other place. We need to consider carefully the implications of that suggestion. I should be grateful if the Minister could make his position clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I did not make myself clear. I had in mind that if we could arrive at a Bill that was agreed there was still a hope of its being placed on the statute book. Unless we come near to that on timing alone, there seems to be difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand very well the point that my hon. Friend is making. I am stressing that it is still a matter for this Committee whether it is happy with what has otherwise been agreed. I do not wish to pursue that point. I am expressing a personal view as an immediate reaction to what was suggested. It is no more than that. Obviously one would need to consider it. If we could have a clear indication from the Minister of the Government's views, and perhaps an answer on the points which are matters for the Chair, I should be most grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the latter point? The motion, as I understand it, relates to the fixing of the date by the Chairman to recreate the situation which exists with all Bills at the beginning. There is no sittings motion at the beginning of a Bill. It has been referred to a Committee, but it has never arrived in a Committee, and the Chairman technically fixes the date
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
of the first meeting of the Committee of all Bills. At that first meeting there is a sittings motion, and the Committee thereafter determines when and how it will meet to consider the Bill. When the Chairman fixes the first meeting, he or the Clerk's Department, or both, always consult representatives of both sides of the Committee, through the usual channels primarily with a view to determining the date that is satisfactory to everybody. That is what I would propose to do in the light of this motion were it to be passed. I would use exactly the same procedure as applies at the beginning of all Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, amendments may be tabled, and if they are Committee amendments they may be tabled only on the parts of the Bill which we have not considered so far. If the hon. Member means that he wants to table amendments in relation to clauses which we have considered, he must keep those up his sleeve for the time being until we deal with the Bill on consideration in the House on Report. It is still open to amendments in one respect or another. They can either be ready for the Report stage or insofar as we have not finished the Bill they can be tabled to the remaining parts of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you Mr. English for the views which you have just stipulated. I turn to the points raised by the hon. Gentleman which affect me rather than you. He has adverted to the Companies (No. 2) Bill which is due to have its Second Reading through the Committee procedure next Wednesday. It is not intended that the Committee stage will take place before the end of the consideration of this insolvency Bill. It would be difficult for that to happen, because I have the conduct of both of them and there is no intention on my part to sit on Mondays and Wednesdays, if that were to be at all practical, which I doubt. We would hope to proceed with the Committee stage of that Bill shortly after the conclusion of the Committee stage of this one, but not, I suspect, before the Report stage of this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the situation and option available for us to determine later on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may speed up proceedings if I interupt the Minister. We were confused because, before my previous intervention, I think by a slip of the tongue the Minister put it the wrong way round. As I understand what he is now saying, it is not proposed by the Government that the Committee stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, should it have a good second reading, will begin before the conclusion of the Committee stage of this Bill. So much is clear. He is further saying, in the correction which he made to his earlier slip of the tongue, that with regard to the Report stage of this Bill—and I now realise how difficult it is to express this—it is not proposed that the Committee stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill will necessarily be delayed until after the Report stage of this Bill. So far so good. The Minister then said it is uncertain whether the Report stage of this Bill given that it is a Second Reading Committee Bill, will be on the Floor of the House, At that point I am worried I think the Committee should be worried because that would possibly still run us into the same dilemma which I mentioned earlier with regard to the Committee stage of this Bill and the Companies (No. 2) Bill. We could have both the Report stage of this Bill running upstairs and the Committee stage of the other Bill running upstairs. I hope, therefore, that he can assure us that he is not proposing to take the Report stage of this Bill upstairs. I think that would be a most unsatisfactory situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give any clear assurances. I think I am right in saying
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
that we shall discuss this matter. We do not want to embarrass anybody in terms of time and effort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is intolerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give assurances, because we have to see what progress we make. As I understand the position with the new procedure, it is possible for a Report stage to take place in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might assist hon. Members if I draw their attention to the relevant Standing Order, which is Standing Order No. 73. It is one which has been rarely, if ever, used. Without mentioning the whole Standing Order, the gist of it is that a Report stage in Committee can be objected to by 20 Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Floor of the House, so I do not think there is any doubt in the minds of the Government or the Opposition that it could be achieved only by agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. That is what I was seeking to say. I do not want to create some sort of monster here. It may be that both sides, discussing the matter together, would feel that this was an appropriate way of dealing with this Bill, rather than taking it on to the Floor of the House. We shall have to wait and see about that. I was anxious to establish that in the intervening period between now and the time that we both feel may be appropriate for this Bill to be brought back into Committee, there should be reasonable opportunity for discussion and I will certainly look carefully at the proposition advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival), though viewed with some degree of caution by his hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). I shall have to arbitrate in that dispute.

I do not wish a pistol to be held at the heads of those conducting the discussions, in terms of time. My mind has certainly not closed upon the possibilities of change. It has been helpful that we have reached the present stage, and we can assume that it will not be difficult to arrive at an agree-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
ment between both sides as to when it is appropriate for this Committee to consider the Bill again. If no agreement were to be arrived at, the Government would of course have to make their recommendations, but I do not think that that is likely to arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: n view of the general legal atmosphere of the Committee, to avoid all doubt, I think one should make clear what our position would be on any question of the Bill being taken in Committee on Report. We are against any such proposal, because a number of hon. Members were unable to serve on this Committee because they are serving on other Committees. I know a number of our colleagues would wish to take part in the Report stage, which would be impossible if it were taken in Committee. There should be no doubt on that point. I do not wish to delay the Committee any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that hon. Members can attend the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so. Even so, it is clearly a matter for the Floor of the House, not for Committee. It would be wrong for the Report stage of a Bill of this importance to be taken in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other points which hon. Members made, I am sure that consultations can take place. Our sole intention is that the Bill should be a sensible piece of legislation. Given that some aspects have remained unchanged since 1869, we should not now go ahead with unsatisfactory measures. We do not often legislate on these matters and we should do so carefully. I welcome the Minister's remarks about the proposals for further consultation, and do not wish to object further to his motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
