	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right at the very end of our Third Sitting a new phenomenon was brought into the debate—the reference to the new Scottish Labour Party. Yesterday, downstairs, we heard a little more about the development of that organisation. If I were to take the opportunity this morning of giving my views on devolution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—I know that you, Mr. Costain, would rule me out of order. Therefore, I will heed your sedentary warning and not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This whole matter was raised because the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) challenged me on whether I had written to various consumer organisations to ascertain their views on our amendment for the phasing out, or abolition, of the Consumers Committee, whether this met their wishes, and whether they were happy about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the advantage of the back-up facilities and services of a Government in power, and I readily admit that I have not written to all the consumer organisations—in particular the one, I believe in Scotland, to which the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West referred. But the fact is that these amendments have been on the Amendment Paper for a month, and bearing in mind the present, and recent, zealousness of consumers and consumer organisations I am convinced that they would have made representations to the Opposition if they were unhappy about our determination to phase out and abolish the Consumers Committee of the Meat and Livestock Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only assume that consumer organisations believe, in my view quite rightly, that they are able to negotiate and consult effectively direct with the Meat and Livestock Commission or with the Ministry itself. I therefore await with considerable interest the Minister's reply justifying the continuation of the Consumers Committee, whilst at the same time he puts his case, which we will fully support, for the phasing out and abolition of the Production Committee and the Distribution Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I started to move this amendment you, Mr. Costain, said that you would allow a fairly general debate hoping that when each amendment was discussed later the debate would be relatively short. I therefore look to you, Mr. Costain, to use discretion about the wide-ranging remarks that I am about to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major issues of this whole clause is consultation—consultation with the various sectors within the meat and livestock industry and with the various industries and interests within the meat and livestock sector. From the number of amendments tabled to the Bill, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
in particular to Clause 3, one can see that there is considerable concern and interest in the Bill. There is a widespread belief that, although the Ministry wants the consultation between interested parties within the meat and livestock sector to be improved in relation to consultation with the Meat and Livestock Commission, the Bill as it stands will not substantially improve the consultative arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message I have received from a large number of organisations, of which I have mentioned some—the Smithfield Market Fresh Meat Traders' Association, the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers, the Meat Manufacturers' Association, the National Farmers' Union, and others—clearly indicates that the industry would like further amendments to the Bill to ensure that participation with the Meat and Livestock Commission is really meaningful consultation, not just something that is done in order to meet the basis of some clause or subsection in a Bill, with no real meaning behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new Section 1A requires the Commission to consult organisations if it appears to the Commission that such consultation is called for. The Bill does not provide in detail for the mechanics of consultation. More important, seemingly, it cannot lay down how the MLC is to judge when to consult. in practice, it could mean that matters important to trade would not be the subject of consultation. It is for that reason, among others, that we require various amendments to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal of feeling within the trade and by interests within the meat and livestock industry about levy increases, future programme, capital expenditure, and numerous other matters. The application to Parliament by the Meat and Livestock Commission for an increase in the maxima of levy at the point of slaughter was debated in April last year. Arising from that debate on a Statutory Instrument, it was conceded that an examination of the MLC by officials of the Ministry should take place. The results, of course, would be reported to the appropriate Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister of State will he aware that evidence was given orally and in written form. A number of important points were made by the interests
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
represented. They said—again, with full justification, in my opinion—that no consultation had taken place with the industry about the establishment of the carcase evaluation unit at Blisworth and the cattle improvement units at Sutton Bonnington and Ingliston. They also commented on the paper loss on equities investment put against the general account. That was one of the arguments put forward by the MLC for a levy increase. Numerous other matters were put forward, which I believe fully justify their case in stating that there was insufficient negotiation and consultation at the right time by the MLC with the interests within the meat and livestock industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saying all that, I hope that the Minister will not assume that we are totally critical of the functions and activities of the MLC. Far from it. I much appreciate the work and progress that has been made by the MLC since it was formed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side are critical of the increase of 31 per cent. after netting of income in the general livestock and improvement services. Surely that calls for a complete reappraisal and study of the services. We are also particularly critical of the on-farm testing and recording, which is up by some 90,000, an increase of 40.7 per cent. net. Surely the Minister would agree that the majority of the Commission's services should be cost effective and self-financing by these services and what the services are charging. Where carcase classification is employed primarily to authenticate weight, this charge surely should be on levy income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry also feels some concern that university grants are not only too high—the total cost, I think, is about £196,000—but are leading to overlapping of research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are just some of the matters that have been brought to my attention in the representations made to me by various sectors of the industry which are concerned that, while we are debating the clause, the Government should try to ensure positive and meaningful consultation. Consultation and negotiation for their own sake are hopeless, do not help the industry, and do not help the relationship which I believe is important between the MLC and the meat and livestock industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
The number of amendments on the Notice Paper clearly indicates that, despite the Government's move to ensure more positive negotiation and consultation, the procedures for ensuring meaningful consultation are still inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to one or two of the other amendments. Amendment No. 15, on Northern Ireland, is a probing amendment. I am not sure, despite some of the remarks made by the National Farmers' Union and also by the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers, that Northern Ireland should not be involved in some way in the Bill. Devolution is, I know, the trendy debate at present; but trade, as we know, does take place between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It is all part of the concept of united countries. I hope that the Minister will comment at some length on this matter, though I admit that the amendment as drafted is very much a probing one. Certainly it is not the Opposition's intention to press it to a division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise Amendment No 18, which seeks to add veterinary surgeons to the Schedule, is a probing amendment. Bearing in mind some of the functions of the Meat and Livestock Commission—breeding, transportation, slaughterhouses, and others—I believe that veterinary officers have an important part to play, and it would be helpful if they were included on the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider that this is an important clause and that the majority of our amendments are positive, constructive and helpful and will improve the process of consultation between the MLC and the various sectors of the meat and livestock industry. To date, the representations that I have received—I have a whole bunch of letters here, and I have had telephone calls and messages—are to the effect that this consultation has not been what it should be. If the relationship between the MLC and the interests within the meat and livestock industry are to be good in the future, I hope that the Minister will be prepared to accept some of the amendments. Where he finds it necessary to refuse to accept them, I hope that he will go to some lengths in seeking to justify his decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Joan Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading I expressed my concern about consultation. The Production Committee and the Distribution Committee are to go. I believe that the argument is that they did not work very well. I do not know that that is necessarily a good argument for getting rid of them. It might be an argument for trying to improve them. It seems to me that getting rid of these committees will weaken the MLC at a time when it ought to be strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned that the producers and the people who work in the industry should be properly consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although these two committees are to be done away with, as the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said there is no mechanism for consultation to replace them. I hope that the Minister will explain to me how the workers in the industry are to be consulted. My union is particularly interested in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interest in agriculture is limited entirely to stock. I am, therefore, one of those who has contributed a large sum in recent years to the Meat and Livestock Commission. The Committee will be aware that it is farmers who are effectively paying these levies and not the butchers, as was originally envisaged when this provision was introduced in the Agriculture Act 1967.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my neighbours, I have contributed large sums to the Meat and Livestock Commission and I have yet to see a penny piece in return by way of value for what we have contributed. I have no optimistic feelings whatsoever towards the future of the Commission. It cannot contribute very much to the prosperity of agriculture, despite the fact that we are giving such large sums towards it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment in so far as we should be eating into the Commission's powers and reducing, to some extent, its activities. Therefore, I am willing to agree to the amendment to bring to an end the Consumers Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) used the phrase " proper consultation". There should be proper consultation. Indeed, I venture the view that, if proper consul-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
tations were made now with farmers and farm workers—after all, their interests are one and the same and the incomes of farm workers are dependent upon those of farmers—there would be a different view expressed about the value of the MLC. I think that my opinion would be supported by a majority now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has been a disappointment and, given the fact that so much money has gone its way, so many millions of pounds, we have not had a return appropriate to that investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) spoke about the return for pig producers and went so far as to say that the progeny testing has been totally at the administrative expense of the MLC. I do not know where he got that from. I should like to hear more from him at some suitable moment about whether that be true. But as a pig producer myself, and as a national officer of a pig producers' organisation who is very much in touch with pig producers all over the country, I have yet to hear any strong words of gratitude about the Commission's expenditure in pig progeny testing. Of course the MLC has been helpful, but this kind of work was being done commercially by other organisations—such as Wall's for those who were in its scheme—by hybrid breeders and by professional breeders like myself. I should have said that it was not impossible to have co-ordinated that work, if coordination were necessary, without imposing upon it this great superstructure of the MLC, as expensively administered as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to sound over-critical about the matter. I respect enormously both the present chairman and his predecessor. Both have been considerable diplomats and the Commission is lucky to have had two such men leading it. However, although one can say that and pay a personal tribute to them—it is a warm tribute that I pay to them both—I still believe that the machine itself, the apparatus for which they are responsible, is not what the industry needs. It has not proved a total failure—one must not say that; that would be an extravagant way of putting it—but it has proved a real disappointment to those of us who supported it at the beginning and those of us who have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
contributed so much money—it is a large sum in my case—towards it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the first amendment, one realises that the consumer's voice is inadequately expressed at any official level. It is almost impossible really to bring together a committee of people who can adequately represent the views of consumers. In regard to meat, there are millions of consumers. They are able to switch their purchases from buying beef to pork or some other commodity week by week. They are people who, very often, prefer to be guided by their own butchers if they have the good fortune to have a family butcher to go to in their locality. Their interests cannot be generalised about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to see how this Consumers Committee can be valuable, given the fact that the consumer has the last word in the meat trade. Those of us who produce meat always have to remember this. If we are not making a livelihood, it is not the fault of the housewife or the consumer; it is our fault for not producing what the consumer wants. Unless we in agriculture face that fact, we have no business to be engaged in trying to produce something for others to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I come back to an old saying. Forgive me, Mr. Costain, if you have heard it many times before. The price mechanism whereby the consumer decides these matters and votes constantly daily and weekly is like a continuous General Election. It is not once in four years when the housewife casts a vote and says " I shall always buy pork " or " I shall always buy beef and it will always be at this price". It is a continuous General Election when she is voting week by week, casting a vote for one kind of meat in preference to another, or abstaining from voting—we know how effective an abstention from voting can be—when she decides to buy no meat in that week at all, as many housewives are now doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The votes cast week by week by the consumers in their millions are recorded by the returning officers who are the butchers, the wholesalers in the meat industry, the meat manufacturers and, ultimately, by the farmers. They, at the end of the day, are the returning officers in this process of a continuous General Election in which the customer is day by day expressing his orher preference
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
for the kind of meat that is wanted on the dinner tables in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sort of consultation is effective. It works, and we do not wish to have these statutory women and other people gathered together on a Consumers Committee who must find it difficult to express objective opinions, who will be expressing what are really their own opinions, as to what they themselves may wish to have. That is a form of arrogance which is not appropriate when one is trying to express the interests of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment wholeheartedly, but in doing so I cast doubt, once more, upon the value of what the Commission is doing. It has been a most expensive beast, being fed liberally upon the levies that we have produced. I for one—this view is shared by every other member in the organisation of which I am the national chairman concerned with meat production—believe that we could have invested the money we have given by way of levies far better in such a way that housewives would have had a better bargain than they have had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have had considerable experience as a livestock auctioneer of the workings of the MLC as a sort of bufferstate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
between the farmer and the meat interests. It is always a difficult matter trying to hold the balance between the various interests in this case. My colleagues know that I have always expressed the gravest possible doubts, since the beginning of the MLC's reign, as to whether this body was necessary. We have the market mechanism, as my colleague the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has explained, and this is how the Ministry finds out what is the correct demand and pricing up and down the country, through the markets and sales from farmers to butchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a great cry by all the advisers to the Ministry some years ago that no one would eat anything but little bullocks slaughtered when they weighed about 7cwt. We do not want them; they are highly expensive. There is a certain trade in Newmarket and London perhaps—the richer areas—for that type of beast. But I do not believe that the MLC can detect the trends ahead in the way that the trade does. It is the butchers who are buying, whether in wholesale markets, deadweight markets or live markets, who know what the consumer wants. They soon find out whether there is a demand for fat heifers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In areas where heavy work was done there used to be demands for large and fatty cattle. But to go to the other extreme, as we were advised to do a few years ago, has been disastrous in that it has meant that an Aberdeen Angus bull of any size cannot be obtained these days. Many other well-known breeds, like the beef Shorthorn, has been reduced to a secondary position because of the small size of the bulls coming forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not intend to say all that, but my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston spoke the evident truth when he said that if the market mechanism is interfered with, be it by any form of Government or other agency of this sort, that is likely to do more harm than good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I wish to pay a tribute to those who have guided the MLC recently. I have had connections not only with the head officials but with others in the MLC, and I have found them dedicated people who are doing their level best to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
carry out the instructions of the Act which set up that body. But what worries me is the growth of the MLC's tentacles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody is becoming alarmed at the growth of organisations which produce nothing; and, though I do not say that this body is a prime example, they are spreading their wings to a great extent. This is why I am pleased to see the Government putting forward their suggestions for doing away with the two Committees, and why I wholly support the amendment which seeks to disband the Consumers Committee. I am convinced that the best consultation that can take place, provided that it is full consultation, is not by drawing together consumer organisations from all over the country to the Ministry every month or two, which is a time-wasting procedure. Time is enormously important and valuable, and the time of all these head bods coming together for these meetings is taken up, whereas I am sure that consultations can just as well be carried out direct with the organisations by telephone calls, personal calls, and so on, by the MLC. So I fully support the disbandment of the Consumers Committee along with the other two Committees. That is only a small step towards cutting some of the costs of the MLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must not be forgotten that the costs of these organisations—the Ministry of Agriculture, and everything—are added on to the cost of meat, which is passed on to the consumer. The costs of producing meat are high already. They must be high, if livestock men, workers, herdsmen, and so on, are paid properly as they should be. They are the most skilled people in farming. But we do not want any unnecessary costs. They only reduce the amount of meat consumed. The more costs are pushed up, the more resistance there is to the purchase of meat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point that there are already sufficient excellent, constructive, well-organised consumer bodies that can make representations direct to the MLC? The Ministry itself seems happy to deal with the list that I read out when we started debating the clause. Does it not seem totally unnecessary to have the bureaucracy and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
the service that is needed with any committee, however big or small, when there already are a number of excellent, effective consumer organisations which can make representations direct to whatever body it may be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend I am afraid the amount of cosmetics that are being applied to consumers is a sign of the Government's thinking: the way in which it is pretended that the Government are helping them. There is the wasteful example of examining the computer which one consults if one cannot find a girl-friend. I understand that the costs of this computer are to be looked into. I understand that 49 more centres of consumer consultation are being set up, the cost of which, in due course, the local authorities will have to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment and I support the Government's proposal to abolish the other two committees, so long as there is full and proper consultation. From letters and representations that I have had, I know that in the past there has not been the fullest consultation. When there has been some radical alteration which has meant an immense amount of work for the meat industry or for the livestock auctioneers or some other interested body, suddenly the Ministry or the MLC has produced some suggestion out of a hat with very little consultation beforehand, saying that the deadline is 9th January when it is issued on Christmas Eve, or something like that, and there is no consultation or chance of consultation. All I say is that the wording "If it appears to the Commission" that it should consult all these people does not give me a great deal of confidence. I think that a duty should be laid upon the Commission to consult. I sincerely hope that we shall have reassurances on all these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take advantage, Mr. Costain, of the ruling you made earlier to divert a little from this group of amendments and make a few remarks about the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). In view of his criticism of the Meat and Livestock Commission, it is a pity that he was not with us on 16th April 1975 when, in the First Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments we discussed the Draft Meat
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
and Livestock Commission Levy (Variation) Scheme (Confirmation) Order 1975. We had the opportunity on that occasion of talking at length about the matters discussed this morning. With respect, my hon. Friend's remarks this morning would have been rather more appropriately made on that occasion than in relation to these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to pigs, about which we know my hon. Friend is such an expert, he said that the producer is paying the levy. He said that in the past some firms—I think he quoted Wall's—were doing that. I should point out to him that, before the Meat and Livestock Commission was set up, the Pig Industry Development Authority was in existence which, he will recall, was absorbed by the MLC. A levy was paid also to that body by producers, So, the MLC has not changed what was a fairly voluntary arrangement which was very successful at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of committing the mortal sin of repeating what I said last April, to underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said in his opening remarks, may I referring to the proceedings of the First Statutory Instruments Committee last April, when I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The commission estimates that the scheme costs"—</p></blockquote>
that is the pig improvement scheme—
	<br><blockquote><p>"around £200,000 a year and goes on to say that… the most conservative estimate shows that the industry currently derives an annual extra of well over £2 million through better feed conversion and improved carcase quality.'"</p></blockquote>
I went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is as a result of the work of the commission."—[OFFICIAL REPORT 	<i>First Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments,</i> 16th April 1975.; 	<i>cc.</i> 10-11.]</p></blockquote>
The paper goes into greater detail. I recommend my hon. Friend to look at that paper on the work of the pig improvement scheme, because one should be careful about making sweeping criticisms of the MLC which, in general, I believe justifies its existence. I know that hostility towards the existence of the MLC is felt by certain sections of the meat trade. A good deal of that derives from the onus which is put upon it to collect the levies, and I understand the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield read out some remarks which I made on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
Second Reading. There is no need for me to repeat them. But it appears to me that there is an adequate number of organisations which can be consulted on these matters, and that there is basically not much difference between the Consumers Committee and the other committees which it is proposed should be abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard) asked whether the abolition of the Production and Distribution committees would weaken the MLC. Her tone indicated that she thought that it would. My feeling is that, as my hon. Friend said, we have far too many of these odd consultative committees. People are paid to attend regular meetings, when sometimes there is nothing much to discuss. It is far better that the MLC should consult directly the organisations which are well known to represent the views of certain sections of the relevant industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a copy of a letter which was sent out by Mr. George Howard, the chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission, on 5th December. On page one of his letter, in paragraph 3.1, he laid down some suggestions on how the new consultation would operate. The part of that paragraph which appealed to me the most was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the essence of the new arrangements is flexibility."</p></blockquote>
I believe that there has not been enough flexibility in past committees. People travelled long distances to attend meetings of the Distribution Committee or Production Committee to find that the discussion was on a subject which did not necessarily affect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Distribution Committee, for example, there are three gentlemen who are livestock auctioneers, or who represent livestock auctioneers. I am sure that there must often have been meetings of the Distribution Committee where there was nothing of relevance to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the way in which the Distribution and Production Committees were formed. On the Production Committee there are five gentlemen who represent the pig producers. I am certain that there must have been meetings of the Production Committee when the problems of pig producers were not dealt with at any length. It would have been much more satisfactory to have individual meetings confined to matters of interest to the people who attended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman of the MLC is proposing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
that, if Parliament agrees to the Government's proposals:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will at times be appropriate that consultation should be at President/Chairman level."</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"at other times representatives of individual organisations will meet the Commission."</p></blockquote>
He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But the number of organisations to be designated by the Minister is so considerable that it will usually be appropriate to group them into panels."</p></blockquote>
One can understand that, and it exactly states the point which I have been trying to make. By grouping these organisations into panels, one is then having meetings or consultation only with groups of people who are particularly interested in the matter that one wants to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One therefore comes to the proposal to keep the Consumers Committee. I think that the Minister is proposing to pull the rug out from under his own feet, because Schedule I, Part Ill of the Agriculture Act 1967, which set up the Meat and Livestock Commission, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Consumers Committee shall consist of a chairman appointed by the Ministers and nine other members, and of those nine other members … six shall be persons appointed by the Ministers as capable of representing the interests of xsconsumers,…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>three shall be members of either the Production Committee or the Distribution Committee."</p></blockquote>
In the present proposals we are being asked to agree that the Consumers Committee shall be reduced from nine to six, and that the six members shall be persons appointed by the Ministers as persons capable of representing the interests of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the Minister proposing to abolish the Distribution and the Production Committees but he is taking away the advantage of having a voice put to the Consumers Committee from people who know about production and distribution. That is a strange thing to do. If the Minister agrees with his hon. Friend, that the Consumers Committee is going well at present, why do the Government take away from that committee members who represent other views and will give a breadth of view?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has many questions to answer. It would be helpful if he would tell us something about the present constitution of the Consumers Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am looking at the Report of the Meat
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
and Livestock Commission for the year ended 30th December 1974, which, as far as I am aware, is the most up to date. It is the most recent report that I have received. The Chairman of the Committee is Lord Cooper and there are nine other representatives, as the Act lays down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us who are the three members from other committees, who are the six people who represent the interests of consumers, and from what organisations they come. I imagine that they come, in general, from the organisations which I listed in my speech on Second Reading, as reported at column 1286 of 	<i>Hansard</i> for 1st December. It seems to me that we shall be in exactly the same situation as we have been in with the Production and Distribution Committees. For example, a representative from the Co-operative Women's Guild (Scottish Central Council) might come all the way to discuss matters at the Consumers Committee when there was perhaps nothing on the agenda specifically affecting the Scottish point of view. I accept that a person in such a role might well have interests in general matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a strange decision. The decision to reduce the size of the Consumers Committee at the same time is difficult. I know that these proposals have been applauded by certain sections. The National Farmers' Union is in favour of scrapping these two committees, but we are at a loss to understand why the Minister wants to retain the Consumers Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to do away with the Production and Distribution Committees of the MLC, the key questions are as follows. Which will be the designated organisations with which the MLC must consult? What notice will the MLC have to take of the views expressed by those organisations, whatever they may be? Presumably the MLC will not publish the views submitted to it. I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can foresee that the MLC will be in a stronger position than previously to have its own way. It is vital, therefore, that its various decision-making and executive bodies at all levels should have a very wide representative membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will make up the membership of the various other committees? Will it be from the consumer side, the production side, the meat trade or from any other organisations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate in keeping with your indication, Mr. Costain, about the basis of " clause stand part". There have been a number of questions which may come up in debates on later amendments, and I hope that the Committee will understand if I do not go too deeply into some of them. However, I shall do my best to elucidate the points which have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the views of the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), who, like his hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), believes in a free-market economy in agriculture as in other matters. I do not get that impression when the farmers and his hon. Friends demand that we intervene on more occasions, if only with a cheque, and in no other way. However, that is a form of interference which I think that he would appreciate from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also heard the views of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), who believes that it is right to end the Distribution and Production Committees, and that we should also end the Consumer Committee. He was counterbalanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard), who asked why we should end the two committees anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West believes in the free-market mechanism, without the interference of the MLC, which he deplores—unlike his hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield, who paid tribute to the MLC. The hon. Gentleman enlivened the proceedings briefly by talking about dating mechanism and computers. I thought that you might have ruled him out of order, Mr. Costain, but you may have recognised the connection. I was wondering whether he intended to link this to the relations between cows and bulls, and to say that the mechanism of nature should not be interfered with by the mechanism of man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will not get my hon. Friend wrong. He was referring to birds, a matter which I assume comes within the Committee's brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking only of the terms of the measure. If I were to go beyond the agriculture scene of cows and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
bulls I think that you would be on the horns of a dilemma, Mr. Costain, in trying to declare whether or not we were within the bounds of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to some of the substantial comments made on a wide range of subjects. If I do not fully deal with all the questions raised, I shall deal with them later in the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to alter the statutory arrangements for consumer consultation and to replace them with an arrangement similar to that proposed for the consultation with producers and distributors. It may be helpful to the Committee if I look at the situation under the 1967 Act, which provided for three statutory consultation committees—the Production Committee, the Distribution Committee and the Consumers Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Meat and Livestock Order was made in April 1975, it became apparent that the Commission and the organisations representing producers and distributors were not satisfied with the present consultation arrangements. That is why the whole consultation arrangement was reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognised that there were a number of consumer organisations, and consideration was given during the review to altering the consumer consultation provisions so that consumer groups would be consulted direct by the MLC—the point made by the hon. Member for Westmorland(Mr. Jopling). But, as existing arrangements appeared to be satisfactory and consumer interests safeguarded, no change was proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be seen from the list of people on the Consumers Committee that they come from various organisations representing consumer interests. The hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) asked for this information. The representatives are from the Housewife's Trust, the Consumers' Association, the National Federation of Consumer Groups, the Co-operative Union and the Scottish TUC. These people have been working on the Consumers Committee in a way which is thought by the MLC, the industry generally and the consumer groups to he satisfactory, and which we believe justifies the maintenance of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask one question about that list, and in particular, the Housewife's Trust. Can the Minister say whether it is still actively pursuing its

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
representations and its membership? My information is that this was an organisation set up as a virtual branch office of the European Movement to promote the idea that food would be much cheaper if we stayed in the Common Market than if we went out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to have to answer for the credentials of all the representative bodies. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is a member of the NFU—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might wonder why that organisation suggested that we should go into, and stay in, the Common Market. But it is not for me to enter a family quarrel between the hon. Gentleman and the organisations of which he considers it worth remaining a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am making is that the Consumers Committee is representative of a wide-ranging number of consumer organisations, the names of which I have given. The chairman, Lord Cooper of Stockton Heath, was a well-known trade unionist. I have no doubt that he adds weight to the representations from that committee, apart from being a member of the MLC itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there was a representative from the Scottish TUC. Are there representatives from Welsh organisations, as such?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. Clearly these organisations represent a wide range of people in various parts of the United Kingdom. I shall not comment too much on the organisations represented, except to say that they are widespread and cover many other interests, as well as smaller groups within the organisations themselves. I have no comment to make on the Housewife's Trust, but there may be some change of definition there in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act, and I should like not to suggest what its name might be in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the proposals before the Committee are those best suited to the industry, after widespread consulta tions with all the organisations concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted that last week the hon. Mem-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
ber for Macclesfield added weight to the Government's side by saying that the National Farmers'Union, which has also contacted both sides of the Committee—in common with other organisations in the livestock and meat industry some of which I have already referred to—is broadly in favour of the Bill and of the clause, which is designed to improve consultation between the MLC and the industry it serves. I go along entirely with the hon. Member on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not altogether clear why the hon. Member and one or two others are so keen to alter the arrangements for consulting consumer interests. I have heard no sound arguments for such a change. The organisations representing the producers and distributors have expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which their present statutory consultation arrangements work. I believe, with some confidence, that the new arrangements will work. I am unaware of any dissatisfaction among the consumer groups about the effectiveness of the present arrangements. That is another reason why we should hesitate before making the fundamental changes which the hon. Member has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our discussions here and on Second Reading we have all recognised how important it is that consumer interests should be fully heard. Indeed, the hon. Member for Westmorland himself said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"None of us on the Opposition side of the House has any desire to harm the position of consumers in these matters".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1286.]</p></blockquote>
He went on to ask why the Consumers Committee had been left alone, wondering whether it was because the Government did not think that there were adequate groups of consumers to consult. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary answered the point on Second Reading, when he said that there was no question of considering consumer groups to be inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for not altering the arrangements for consumer consultation is that a review of all the consultation arrangements showed that, alone of the three committees, the Consumers Committee was working well. There are a large number of competent organisations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
representing consumers. We recognise this, and we consult them on many topics. As I have said, the present list of representatives on the Consumers Committee is comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, no need to need to alter the arrangements for consumer consultation. I hope that hon. Members will not seek, in this so-called probing amendment, to make any changes which would in any way be to the disadvantage of the consumer interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some of the other points made by the hon. Member for Macclesfield. Having paid tribute to the MLC, which I echo, he raised the question of MLC economies. During 1974, the Commission set up a Finance and General Purposes Committee, composed of the Commission's chairman and deputy chairman and the chairmen of the three statutory committees, to consider every aspect of the Commission's work in detail. They concluded that the MLC work was both useful and cost-effective. As a result of their study, charges upon firms and individuals who have directly benefited from MLC services were increased. The Commission considerably trimmed its budget for 1975–76 and believes that any further cuts would seriously damage its programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of research by the MLC. This was one of the functions laid upon the Commission when it was set up, and the Government still think it right that an industry of this size should have a coordinating approach to the type of research which will be valuable to significantly large parts of the industry. The Commission, out of levy income raised from the industries and acting on the advice of its Research Committee, therefore finances and sponsors a major part of the work of the Meat Research Institute. It also sponsors postgraduate research at universities and institutes on problems of direct interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also raised a point about the advisory committees. I remind him that the Commission may set up any executive or advisory committee it requires. At present there are six such committees: three livestock committees—cattle, sheep and pigs—a Research Advisory Committee, an EEC Committee, and a Meat Promotion Executive
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
Committee. It is in such committees that technical developments are worked out in addition to any statutory arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will agree that the Meat Promotion Executive Committee to which he has just referred was set up by the trade, and it was agreed to by the MLC. It is important to note that this came from the trade rather than from the MLC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know the hon. Gentleman's point. But he will also recognise that this is another indication of the flexibility to which the Chairman of the MLC referred, and the need for it to be in close contact with the industry which it serves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also put a question about the position in Northern Ireland. I remind him that Northern Ireland has its own equivalent to the MLC. The Livestock Marketing Commission has been established there as an advisory body which performs many of the same functions as the Commission in Great Britain. Those functions which the MLC performs here as an agent of the Government are conducted in Northern Ireland by the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, and I understand that there is close liaison between the Northern Ireland Livestock Marketing Commission and the Meat and Livestock Commission of Great Britain, and there should be no fear that the activities of either of these Commissions would infringe the interests of the others. I hope that that reply gives him some assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside asked questions about consultation with the workers. The TUC and the relevant unions are consulted on the membership of the Consumers Committee and, as I said, Lord Cooper, the Chairman of the Committee and also a commissioner, is well qualified to look after that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned not only about consulting the workers as consumers but as producers in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, and I was about to come to it. Other hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells), have asked about the representation on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
the various committees. I have detailed the Consumers Committee, and I wanted to say that the Distribution Committee as at present made up includes the livestock traders, the livestock auctioneers, the local authorities operating slaughterhouses and livestock and meat markets, and persons engaged in animal byproducts. There are a number of organisations in these categories of representation. The Distribution Committee also includes wholesalers of meat and importers of meat excluding bacon, producers of bacon and other edible livestock products except meat, retailers of meat and other livestock products, and persons engaged in the marketing and distribution of livestock or the production, processing, manufacture, marketing and distribution of livestock products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this last category the Transport and General Workers' Union and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers are amongst the organisations which are consulted. These categories are in touch with other numerous groups and organisations which they consult. I have made a careful check of the Bill and the proposed Part HA to Schedule 1 of the 1967 Act gives a list of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Classes of Persons for Purposes of Section 1A".</p></blockquote>
This list includes all the categories which I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Production Committee includes cattle and sheep producers, pig producers, and persons involved in livestock production, and those three categories are the first categories on the list of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Classes of Persons for Purposes of Section 1A".</p></blockquote>
That means that identical interests, which are represented on the two committees which are to go, and are to be replaced by what I believe to be more effective consultation, will continue to be consulted and represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the claim by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston that the MLC has proved disappointing. As I said earlier, this is not what the industry thinks. Indeed, one of the results of our review was that no one wished to revert to the pre-1967 situation. The Government are satisfied that the Commission plays an important role in the affairs of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
the livestock and meat industry, providing services and influencing developments which would not occur if left to individual companies and producers. Although divergent interests of various sectors of the meat and livestock industry inevitably result in some activities of the Commission being criticised from time to time, I believe that the industry is now unanimous in recognising the need for the MLC. This is not an issue between the main parties in the House. Indeed, much of the confidence which needs to be built up and has been growing in the industry generally would be placed in jeopardy if there were to be free-for-all arrangements. I think the industry is well served by the work of the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West asked about the function of the MLC as a market information service. When the levy order was debated there was, as I said earlier, much criticism of the MLC's activities but its economic and market intelligence service to the industry received general acclaim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also questioned the growth of the MLC. The main costs of the MLC are on staff, and its record stands inspection. The total staff on 30th September 1974 was 1,250. This is not unreasonable when related to the extremely wide range of the Commission's activities shown in its report of that date. I am sure hon. Members have read the report and must have been impressed, as I was, by the great range of services given to the industry and to the consumer. Despite a tremendous increase in the scope of activities, the staffing figure compares favourably with the number given for September 1969, the first year of the Commission's operations, when it was 1,266.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member questioned the need for the Consumers Committee and said that it was time consuming and costly. I think the opposite is so. In some ways it can be much cheaper in time and money to consult with a representative group of consumers than to have to deal individually with all the organisations represented. We are changing the arrangements for the other Committees because the arrangements were found to be unsatisfactory, but this is not so with the Consumers Committee.

The hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) asked which would be the designated organisations. It is our

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
intention to designate those organisations which represent the interests of those classes of persons set out in Clause 3(3). They will be designated by Ministers. I cannot list them exhaustively, especially as we shall consult the Commission and the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main points in reply to questions asked by hon. Members. There may be one or two which will be duplicated in the debate on other amendments. These amendments have been useful in enabling us to explain some of the questions that hon. Members have asked. I hope that with the assurances I have given the amendments will be withdrawn and that we shall proceed with discussion on other aspects concerning consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very helpful debate. But in endeavouring to sum up my views on the Minister's reply I hope he will appreciate that my hon. Friends feel strongly on the points that we have made. I hope, too, that the Minister will note that his hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) remains deeply concerned that past consultation, relating to discussions, negotiations and consultations between the MLC and consumers, and the trade and industry itself, has been far from adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) touched upon an important point when he said that the Government have started to dismantle the floor from beneath their feet in relation to the retention of the Consumers Committee because the Bill, although re-establishing the Consumers Committee, cuts its numbers of members down from nine to a mere six. I appreciate that this is done because the Government have removed industrial organisation representation from the Committee. At the same time I believe that it undermines the basis for the need for the retention of the Committee because, in my view, the Minister has failed to answer the point that existing constructive and effective consumer organisations already exist outside this statutory committee which can negotiate on behalf of the consumer with the MLC and, if necessary, with the trade direct through the various trade organisations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
and, as the Government know, very effectively with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that the Government and the Minister would admit that the curtailment of the membership of the Consumers Committee is, if there is real weight behind the Government's argument, contrary to the principle of improved consultation, which is of increasing importance to the industry and to consumers. I feel that the Government have failed to justify the need for the retention of the committee. I have tried to hammer home the need for improved consultation. The Minister seemingly has partially taken it on board, but at the same time thinks that this additional statutory committee is already necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention wavered, in listening to the many points which the Minister had to cover in presenting the Government's case on the amendment, about exactly how the Consumers Committee is comprised. How does he choose what persons representing which organisations are to represent consumers on the committee? How often should the membership of the Committee be altered? Can the Minister indicate to the Committee what representations he has received from consumer organisations desiring and requesting the continuance of this committee, which the Opposition seek to phase out because we can see no useful purpose for its continuance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill in its present form, as I tried to describe earlier, is totally inadequate to achieve the aims of improved consultation between the MLC and the trade. The Bill clearly abandons what I describe as a well-defined consultation system, which I appreciate is now obsolete, by abolishing two statutory committees. That is supported by the trade, by the numerous organisations which have made representations to us—I repeat, the Meat Manufacturers' Association, the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers, the Smithfield Market Fresh Meat Traders' Association, the Association of British Abattoir Owners, and the National Farmers' Union. So much of what the Government are setting out to do is supported by the trade. But the trade also expresses its grave reservations about the consultation procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that there are about 40 organisations within the trade
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
which could, and should, be consulted by the MLC; and no doubt the Minister has himself received numerous representations. They are virtually all of the opinion that the Bill will not enable them to have positive and meaningful consultation. Perhaps I should say " consultation as of right ", because the Bill says that the Commission may consult
	<br><blockquote><p>"together or separately, or some together and others separately, as the Commission think fit".</p></blockquote>
This does not give trade organisations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I also draw attention to page 3, the first line of the proposed Section 1A(1)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Commission that any matter arising".</p></blockquote>
That does not seem to be a strong way for consultation to take place, because it is one-sided; that is, if it appears to the Commission and not to anyone else, unless I have missed reading something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to have my hon. Friend's support. He is entirely right, because the wording of the Bill is a recipe for ineffectual consultation by either piecemeal or mass consultation approach, and at best will lead to informative procedure rather than genuine consultation. I hope that the Minister of State will take this message on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill wrongly presupposes that the wholesale organisations are a unified body of tightly-knit associations with concurring views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting on to the next amendment with his remarks. There will be an opportunity to debate that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was looking for your continued discretion, Mr. Costain, to allow this first debate to be fairly wide-ranging, and that the subsequent debates—depending on your ruling and the contributions that my hon. Friends and hon. Members wish to make—will be relatively short and much more specific in their nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude this point, it is wrong to assume that wholesale organisations are a unified body of tightly-knit associations with entirely concurring views. They are in fact independent and democratic in outlook due, of course to their various
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
sectional requirements. As I have indicated, the Bill removes from the 1967 Act important consultative rights of the industries which have existed in the statutory committees which the Government, quite rightly, now seek to phase out. For instance—I again quote from the 1967 Act—the committees
	<br><blockquote><p>"may at any time submit proposals for the consideration of the Commission".</p></blockquote>
This means that trade organisations within the meat and livestock sector can at any time submit proposals to the MLC and
	<br><blockquote><p>"make representations to the Commission on any matter which in their opinion"—</p></blockquote>
not the opinion of the MLC—
	<br><blockquote><p>"has or i; likely to have a substantial effect"</p></blockquote>
on their interests. The committees can
	<br><blockquote><p>"give advice differing to any considerable extent from the advice of the majority".</p></blockquote>
That refers to the view of a particular sector of the meat and livestock industry which can make its views clearly known to the MLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document to which the Minister referred, issued by the chairman of the MLC, Mr. George Howard, setting out the means of consultation involving panels may, in the short term, produce a satisfactory consultative structure, but in the long term the Opposition feel that the Bill is inadequate to safeguard the interests of the trade, let alone improve consultation, which surely the Government must admit is one of the purposes of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is certainly inadequate as regards financial consultations, where it merely acknowledges the trade's wish to be kept informed and discuss with the Commission the accounts and budgets. I appreciate, Mr. Costain, that there is an amendment on this specific point, and at that stage we will clearly be able to enlarge on our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons I have just detailed, we have tabled a number of amendments which we believe will positively, and helpfully, improve the Bill and will guarantee the trade organisations, which I am sure the Minister will agree are important to the meat trade, the right to be consulted. These amendments will ensure that the trade organisations have the right to make representations to the MLC; not that the MLC, if it sees fit, may consult them; not that they may consider representations if the MLC sees fit to accept the representations; but that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
the trade with all its sectors and interests should have the right to make representations to the MLC. Otherwise—much mention has been made, and no doubt will be made, about the levy and the cost of the MLC—the meat and livestock trade interests will consider that the MLC is an emcumbrance, friction will arise, and the co-operation and positive consultation that we want to see will not take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have ranged quite widely in my summing up in response to the Minister's remarks and answers. I hope that he will appreciate that he must give somewhat more forthcoming replies to justify his insistence that the Consumers Committee should be retained, and perhaps indicate why he thinks the consultation procedures at present detailed in the Bill are satisfactory. Unless he can improve on the answers he has already given I feel it will be the wish of my hon. Friends to push these amendments to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has made that remark, because I believe the Minister misheard him earlier and appeared to get the impression that this is a probing amendment. These amendments were never intended to be in any way of a probing nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stick entirely to the question whether we should abolish the Consumers Committee. I wish to put specific questions to the Minister to which we must have answers. I first refer to points I made earlier as to why the Government are proposing to remove from the Consumers Committee those three representatives who, in the terms of the 1967 Act, are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of either the Production Committee or of the Distribution Committee and shall be appointed by the Commission".</p></blockquote>
In the list of names I have there are two people who are members of the Distribution Committee who are designated as retailers of meat and other edible livestock products. There is one gentleman who represents the interests of pig producers. Why does the Minister's proposal take out that type of representation from the Consumers Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot conceive that it is wise, if the Minister is determined to keep the Consumers Committee, to take the two retailers off the committee who, clearly,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
must have given good advice and, I imagine, were very helpful to those who represent more consumers' interests on the Consumers Committee. The Minister did not attempt to reply to that matter in his earlier speech. In my opinion, it completely pulls the rug from under the Government's own case. To put down a proposal whereby the two retail butchers on the committee are removed, immediately takes away a good deal of what value there is in the Consumers Committee. We must have justification for that action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which the Minister did not deal with fully, and to which we must have an answer, was that he was kind enough to tell us the organisations from which the six members of the Consumers Committee came. We should like his confirmation that those members are not there as delegates but are there representing themselves. There is nothing in the 1967 Act to say that the representative of the Housewife's Trust, for example, should be there to represent the interests of the Housewife's Trust. As I understand it, that lady is there to represent herself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mandate in the 1967 Act gives the Minister power to appoint six persons capable of representing the interests of consumers. As I understand the Act, it is no part of the duties of those members of the Consumers Committee to be a mouthpiece for the organisations from which they come Indeed, that has been one of the criticisims of the present Distribution Committee and the Production Committee. It was felt by some organisations that the members on those committees did not reflect adequately the views of the bodies to which they were perhaps best known in their public activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the six members of the Consumers Committee who are capable of representing the interests of consumers, there is one from the Housewife's Trust, two from the Consumers' Association, one from the National Federation of Consumer Groups, one from the Cooperative Union Ltd., and one from the Scottish TUC. That takes me back to the list which I read out on Second Reading of the organisations which the Ministry has consulted recently. The Minister will recall the hand-out of 20th November, where they were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
consulting various representatives of consumers' organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that one or two groups listed there are not represented on the Consumers Committee of the Meat and Livestock Commission. As far as I can see, no one on that committee represents the National Consumer Council. There is no one who represents the Co-operative Women's Guild, and there is no one who represents the Co-operative Women's Guild (Scottish Central Council). I suppose that the Minister is saying to the consumers' organisations " According to our proposal, we will continue not to have people on the Consumers Committee who are representatives or who are members of the National Consumer Council and the two Co-operative Women's Guilds."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our amendment is accepted, it will immediately give an increased voice to those three organisations. That leads me to ask the Minister whether he has consulted all those representatives of consumer interests who are referred to in the Minister's hand-out of 20th November. After all, that hand-out referred to important matters. The representatives met at that time to discuss:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…food and agricultural production and support policy in connection with the Annual Review of the agricultural industry.—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1286.]</p></blockquote>
That is an important matter to consumers, as I am sure the Minister will accept. Has he consulted all the groups referred to in the hand-out of 20th November? Has he said to them " Would you prefer to continue to have people chosen by the Minister from some of your organisations on the Consumers Committee? Or would you like us to scrap the Consumers Committee of the Meat and Livestock Commission? Would you prefer to do that, and we will write into the statute that we will, as of right, consult all of your organisations as the head?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the position in which some of the organisations referred to in the proposed new Part IIA find themselves. They are in the happy position now that they know that those organisations are to be consulted at the head by the Meat and Livestock Commission. Has that proposition been put to all these consumer groups by the Government? If the Government have not consulted them, it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
has a serious implication for what we are discussing. In that case, those consumer groups have not had the option to be consulted in more realistic terms than they are being consulted now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend indicate whether he considers that the Government's approach to this matter is totally inconsistent? On the one hand, they seek to reduce the number of members of the Consumers Committee at a time when consultation with the industry and with individuals is more important than ever, particularly because of the advent of meat promotion—something relatively new. On the other hand, by having a Consumers Committee which is very restricted in its membership, they are preventing a number of effective and useful consumer organisations from making representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts my case very well. That is exactly what I feel. I ask the Committee to consider the position of an individual citizen who, let us say, is a member of the Housewife's Trust or the Consumers' Association. That member has to ask himself or herself "Would I rather my voice was listened to by the Meat and Livestock Commission through a senior member of my organisation who is nominated to the Consumers Committee, although he has no mandate whatsoever to stick to the line which my organisation believes in, or would I rather that the Meat and Livestock Commission came to the officers of my organisation and conferred direct with them?" I suspect that the vast majority of members of those organisations would prefer the latter course. I imagine that they would feel that their voice was being heard infinitely more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must answer these questions. There are two particular matters that we must know about. As my hon. Friend rightly said, unless we can get some satisfaction it would be only right for us to invite the Committee to divide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more I listen to the debate, the more concerned I become about the question of consultation. Opposition Members seem to be arguing in contradiction. They argue for the removal of the Consumers Committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
then they argue for retailers to be left on that committee, when it seems to me that the appropriate committee for retailers would have been the Distribution Committee. They express alarm that, although the Commission may decide to consult various organisations, it does not have to do it. I agree with that point. Surely the best way to make certain that the various organisations, and particularly people who work in the industry, are consulted, is to keep the Production and Distribution Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), said that it would be better to go direct to the organisations. I agree, but obviously we shall not achieve that. It would mean fantastically long consultations. We should have to go to every organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister said that, although the Production and Distribution Committees are to be done away with, all the organisations represented on them will still he consulted. If they are to be consulted—and I am not convinced that they are—surely the most sensible and efficient way to consult them would be through those two committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with some of my hon. Friend's comments. She is right to say that there is a great deal of confusion among the Opposition. There have been as many views expressed as there have been hon. Members taking part in the debate. I am still not clear whether they are happy about the two committees being disbanded, and the Consumers Committee being retained, or whether they want the Consumers Committee to go the same way as the other two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation is clear. The meat and livestock industry and trade are unanimous in the view, shared by the Ministry and the Minister, that the Distribution and Production Committees, which must be fairly limited in their membership, have not been able to operate effectively, and that various interests within the trade have been overlooked by the MLC in the past. The MLC admits it, the Ministry admits it and the industry and trade admit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition support the Government in the abolition of the Distribution and Production Committees. We are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
unanimous. Not one voice has spoken out against my line that the Consumers Committee is unnecessary and should be phased out. There are more effective ways. Just as there are more effective ways for the trade to negotiate with and consult the MLC, consumers can similarly, through their effective, constructive and thoroughly respected organisations, consult and negotiate direct with the MLC, as they do with the Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 44 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission shall, on any matter which in their opinion has, or is likely to have, a substantial effect on the interests of consumers, consult any existing consumer organisation".</p></blockquote>
That can mean some of them, as the Commission may think fit, or all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) put a point of view which was rather critical of the trade. He seems to think not only that the MLC should consult the organisations—the ones which are now represented on the Distribution and Production Committees—but that it would be far better if it were to go to executive meetings to get the views of the organisations. The chairman of the MLC, and other commissioners who may be acting for the Commission, would have an enormous job travelling round the country seeing every organisation which thinks it should be seen, and not only the organisation but the executive committee. This suggestion casts a slur upon the nominees of these organisations. It would seem that we do not trust what they say, and that we want to attend the organisations themselves to hear precisely what they have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the hon. Member for Macclesfield's hon. Friends questioned the organisation of the MLC, its efficiency and so on. I can exonerate the hon. Member from the charge of making that criticism, but the hon. Members for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) and Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) were a little critical of the MLC. They spoke about its efficiency. It is right that we should want an efficient organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was critical of the principle of these boards, commissions and so on being set up, but I praised the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
way in which much of the work was done. I criticised all organisations of this nature for spreading their wings. Therefore, I was grateful that the Government were suggesting the cutting out of a certain amount of top-heavy administration. We thought that we should also support the abolition of the Consumers Committee and its replacement by better and more direct consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was exactly my point. Obviously, I did not put it very clearly, or perhaps the Minister's attention wavered for a moment. I was not criticising. I thought that I paid tribute to the leadership of the MLC, and to the very gifted chairmen who have presided over it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Holland with Boston. I may have been influenced by the undertones of having read his Selsdon Man pamphlet on agriculture. I had the impression from that he was not happy with the present situation. Shall I unite the Committee by saying that I am sure that every hon. Member present has a concern that the MLC should be run as efficiently and economically as possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I am sure that some of the ideas put forward by Opposition Members are not in line with that aspiration. We want consultation, but the amendments would not put consumers in the same position as producers and distributors. Whereas the Bill provides for producer and distributor interests to be consulted through designated organisations, the amendments, in so far as they provide new consultation arrangements for consumers, would require the Commission to consult all consumer organisations that already exist. That would not be satisfactory. It would place an undue burden on the Commission and its staff. Furthermore, as consumer organisations will tend to have similar interests in MLC activities, there will be no gain to consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point to bear in mind is that consumers retain the right under the Bill to make representations to the Commission. The Consumers Committee has members who have a substantial representative role in passing on the comments of the organisations they represent. The organisations—the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
National Federation of Consumer Groups, for instance—obviously represent many more groups. I do not know whether the hon. Member wishes the MLC to consult all these groups individually. But as there has been general consent that the arrangements we are trying to change were not working all that well, and there is general consent that the new arrangements are satisfactory, I should have thought that that was good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked how the Consumers Committee is selected and how often it is altered. The members are appointed for three years, selected from the consumer organisations for their ability to represent effectively the interests of their consumer group. These organisations are invited to submit nominees. All members are chosen from those names, so the organisations themselves decide who is to represent them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked whether the members of the committee were delegates or representatives. I do not know the representative functions of the people on the committee, but the organisations have an opportunity to be critical of the way in which they are represented and have the right to change their nominees if they do not do the job which they ought to do. I think that I have answered the question whether the committee nominees are mouthpieces for the organisations, or whether they represent themselves. Under the 1967 Act they are appointed as representing the interests of their organisations, and before their appointment Ministers consult the relevant organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where does the 1967 Act say that these people are appointed to represent the views of their organisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that Part III of Schedule 1 refers to supplementary provisions with respect to the Commission's activities. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Ministers before appointing a person to be a member of the Production Committee as capable of representing the interests of any class of persons shall consult such organisations as appear to them appropriate as renresenting those interests, taking account of interests in Scotland as well as in England and Wales".</p></blockquote>
The Consumers Committee is also defined, as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Consumers Committee shall consist of a chairman appointed by the Ministers and nine other members, and of those nine other members—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
	<ol>
	<li>six shall be persons appointed by the Ministers as capable of representing the interests of consumers,</li>
	<li>three shall be members of either the Production Committee or of the Distribution Committee and shall be appointed by the Commission".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for reading that out. In fact, I had read it out earlier, but it is not what the hon. Gentleman said, and it is not what I asked. A few moments ago the Minister said that these people were appointed as capable of representing the interests of their organisations. That is precisely why I interrupted him, because, as I understand it, that is precisely what they are not appointed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are appointed to represent the interests of livestock traders or livestock auctioneers, but they are not elected to represent the views of individual organisations. They may be appointed to represent the interests of consumers, or producers, but they are not appointed to represent the views of individual organisations. That is what the Minister said. That is precisely my point. It is precisely what they are not appointed under the statute to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where we are getting. This is really splitting hairs. There are as many consumers as there are people in our population. If there are consumer groups which consumers see fit to set up and sustain, to put forward their view-point, it is surely logical to say that the people who are appointed represent their point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members are here because they are elected by their constituents to represent them. I should not like to quote Burke about the way in which we should do our job of representation or speak for those we are supposed to represent. But it is splitting hairs to say that I should not have talked about representing consumer groups when the Act talks about representing the interests of consumers. What are all these groups doing if they do not represent consumers, or distributors, the producers, the livestock people and the rest? It is preposterous to suggest that these people should not represent consumers. Of course they represent consumers. The groups formed by the consumers to be their mouthpiece have the opportunity of changing their representatives from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
time to time if it is felt that they are not doing the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal here would take consultation too far, and there would be enermous cost involved in ensuring that the people who claimed to speak for a body were doing so. If the Minister, the MLC or the commissioners had to go right down to the grass roots to see whether the representation was fair and proper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give a moment's attention to Amendment No. 44, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission shall, on any matter which in their opinion has, or is likely to have, a substantial effect on the interests of consumers, consult any existing consumer organisations".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps that is not as specific and binding as the commitment which we wish to put into the Bill where trade interests are concerned, but it surely means that there shall be a duty imposed upon the MLC to consult any 	<i>bona fide</i> consumer organisation, but not every consumer, or every consumer organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that having to reply time and again to these matters may be a little frustrating for the Minister, but we are trying to be responsible and reasonable, and we consider that the proposed composition of the Consumers Committee is too narrow. There are some effective and useful organisations representing consumers which do not have the right to nominate a representative to sit on the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends ask about the effectiveness of new consultation arrangements. The Bill provides for consulting organisations in all sectors and giving them a chance to put their views. The Consumers Committee represents a limited number of organisations, but those organisations represent a great web of other consumer groups throughout the country. The committee is at the very top of the pyramid of consumer groups. Moreover, its chairman, who is a commissioner, has the opportunity to put its collective view to the Commission direct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point of view was expressed when I was asked why the chairmen of the Distribution Committee and the Production Committee were not represented on the consumer group. The basic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
answer is that they have a voice direct on the Commission in the same way as the chairman of the consumer group has. Because the members of the consumer group are not on the Commission, they must have a spokesman. But the trade already has the benefit of representatives on the Commission—not just the chairman—and the Commission has a duty under this measure to be in contact with all the organisations which are at present represented on the MLC and which will, in future be represented by direct contact with the MLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might say a word about the Consumers Committee changes. Basically, the committee's position will remain as it was. The 1967 Act provides for the committee to consist of a chairman and nine other members, six of whom are appointed by Ministers as being capable of representing the interests of consumers, and three of whom are appointed by the Commission from members of the Production and Distribution Committees. However, because the statutory Production and Distribution Committees are to be abolished, it will no longer be possible, of course, for these representatives to serve on the Consumers Committee. But I have made the point that these interests will have direct representation on the MLC itself. This, I think, is the answer to the points which have been made. I may be straying on to the next amendment if I go on too far—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman certainly would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and I would hate to incur your criticism on that point, Mr. Costain. But I recognise the real concern of the Opposition and, indeed, of my hon. Friends, about the adequacy of any consultation arrangements. I would only repeat that, from the debate in April of last year, and with the consultations which have taken place since with the MLC, the NFU and many other organisations, it is apparent that there is general agreement that the new scheme will commend itself to the distributive trades, the producers, and the consumers. The Committee would be well advised to allow the clause to remain as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
many questions which are not answered. The Minister has not been as helpful this morning as he normally is. He spent far too much time in his last speech trying to nit-pick between the various things that have been said on this side. He did not deal with the problems which we have raised and with what we have asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said—to take my first point first—that he has taken the representatives of production and distribution interests out of the Consumers Committee because those interests are already represented in the Commission. That was his argument. But that was not the point at all. We want to know what the Government's justification is for removing from within the Consumers Committee advice which has been given in the past by two gentlemen who represented retailers of meat and one who represented pig producers. The Minister has not attempted to answer that. We have said that we think there is even more reason to abolish the Consumers Committee if the Government are determined to remove those other three representatives from it. Will, then, the Minister consider for Report putting down an amendment—there is still time, if it goes down today—to restore that figure of nine which was in the 1967 Act, so that the Consumers Committee could still have the advantage of advice within its meetings from the retail trade and other production interests? The Minister has not attempted to justify depriving the Consumers Committee of that advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other question which the Minister did not attempt to answer was with regard to those groups which are not represented, from the consumers' point of view, on the Consumers Committee. He did not attempt to answer my question whether the consumer groups have all been consulted to see which they would have preferred. It is significant that not one of the speeches which were made from either side of the Committee this morning attempted to destroy our arguments about substituting the Consumers Committee for consultation with consumer interests for the Production and Distribution Committees set-up. Our main arguments for abolishing the Consumers Committee have been met with no criticism from either side of the Committee. That is significant. We must
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
ask the Minister whether these consumer groups have been consulted. Have they been given the option of deciding which they would prefer: to go on as they were, or to move over to a system of consultation in the same way that the production and distribution interests are to have under the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important questions, and if the Minister cannot tell us whether he has given an option to consumer groups to take the same step as has been taken by other groups, it puts the Committee in a great difficulty. Therefore, the Minister must be prepared to take the matter away and give us an undertaking that he will reconsider these points with a view to making amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is that the amendment be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just consulting, Mr. Costain. I have already said that because the two groups are being ended their representatives will go as well. It will no longer be possible for the representation on those two committees to be continued on the Consumers Committee. In theory, it may be wondered whether it would be possible for additional appointments to the Consumers Committee to represent the interests of the bodies to which the hon. Member has referred. But in practice this would perform no useful purpose. Under the new arrangement there will be much more flexibility for consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Consumers Committee will remain a statutory committee does not give it any greater powers than would exist for other interests. It is a misconception that a</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>committee consisting of only six consumer representatives would have its influence increased. The consumer interests will have their representations as previously and the influence of the other interests will be channelled through the new flexible arrangements. The interests are represented on the Commission.</p>
	<p>The Consumers Committee is selected from the names put forward by all the national consumer organisations. The hon. Member asked whether consumer groups had been consulted. It should be borne in mind that the Consumers Committee has been kept fully informed and is representative of the many consumer organisations.</p>
	<p>Without going too far into the other amendments which are to follow, the substantial debate that we have had this morning may be justified and the majority of the Committee will be satis-fled that in these matters the Bill should remain as drafted.</p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 14, in page 3, line 21, after "Act" insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or if it appears to the relevant organisation or each of the relevant organisations that any such matter has, or is likely to have, such an effect".</p></blockquote>
I think we can say that on that first group of amendments we have had a useful and far-reaching debate which I feel has been helpful to our future debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to the right of trade organisations to be consulted by the Commission. Much of the argument has already been presented in the earlier debate, so I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer back to something I mentioned in my earlier speech, namely, the application to Parliament by the Commission for an increase in the maxima of levy. The matter was debated in Parliament on 16th April last year. During that debate it was conceded that there should be an examination by officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. That examination was a useful and positive exercise. Evidence was collected from a large number of trade organisations. No doubt many members of the Committee will have received a copy of the summary of the evidence submitted to that examination by, among others, the National Council of the Association of Fresh Meat Wholesalers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusions of the examination were as follow, though no doubt I shall be repeating some of the words already spoken by the Minister of State. There is, indeed, a requirement for the MLC. But, secondly—I think this was a unanimous decision of those involved in the examination—it was agreed that consultations in the past between the trade organisations and the meat and livestock industry and the MLC had not been successful within the existing framework. There was a real requirement for more genuine consultation, particularly on matters of finance and long-term projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled amendments to Clause 3 because the Opposition members of the Committee do not believe that the Bill in its present form is adequate in that it dismantles two statutory committees whose members were appointed by Ministers and substitutes a much
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
looser arrangement involving negotiations with trade organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said already, the Chairman of the MLC issued a statement setting out a means of more positive and more meaningful consultation involving the setting up of people. In the short term, that may produce the sort of consultative structure that the trade organisations which have made representations to us seek. But in the long term, to safeguard their membership and their interests, the trade organisations—they have said so very forcibly in their representations—feel that our amendments should be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the document issued by the Chairman of the MLC is totally inadequate as regards financial consultations. It suggests that discussions only should take place. The trade quite rightly feels that there should be a mandatory requirement for the Commission to consult the industry on finance, not just to hold discussions. That is far too weak. It does not give the trade organisations the opportunity that they desire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important. It is being taken on its own. I hope that the Minister, in dealing with it, will be a little more sensitive and will not stick quite so religiously to the brief provided by his permanent civil servants. There is no doubt that without the mandatory duty written into the Bill the trade organisations within the meat and livestock industry will not feel that the Bill has achieved anything for them. In fact, with the abolition of the Production and Distribution Committees perhaps they will rightly feel that their opportunity of influencing the decisions of the MLC has been reduced rather than increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall naturally wish to say a little more when the Minister has had an opportunity to reply to this straightforward presentation of the case that there should be a mandatory duty written into this clause, so that organisations have the right to be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend on this point. I know that the MLC wishes this consultation, as does the Ministry wish it to be carried out, but I do not believe that the words in the Bill put any emphasis on the con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
sultation sufficiently strong enough. I shall again read from the proposed new Section 1A:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Commission that any matter … has or is likely to have a substantial effect on the interests …"</p></blockquote>
Interests which various organisations have known whether it has a substantial effect upon them. It should not be up to the Commission to decide whether there is a substantial effect. As my hon. Friend has said, there should be a mandatory duty upon the Commission to consult. The idea behind it is probably right, and what the Chairman of the MLC said sounds good, but, nevertheless, it would give great reassurance to the various bodies connected with the meat trade in one form or another if something along these lines were written into the Bill. Experience during past years in many ways has left them with a feeling of not having had sufficient time to consult their constituent body when they first hear of something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows that livestock auctioneers throughout Scotland, England and Wales are busy people—as we all are—and no one can expect to receive at headquarters notification of some proposal and then, without more than a month's notice of a definite proposal, be able to get the feeling. We must not have these deadlines which too often have been put in suggested alterations to the rules and regulations before consultation takes place. Everything is done in a rush in order to beat that deadline, and often one does not get the proper consultation and, as a result, one does not get the right solution. There should be consultation. It should be early. It should be full and thorough and written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an extension of the discussion we had on the earlier group of amendments. The Committee might read again what Clause 3(2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Commission that any matter arising or likely to arise out of the exercise of the Commission's function has or is likely to have a substantial effect on the interests of one or more classes of persons mentioned in Part IIA of Schedule I to this Act, the Commission shall consult the relevant organisation or each of the relevant organisations about the matter; and where a number of organisations fall to be consulted under this subsection about any such matter. The commission may consult them together,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
or separately, or some together and others separately, as the Commission think 	<i>fit."</i></p></blockquote>
I would have thought that was a very adequate form of consultation. Indeed, many people might say that this would involve the Commission in an enormous amount of work in order to carry out its function. The first few words are—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Commission …"</p></blockquote>
What is the Commission? It is not a remote autonomous body; it is made up of representatives of the interests of the consumers, the distributors, and the producers. So the Commission itself is a body alive with the spirit of consultation, and indeed its members are representatives—I had better be careful, in view of the comments made by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling): I must not say that they represent organisations, because under the 1967 Act they have to represent the consumers, the distributors and the producers. So that is already in the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) goes on with his amendment. It seeks to add, about classes of persons mentioned to be consulted,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or if it appears to the relevant organisation or each of the relevant organisations that any such matter has, or is likely to have, such an effect".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member says it is not good enough for it to appear to the Commission that people should be consulted; he wants it the other way round, that the Commission has a duty to consult the relevant organisations, whatever " relevant organisations " may mean. It may, of course, consult hundreds of organisations and still find one or two which think themselves relevant but which it has not consulted for some reason or other. It may not know of their existence. Under the amendment the Commission would have a duty to consult those relevant organisations if it appeared to them that they should be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister of State, and no doubt also the Chairman of the MLC, will not claim to be infallible. Here we are clearly stating that the relevant trade organisation should have the right to make representations to the MLC; not that the MLC, may consult only if it sees fit. As my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
said, the MLC may well not see fit, but a trade organisation will see fit. We consider, in the interests of the trade, that it should be written into the Bill that they have the right to make representations to the MLC. I can see nothing wrong in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sensitive to the hon. Member's point about my infallibility. I am only a Bishop, so I cannot claim to be on those levels of responsibility or divine guidance where I might go further than that. The Committee will certainly not lack a sense of my fallibility, although I admit that I am pleased with the way in which the Committee responded to my last set of proposals by its vote. But I do take the hon. Member's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the matters the hon. Member raised in his opening remarks. We realise that, given the rather unsatisfactory experience of the present consultation arrangements to which I have referred, the industries are now looking for arrangements which will give them almost cast-iron guarantees of making their views known to the Commission. This is virtually what we are doing in the Bill. I do not think it would be reasonable to envisage the Commission itself failing to identify an interest. We have members on the Commission who are sensitive to all the interests in which the Commission is involved and who will want to know whether all these bodies and interests have been consulted, long before any decision has to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission and the industries are in continual contact. One has only to telephone or write a letter to register that he considers his interests are affected by the Commission. Under these proposed provisions that situation is strengthened. Under existing arrangements, because the Production and Distribution Committees are statutory bodies, what they could do must be laid down by statute. The present proposals will give organisations much more freedom than in the past. The whole point of abolishing the Production Committee and the Distribution Committee is to strengthen the degree of representation for such organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talks about the inadequacy of the MLC proposals for financial discussions. These discussions
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
are to be dealt with in later amendments, and I will restrain myself from putting forward the very good case I can make until the time comes. If the amendment is accepted, the Commission will be obliged to consult relevant organisations—we are not sure who the relevant organisations are—when they want to be consulted. That would place an unreasonable burden on the Commission which, after all, must retain independence in the way that it does its job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat disappointed at the Minister's insensitive reply. I assume from what he said that he is happy with the Bill as it is drafted and that he feels that the interests that I am trying to safeguard by this amendment will be fully taken into account. If that is the case, I see no reason why he cannot acept this amendment, which would write into the Bill the safeguard that the industry wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not received one representation from a trade organisation that does not fully endorse Amendment No. 14. I believe that this amendment—the Minister has not persuaded me otherwise—could only improve the Bill, and would indicate to trade organisations that the MLC was genuinely interested in having positive and genuine consultation with them. If the MLC has any oversight at any time, relevant organisations can have the right to make representations to the MLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) requires the Commission to consult organisations, if it appears that such consultation is called for. The Bill does not, therefore, provide in detail for the mechanics of consultation. More importantly, it cannot lay down how the MLC is to judge when to consult. Therefore, to some degree there is quite an area of doubt and, although I fully agree that the MLC is not purposely going to avoid consulting with any interested party, I am convinced that there will be occasions when, by an oversight, trade organisations who should have been consulted are not consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, therefore. as the Bill is drafted it could mean that matters important to trades would not be the subject of consultation. It is the unanimous view of the Opposition that the Bill requires amendment. This is a constructive amendment, not a destructive amendment, which would write a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
safeguard into the Bill that is required by every trade organisation—there have been many—which has made representations to the Opposition. I am sure that these trades have also made their views known to the Minister. We shall, therefore, certainly push this amendment to a Division, and in doing so we believe we are fully representing the best interests of the trades and also trying to improve the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
