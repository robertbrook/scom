	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—(15th January)</i>—No. 14, in page 3, line 21, after "Act" to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or if it appears to the relevant organisation or each of the relevant organisations that any such matter has, or is likely to have, such an effect."—	<i>[Mr. Nicholas Winterton.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the termination of our proceedings last Thursday I had risen to my feet to support my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) on the amendment. I hope that the Government will pay serious attention to what my hon. Friend said. They have had a number of days in which to ponder over those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment raises an important matter to those of us who have been interested in the affairs of the Commission for many years. I speak as one who spoke on Second Reading and who took a full part in the proceedings on the 1967 Act. Part of the Committee stage of that Bill took place before the 1966 General Election and the whole thing had to be gone through again when the new Parliament met after the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something that has been a cloud on the horizon always for the Commission has been the attitude of some of the meat trade to its operations and proceedings. There have been times when the meat trade has been on a good point and other times when it has been on a less good point. However, the confidence that has existed between the meat trade and the Commission has left something to be desired. That is a great pity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
I believe strongly in the MLC and I expressed my views fully in the debate we had on these matters last summer, when we discussed the levy of the MLC. I am anxious that everything possible be done to improve the relations which exist between the Commission and the various trade bodies with which it has to deal. I believe that would be for the benefit of everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would go some way down the line towards that end. It would secure that, if any of the relevant organisations named in the Bill felt that there were matters which it would like to have representations and meetings about, it would have the right to raise those matters and have them considered. That is what the amendment is all about. I believe that it would go some way to lifting this rather unfortunate feeling that exists between the meat trade and the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time it would mean that if any of the producer interests wished to raise any of these matters there would be consultation on those as well. It is principally for the meat trade that I see the benefit of the amendment. When the Minister replies I hope that he will be able to tell us that the Government are able to support it. Naturally we understand that our drafting is fallible. If the Minister were to say that he accepts the amendment in principle and that the Government will table an amendment on Report, that would be entirely satisfactory. I hope that we shall receive sympathy from the Government on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to be very lavish in dealing out sympathy today, but at the end of the day I do not know whether hon. Members opposite will be satisfied that my sympathy is enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Opposition and the Committee that all matters which we discuss are carefully considered between sittings and amendments are given a great deal of thought. Indeed, if one can possibly accept the line that is put forward, one seeks to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are occasions, such as now, when one must be sensitive to the facts of the situation and have the interests of the industry at heart. The purpose of the amendment is to give each relevant organisation the right to bê
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
consulted when it considers the interests of the class of persons it represents to be affected by the commission's activities. As I said last week, this is an amendment which would be inserted in a clause which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Commission that any matter arising or likely to arise out of the exercise of the Commission's functions has or is likely to have a substantial effect on the interests of one or more classes of persons mentioned … the Commission shall consult."</p></blockquote>
The Commission, therefore, has the duty laid upon it by Parliament to ensure that there are consultations in any areas where its functions are likely to have a substantial effect on the interests of those concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last time we met hon. Members expressed concern that the opening words of the proposed new Section 1A of the 1967 Act, which I have just quoted, place upon the Commission the responsibility for identifying matters on which it must consult, and whom it should consult about these matters. This would place on the Commission the same obligation towards the relevant organisations as at present applies to the statutory Production and Distribution Committees. This obligation must rest with the Commission which alone is in the position to identify where its activities are likely to affect such interests. The Commission, doing the job in the very able way we know it does, is in a position to be sensitive to those interests which might be affected by any of its workings or policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said that some industry organisations were concerned that the provision in the 1967 Act for the Production and Distribution Committees to submit proposals on the exercise of the Commission's functions, or to make representations on matters affecting the interests of producers and distributors, were not similarly spelt out in the arrangements envisaged in the Bill to introduce direct consultation with relevant organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that this arises from a misunderstanding of the new situation which this clause would create. So long as this consultation with interested parties has to be conducted through committees created by statute, it is also necessary to provide for the rights and the obli-
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
gations of those bodies by statute. In the new situation there is no need to legislate for this right. The designated organisations will be free to make representations to the MLC and, because there will be a statutory duty on the Commission to consult those organisations, they would be, if anything, in a stronger position than they were previously. That is because the two statutory committees will disappear and the organisations—I believe there are about 40 at the moment—will all have contact with the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I assume correctly from the Minister's remarks that, if a trade organisation within the meat and livestock industry thought fit to submit a paper to the MLC on a particular mattter which was being considered by the MLC, there would be a duty for the MLC to consider that paper; or could the MLC disregard that paper and not give it consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised that question, because I was about to come on to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, nothing in the proposed clause as it stands would exclude the right of any interested person or organisation—whether for the time being designated or not—from making its point of view known to the Commission, either privately or publicly. So there is this flow between the Commission and the organisations which may be concerned. On that score alone the amendment is inappropriate and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point I wish to make is that the MLC is set up as an independent body to do a job which embraces a wide range of functions. There would be a danger in placing an obligation on the Commission to consult an organisation—whenever that organisation wished—on each and every matter which it chose to claim might affect its interests. It could enable any organisation wishing to hamper the development of the MLC function to paralyse MLC progress in any given sphere—possibly to the detriment of wider interests of others in the industry who would stand to benefit from the activity in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With no statutory committees standing between them and the Commission, the producers and distributors organisations will be given much more freedom and it would be counter-productive to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
make statutory provisions for their rights in this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would emphasise again that the answer to the question "Should an organisation submit papers on certain matters, would the MLC be bound to consult?" is "Yes," if the matter in question could truthfully be said to have a substantial effect on the interests of the class of person that the organisation represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the amendment is quite unnecessary. I appreciate the concern of hon. Members on this matter, but in the debate on the MLC levy on 16th April my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The MLC has also suggested that the consultative arrangements with the meat and livestock industries could, with advantage, be reconsidered. Ministers are, therefore, asking officials, in consultation with the Meat and Livestock Commission and with the trade associations, to examine further the views which have been expressed and to report to the Ministers on the results of their discussions."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>First Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments,</i> 16th April 1975, c. 9.]</p></blockquote>
In Clause 3 we are discussing what has happened since to strengthen the consultations between the Commission and those represented. It has been indicated that the Commission and those it represents are satisfied with these arrangements. I feel confident that the new arrangements whereby the MLC will be in constant touch with the many designated organisations will improve the structure of consultation, which was the basis of criticism at the time of the last levy debate and has been since. So there will be a two-way flow between those concerned and, at the same time, there will be none of the hindrances which might come about and which, I am sure, would come about if the amendment was accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that after this very full debate the mover of the amendment will see fit to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Member one question? He said so many words, somewhat rapidly, that I am sure if he made clear whether consultation will be properly undertaken. I have had many examples from Ministries of all hues—it is not a party matter at all—and Government bodies which think that they are consulting organisations when they throw an idea at them and say that
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
they want a reply in three or four weeks' time. Those organisations have to consult their constituent bodies up and down the country if it is suggested that trade practices should be altered in one way or another. May I have the Minister's absolute assurance that it means real consultation, in the proper meaning of the word, and not just the issue of an edict saying "Here is what we are going to do. You can make comments if you like, but this is the time in which it is to be done", with, in effect, no notice being taken of the consultation at all? That is something that does happen. It continues to happen. I agree that it has not happened under the present régime, but the same good people are not always in charge. So I want the Minister's assurance on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Member's concern that consultation on any submissions should be genuine. If representations were made by an organisation to the MLC, the MLC would have to have good reasons for refusing to consult that organisation. The MLC is primarily responsible for deciding when the relevant interests are affected. That does not mean that the MLC is permitted to refuse consultation for irrelevant reasons or capriciously. I take the hon. Member's point that consultation should be genuine. Of course, there has to be a limit. One cannot go on consulting for ever. At some time a decision has to be made. But that is a matter on which the MLC should take note of the hon. Member's view to ensure that there is a fair balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister of State rather over-stating his case? I thought I heard him say a few minutes ago that the trade would be in a stronger position if the Bill went through without the amendment. Yet, as I understand, that is not the opinion of the trade. Various organisations in the trade have given considerable attention to this new proposal. Generally speaking, they are in favour of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons are fairly plain. I appreciate that there will be—to use the phrase of the Minister of State—a two-way flow of ideas, but who initiates the two-way flow? As the Bill reads—unless I have woefully misunderstood it—initia-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
tion can come only from the Commission itself. In other words, it is up to the Commission to decide whether the interests of the trade are affected on a matter of importance and then for it to say to the trade "We believe this is an important matter for you. Come along and talk with us about this problem and we will listen to you". The two-way flow of ideas will then begin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade is saying that, if its interests are affected, surely the very people most likely to know best about that are in the trade itself. I am not saying that the trade alone will know best, but it is the most likely to know whether its interests are endangered or affected in such a way that consultation should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that the amendment means, if I have read it properly, is that, if the trade itself feels that its interests should be taken into account, there should be consultation; it should be able to say to the Commission "Here is a matter which concerns us very considerably. We want you to pay attention to our views. We should like to come to talk to you about it."Then the two-way flow of ideas begins, on its initiative, as well as on the initiative of the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a genuine two-way flow of ideas—I again use the phrase of the Minister of State—it must be a flow which may be initiated by either side. As the Bill now reads, only the Commission can know best about the interests of the trade. That is an appalling outlook. It is compounded by the inference that the trade will waste the time of the Commission and will be so irresponsible that it will be hammering on the door of the Commission every other day saying "We want to be consulted about this and that."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is a good reason why the trade will not do that. Who pays for the Commission? The trade itself. The money comes out of the meat trade or that part of the meat trade which is indigenous to this country. The more the trade wastes the time of the Commission and inflates its expenditure, the greater will be the levies imposed on the meat trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With all respect to those who drafted the Bill, and to those of the Commission who are probably responsible for
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
it I do not think that the meat trade is going to be irresponsible about this. It will not go to the Commission and ask to be consulted about a matter unless its interests are seriously affected and it is acting in good faith. The amendment merely underlines the right to approve a two-way flow of ideas, again to use that phrase of the Minister of State. If he is in earnest in using it I am sure he will agree that the meat trade should have the right to initiate discussions and consultations just as much as the Commission itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise well enough that at our last sitting the Minister of State said that the Commission consists of representatives of the meat trade and, therefore, they all know a great deal of the interests of the trade itself and will know when the trade's interests are affected. Up to a point that is true, but I hope that members of the Committee know enough of the real world to realise that, once people get on these boards, they become slightly removed from the day-to-day problems and not quite so sensitive as the elected representatives and the officials of the organisations whose job it is to understand the day-to-day problems of the trade. Therefore, I do not think it is quite fair to put the onus entirely upon the members of the Commission once they have removed themselves from the hurly-burly of the trade and become rather more respectable and go about wearing bowler hats instead of something else—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Butchers should always wear bowler hats in markets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Commission always wear bowler hats—leading a life rather removed from those who are concerned with the day-to-day business of the meat trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State is not a stubborn man. That would be the last word we would apply to him. But he seemed a little stubborn in not giving way at all on the amendment, and I hope that he will reconsider this. It is almost a slight on the trade to think that it cannot be allowed to initiate these consultations. If he says "No" to the amendment and gives no hope of considering it at a later stage, it will, I say with some regret, meet with a little resentment from those who are responsible for leading the meat trade now. For that reason,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat torn in this matter. I am persuaded by the arguments just advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), and indeed there can be considerable use for initiative from the trade or the designated parties themselves. On the other hand, the initiative clearly has to be placed somewhere. Responsibility and authority must both lie in the same area, and that is with the Commission. This, substantially, is what the Minister's answer has been to the Committee. It all turns on the sensitivity of the Commission, its responsiveness. There is nothing here to preclude representations, either orally or in writing. That does not necessarily mean consultations, which would come about as and when those representations are taken on board. One would think that, given that they are soundly reasoned and objectively submitted, there would be a proper response from the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, as I understand it, is the theme which the Minister is preaching to us—not pontificating—this morning. I have not got the 1967 Act in front of me. I merely asked the question: how is the consultation procedure, which I enlarge to include a memorandum of representations, monitored and reported upon, so that third parties, such as Members of this House, or members of the trade who wish to exert themselves from time to time, can genuinely assess the sensitivity and responsiveness of the Commission in these matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were we to have a reasonable reply to the query I have just put to the Minister, I could be persuaded to go along with the Bill as it stands. It turns very much on the sensitivities, as I said earlier, of the Commission in the whole of this matter, bearing in mind that authority and responsibility must lie in one place and that, clearly, is the Commission. It would be wrong to have it turn into an absolute free-for-all for the whole of the trade to be able to spark off the Commission just as and when it took it into its mind to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to be brief, and I do not wish to add to the remarks made by my hon. Friends the Members for Holland with
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
Boston (Mr. Body) and Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). I feel that the attitude so far adopted by the Minister is untypical of him as a person, although typical of the present Government, who seek to force through ill-thought-out legislation without amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's purpose in tabling these amendments is to improve the legislation, and in this we feel that we have the full support of the trade. How right my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge is in saying that to some extent the success of the legislation as it stands entirely depends upon the sensitivity of the MLC: But being able to submit evidence—a paper or a brief on a matter—to the MLC does not imply genuine consultation. It is our purpose to ensure that the representations made result in genuine and meaningful consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fact that the trade, even under the existing situation—it has representation on the Production and Distribution Committees and the Consumers Committee as well at present—does not- feel that the consultations that have taken place, the discussion and the exchange of views, have been as positive and as meaningful as it would have wished. I have a letter, dated 6th January 1976 from Philip R. Butcher, the Director of the Livestock Division, signing on behalf of the Director General of the National Farmers' Union, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have seen the list of amendments tabled on Clause 3 of the Agricultural (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and would just like to say that we support the intention of Amendments Nos. 14"—</p></blockquote>
He goes on also to list other amendments which the NFU supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that is, to require the MLC to consult industry organisations more comprehensively and to take account of their views in formulating programmes, especially financial ones".</p></blockquote>
I intend to refer later to the latter remarks contained in the letter under another group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also advise the Minister that I have here a letter from the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers. I quote what Mr. Llewellyn, who signed for the Federation, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I understand that the above Bill will be discussed by House of Commons Committee"—</p></blockquote>
he says "on Tuesday 13th January". In
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
fact, we did not reach this stage until somewhat later. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the attention of this letter is to inform you and your colleagues on the Committee that this Federation, which represents all meat wholesalers in England and Wales, supports Amendments Nos. 14"—</p></blockquote>
and he, again, goes on to give support for other amendments—
	<br><blockquote><p>"which are concerned with Clause 3 of the Bill regarding the future activities of the Meat and Livestock Commission".</p></blockquote>
This clearly indicates that the trade is not happy with the present situation and does not feel that the Bill we are considering gives it the opportunity of meaningful consultation, which I am sure the Minister wants to see but which the trade does not feel will be achieved in the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here a letter from the Meat Manufacturers Association from which I quote a small part:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We suggest, therefore, that the Bill should require the Commission to consult trade organisations if there are matters judged to be of substantial importance to the trade'.</p></blockquote>
The association does not feel that the onus being entirely on the MLC will give the association the opportunity of the consultation that it may think is necessary if for some reason the MLC is insensitive to a particular stand taken by a sector of the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our remarks have been constructive. We seek to improve the Bill and in no way to inhibit the functions or the activities of the MLC. I share the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston that seemingly at this stage the Government's reaction to this amendment is a slight upon the trade. The Minister implied in some of his remarks that it could well be that certain sections of the trade would seek to frustrate the functions of the MLC. I entirely endorse the views of my hon. Friend. This certainly would not be the case, because it is the trade which provides the major part of the finance for the Commission and it will not seek to frustrate the Commission or to increase the cost of the Commission, because that would be to its own detriment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition feel strongly about the amendment. As happened at the end of last week during a debate on the Floor
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
of the House regarding the butter fat content of milk, the Minister's opening remarks were somewhat insensitive and unhelpful, but in the few minutes that remained for him to reply at the end of the debate he showed an increased sensitivity and gave various assurances to the House which were accepted and taken in good faith. I believe that he should now similarly move his position or, alternatively, show more sensitivity to the purpose of the amendment. Otherwise, the Opposition will have to consider their position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very thorough debate. I first deal with the last point raised by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), who referred to some slight which I put on the industry in saying that there would be members who might hamper progress. I repeat my words to show that this is far from being the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the amendment could enable any organisation wishing to hamper the development of any MLC function to paralyse MLC progress in any given sphere, possibly to the detriment of the wider interests of others in the industry. I certainly think far more of the trade than to suggest that there would be any purposeful action which would be detrimental, although people who felt strongly that their interests might be affected could be sensitive about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) spoke I felt that he had just come in, because just before he spoke I had said that, if representations were made by an organisation to the MLC, the MLC would need to have good reasons for refusing to consult that organisation. I went on to say that the MLC is primarily responsible for deciding when the relevant interests are affected, but that does not mean that the MLC is permitted to refuse consultation. The hon. Gentleman nevertheless suggested that there were no means by which people on the designated list, or others, could make their views known to the MLC. I stress that the MLC must consult in a reasonable way, and the trade will have the right at any time to make representations. I cannot envisage a situation where the Commission or the trade behave in an unreasonable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question has been put as to how the consultation procedure is monitored
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
so that a third party can judge the Commission's sensitivity. I remind the Committee that the Ministry is continually aware of the feeling of the trade and of the issues being discussed which are of concern to people. Members of Parliament can always ask questions about the Commission's activities, and I do not believe that these activities can take place in secret. I am sure that anyone who felt that his interests had not been considered would say so loudly. Indeed, representations have been made to hon. Members opposite by a few organisations only amongst many others which are agreeable to the changes. Also, the MLC report and accounts are laid annually before both Houses of Parliament, having been presented to the Minister. Therefore, the MLC is an independent body, but at the same time it is responsible to Parliament and to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee whether the MLC is, or could be, subject to investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>a sigh of relief and relax. But at the same time I hope that he will listen to the brief argument I shall put to the Committee.</p>
	<p>The Commission, as at present constituted, does not involve a function which enables it to deal with matters relating to Northern Ireland. But bearing in mind the situation which exists in Ulster, the fact that it does not have a directly elected Parliament as it has had for 50 years, and that there is a great deal of trade between Northern Ireland and other parts of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
United Kingdom, I feel that the amendment would enable the Commission to keep closely in touch with interests in Ulster.</p>
	<p>The amendment reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"ascertain whether matters arising out of the exercise of the Commission's functions have or are likely to have a substantial effect on the interests of…persons"—</p></blockquote>
or organisations which operate in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>I appreciate that a number of organisations, such as the National Farmers' Union and the organisation representing the wholesale meat trade, do not think that this is a totally necessary amendment, although for the reasons that I have just advanced I believe that it is important not to disregard Northern Ireland. Where agriculture is concerned this is an important part of Great Britain. I hope for that reason that, if the Minister feels that no other amendment is necessary and no drafting amendments can be made later in the progress of the Bill, that the interests of Northern Ireland, which very often are reflected in organisations over here because organisations here have branches or sectors in Northern Ireland, will not be overlooked and that the functions of the MLC in the remainder of the United Kingdom will in no way act to the disadvantage of persons who operate in Ulster.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can respond very briefly to the comments of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr Winterton). As he says, the effect of the amendment would be to require the Commission to ascertain whether, in the exercise of its functions, there would be any effect on the classes of persons listed in the Bill who operate in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member, although I am sure he does not need reminding, because he seems to have done his work well, even though he may sometimes come to the wrong conclusions, that the VerdonSmith Committee made a thorough investigation of the position of the fatstock industry in Northern Ireland and concluded that it was, in a number of important respects, different from the rest of the United Kingdom. For that reason, it was not recommended that the Commission should extend its activities to Northern Ireland. When the Commission was established its activities were restricted to Great Britain. No alteration is proposed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
the territorial coverage by this Bill. It would, therefore, not be appropriate to require the Commission to establish the interests in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation in Northern Ireland is that the Livestock Marketing Commission has been established as an advisory body which performs many of the same functions as does the Commission for Great Britain. Those functions which the Meat and Livestock Commission performs in Great Britain as agents of the Government are conducted in Northern Ireland by the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. I understand that there is very close liaison between the Northern Ireland Livestock Marketing Commission which is, as I have said, an advisory body, and the Meat and Livestock Commission of Great Britain and I think there should be no fear that either of these Commissions' activities would infringe the interests of each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the information I have been able to give the hon. Member will satisfy him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister can give us some further information about whether reports are published—presumably they are—by the body which carries out the functions of the MLC in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be contentious, but there is no doubt that the meat trade is considerably affected—whether badly or otherwise I do not know—by the considerable smuggling activities of cattle from the south into the north and pigs from the north into the south. I understand that both occupations are highly profitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I know the difficulties of this matter, I wonder whether the Ministry receives reports about whether this smuggling affects the meat trade considerably one way or the other. There is no doubt that this is happening. I have had clear evidence of it. If the Minister will tell us anything about any report which we can study, it might help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to stray, like some of the cattle, over the border of our debate this morning. This is a matter mainly for the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. I am quite sure that the Northern Ireland Livestock Marketing Commission is very well aware of the problem and our own Ministry here is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
liaising on this. This assurance should be adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the problem to which the hon. Member has referred. It is not easily overcome, but there is close liaison among all the authorities concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my opening remarks, which I am sure you will agree were brief, Mr. Costain, I did not refer, on purpose, to the problems in Ulster, particularly those referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), namely, the pig smuggling from the north to the south and cattle smuggling from the south to the north. Both types of smuggling have created considerable problems for the agriculture industry in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the assurance that the Minister has given, it is not our intention to press the amendment to a Division, but I should like the Minister to repeat and to emphasise that in the Government's view the consultation and discussion, contact and co-operation among the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, the Livestock Marketing Commission and the MLC, is fully adequate and that the matters that affect Ulster and Great Britain are in no case overlooked. Discussions would involve transportation, animal health, progeny testing and so on. These are important matters on which problems could arise if there were to be any breakdown in the contact between Ulster and the rest of Great Britain. Is the Minister absolutely assured that the co-operation between Ulster, through the Livestock Marketing Commission there, and the MLC in this country is absolutely fully adequate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am so satisfied. Indeed, the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Fatstock and Carcase Meat Marketing and Distribution, referring to the decision not to extend the MLC's responsibility to Northern Ireland, recorded that it was expected that the Commission, in discharging any of its functions in Great Britain which might impinge on the interests of producers and the trade in Northern Ireland, would bear those interests in mind. If there is anything lacking in my assurance today, the fact that the hon. Member has raised this point will make those concerned even more sensitive about the matters which he has brought to our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for being on my feet so often this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous debate I made brief mention of a quotation from a letter which my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) had received from the National Farmers' Union. I hope that I have your permission, Mr. Costain, to repeat part of that quotation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…that is to require the MLC to consult industry organisations more comprehensively"—</p></blockquote>
and here is the crunch—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to take account of their views in formulating programmes, especially financial ones."</p></blockquote>
That clearly indicates that the National Farmers' Union and the meat trade are not happy at the way consultation has taken place in the past, particularly in relation to the budget, levy and future programmes are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard previous mention of the debate which took place nearly a year ago in relation to the increase in the MLC levy. The basic argument for the MLC levy increase was inevitably, justifiably and rightly, based on inflation. Opposition members of the Committee are not denying that inflation is a relevant factor in the requirements for more money which were submitted by the MLC. However, it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
odd to note—I hope that the Minister will comment on the matter in his reply—that 50 per cent. of the Commission's staff is certification personnel, whose cost increase in the budget is relatively negligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are of the opinion that the reasons for the Commission's deficit and requirement for a levy increase are related to capital expenditure, over-budgeting and its existing accountancy methods. On services, as I said earlier in the debate on the clause, in relation to another group of amendments, we are critical of the increase of 31 per cent. after netting of income in the general livestock improvement services. This calls for a complete reappraisal and study of these services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are particularly critical of the "on farm" testing and recording, which is up by £90,000—by any standards, a hefty increase. It is in fact an increase of 40.7 per cent. net. We believe that most of the Commission's services should be cost effective and self-financing by means of these services which are being charged for. Where carcase classification is employed primarily to authenticate the weight, this charge should be on levy income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are of the opinion—again, I am repeating a comment that I made in an earlier debate—that some of the university grants are not only too high—the total cost is, I believe, …196,000—but that some grants are leading to overlapping of research. This is a waste of the industry's money and requires a fairly detailed study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now move on to the accounts. Last year's levy increase led to a 100 per cent. increase in the Commission's capital expenditure, from 167,000 up to £337,000. If the Commission is indulging in substantially increased capital spending, the trade should have some positive say in it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the farmers, too. My hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) is absolutely right. Such consultation should take place early, before projects are actually decided. If I interpret the trade correctly, its complaint is that it does indeed have notification of what will happen, but it has it when the Commission has decided exactly what it is going to do, and the trade is merely asked to comment. That is not what I would describe as meaningful consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consider it essential that there should
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
be an annual declaration of the current value of all capital assets of the MLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are opposed to the paper loss of equities investment being put against the general account and used as one of the arguments for levy increase. These are all valid points, to which I hope that the Minister will direct his attention in replying to this group of amendments, which we consider to be perhaps the most important amendments tabled to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the greater proportion of the investment in the MLC should be in gilt-edged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are opposed to the practice of netting the income for services charged when the budget is formulated. That income should be shown separately, and this is the view of the meat and livestock trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also call for a standstill on levy rates, for many reasons, some of which I have already stated, and also in view of the current economic situation which affects the meat trade and the farmers as much as, if not more than, many other sections of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important amendments. There is no point in the MLC indulging in mock consultation with the meat and livestock trade. I suppose we could say, with complete justification, that this group of amendments could well have been taken with Amendment No. 14 which dealt with meaningful consultation. It is pointless the MLC's stating that consultation with the trade merely involves notifying all the interests within the meat and livestock industry of a future programme, and asking the trade to comment upon it, when the programme is already decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone who shall remain unnamed this morning once stated in a debate that the man in Whitehall knew best. The country's present plight clearly indicates that the men in Whitehall do not know best. I say that with no disrespect to them as individuals. I believe that the trade knows its business, and that it is the duty of the MLC to indulge in meaningful consultation with the trade at an early stage of its annual budget and future development programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the phrase "The gentleman in Whitehall knows best" was uttered by a Socialist

Minister in the context of the nutrition of the British people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot comment on the quotation to which my hon. Friend refers, but I believe that it was the present Lord President of the Council who stated in a debate that the man in Whitehall knew best. However, if I am incorrect, I am happy to withdraw that remark. The meat and livestock trade knows its business, and knows how its business can de developed to the advantage of the consumer and the farming industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plea I make in the amendments is that consultation in the future must start at a much earlier stage. The industry wants to be consulted at an early stage about future development and projects proposed by the Commission. It does not want to be faced with a piece of paper setting out the proposals for the next year, or whatever it may be. It wants to be consulted about the MLC's projects and what capital expenditure by the Commission is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come hack to the point that it is the trade itself that pays much of the money which finances the MLC. Therefore, it is important that the trade is consulted in plenty of time about the budget. It is interesting to note that many county councils are having meetings with borough councils within their boundaries long before the budget and rate precept are decided upon. They are engaging in meaningful consultation with representatives of the ratepayers, because it is the ratepayers who are meeting so much of the cost of local government, whether through rates or taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will meet the intention behind the amendments, and that he will ensure that in future the MLC is instructed to engage in consultation and contact with the trade far earlier in the year and long before budget proposals and future development programmes are decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister of State will not repeat what he said on the earlier amendment, that the Commission will consult if it has good reason to do so, and leave it at that. I shall be sorry if he does. None of us doubts that the Commission will act in good faith. The Minister criticised me a few moments ago for lambasting the MLC and saying nothing good in its favour. I thought that I had tried to say some good things in its favour,
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
and I particularly paid a warm tribute to those who have presided over it. But perhaps the Minister was not tuned in when I did that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister says that the Commission will consult if it has good reason to do so, he is really saying that it will consult if it thinks it a good idea to do so. That is putting a great burden on the Commission to decide what is really in the interests of the meat trade and the farming community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, the Commission has the power to embark upon a great deal of expenditure of other people's money without adequate consultation with those most affected. We may hope that it will act differently, but the track record is not too good on that score. I do not want to dwell on that matter, but I hope that there will be an improvement in the future. However, when the Minister says that the Commission will consult if it has good reason to do so, he is making an assumption which he is not entitled to make. He is assuming matters that are outside the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lawyers speak of the golden rule, which is that when one is considering statute law one must look at the Act itself. One must attribute to the words used in it their ordinary meaning and not go beyond what the Act says. When the Minister makes his assumption he is in breach of that famous golden rule. He is making an assumption which he should not make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall have proper consultations in which the meat trade and the farmers may take the initiative, particularly on matters of capital expenditure. This is important for the future of the Commission. I believe that the Minister said last week that there was unanimous support for the Commission. I am chairman of one body concerned with meat traders, and I know that there is unanimous opposition to the Commission's work in so far as it affects us. We are very doubtful whether the Commission, given the powers it has now, can do what we should like it to do for our area of farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of research was done on all forms of meat production—especially in the pig industry—before the Commission and that dreadful institution, PIDA, were set up. PIDA was even worse than the Meat and Livestock Commission. Nobody in the pig industry dares talk about it. It has been buried and nobody can now say a good word for what it did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Up in Scotland perhaps it was different. But in England it was a dreadful institution. It spent a great deal of money and failed to co-ordinate. The Commission is in danger of doing the same thing. It is failing to co-ordinate the research being undertaken in universities and by meat manufacturers, feeding stuff manufacturers and so on. It is nonsense to speak of the meat trade and industry as having lacked any kind of research. There has been a great deal of research. I believe that most people concerned with farming would say that on the whole the most valuable research has been that done by the bodies I mentioned, and not that done in recent years by PIDA or the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should think again about his attack on PIDA. In my previous employment I was closely involved in the work done by PIDA, and I know that the hon. Gentleman's views are not shared. as he claims, by the pig industry.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enter into controversy, but many farmers remember how almost every item of research undertaken by any body was published and claimed by PIDA itself. That was particularly the case when the PIDA levy was once increased. When I was Member for Billericay—an area where there were many pig producers—the stormiest meeting I ever had was a protest meeting about PIDA. I have attended meetings in South Wales, and many other awkward places, but none has been more difficult than the meeting at which the pig producers of Essex complained about PIDA.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking into the future, I see a case
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
for a great deal of capital expenditure on meat industry research. I hope the Minister will not think that I am taking a different viewpoint. But I ask him to bear in mind that this research has been continuing and developing over many years, and that there is an urgent need now for a proper co-ordination of the research being done by so many institutions other than the Commission, apart from work being done under its auspices or within its knowledge. It will be a great waste of public money--as well as a great waste of money coming out of the pockets of the meat traders and farmers by way of levies—if there is not a sensible co-ordination of the research. The meat trade takes the view—and I believe this to be the view of the farmers—that there cannot be this co-ordination, this prevention of over-lapping, unless there is the kind of consultation for which we ask in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making this plea to save public money and money from the pockets of the meat trade, I hope that the Minister of State will favourably consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the debate, and I do not want to go into the question of PIDA, on one side or the other of the border. But I wish to emphasise that the amendment is highly important, because it explicity underlines the reasons why we have tabled all the amendments on consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably the major matter over which feelings run high is the question of the sudden presentation of a budget which shows that the charges and levies must be increased. Unless there is proper consultation, the various bodies which have to pay the levy, and others concerned with it, will not be able to make representations as to whether a new side of the Commission should be started resulting in increased expenditure in one direction or another. They will want the chance to evaluate the results of the previous year's expenditure. They will want to know where the MLC is going and why the proposed budget for the next year is in the form that it is and involving the amount of expenditure that it does.

cerned need reassurances that the consultation will start really early, when the budget appears to be in early gestation. The length of a cow's gestation would be about the right period.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to prolong the argument which my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) began, but I recommend him to read the OFFICIAL REPORT of the consideration in Committee of the Agriculture Act 1967. My hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I start coughing it will be because the words are choking in my throat, but I have to agree with the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary a few moments ago. It seems to me that PIDA and the Beef Recording Society between them at last brought the livestock industry kicking from the old-fashioned ludicrous method of animal and livestock evaluation, from the old days of confirmation and pedigree, which mean so little in practical terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key paragraph in the letter sent by the chairman of the MLC, Mr. George Howard, to industry organisations on 5th December I975 was paragraph 9, headed " Finance ", which is important in our deliberations. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission appreciate that industry organisations wish to be kept informed of the Commission's finances. With this in mind the Commission have convened a meeting on 11th December to discuss the provisional accounts for the year ended 30th September 1975 and the estimates of income and expenditure for the year ending 30th September 1976. If this experiment is successful, it is proposed that in future this will take place each year in the autumn".</p></blockquote>
That goes some of the way to meet what the amendment is about. It would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister would tell us the outcome of that meeting on 11th December and the extent to which the Commission was able to go into detail about budgetary matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no wish to repeat the remarks I
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
made in our similar discussion on Amendment No. 14. It is essential that everything possible be done to enable the Commission to take all industry organisations with it and have their cooperation and support. I do not take the view taken by some organisations that the Commission has been playing the hand with the cards very close to its chest. It should bend over backwards to consult about the budget and its plans for future operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will understand that, of all our amendments on these matters, this is the one which the trade organisations believe to be the most important. I believe that if the meat trade organisations—I cannot speak for the National Farmers' Union—were able to pick from this group one amendment to be accepted by the Government, this would be the one. We are not asking too much. If the amendment is accepted, a great deal of good will be done for relations between the bodies with which the Commission has to work. I hope that the Minister will give a helpful answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and important debate which has ranged fairly widely. Comments on the pig industry were trotted out by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). I refer the Committee to the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Minister on 12th November, which sets the background to the matter we are now considering. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My Department and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland have now completed the review of the Meat and Livestock Commission's activities which was announced during the debates on the MLC Levy Order last April. In the course of this review we sought the views of organisations representing the producers, meat traders and consumers and discussed them with the commission as well as the latter's own proposals."</p></blockquote>
He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the review we received from the industry organisations consulted a number of helpful comments and suggestions intended to improve the balance and cost effectiveness of the Commission's activities. All these suggestions have been fully considered in consultation with the Commission. In many cases the suggestions are accepted by the Commission, but some involve technical judgments on which the Commission has reservations and others do not in the Commission's view take full account of the nature and aims of the activities in question. In such cases the Commission has expressed its reach-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
ness to discuss the suggestions further with the appropriate organisations through its consultative machinery. I hope the organisations concerned will respond accordingly, making full use of the improved consultation arrangements to which I have referred, as they are developed."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 12th November 1975; Vol. 899, c. 827–28.]</p></blockquote>
This provides the background to the extensive amount of consultation which has taken place between all the interests concerned in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments seek to ensure the establishment of a statutory framework of designated organisations whose views must be taken into account, and, in particular, to require the Commission to consult them in the draft budgetary proposals in the autmn of each year, when the Commission would be required to take account of their observations on future long-term expenditure and related levies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the thoughts and aims behind the amendments, but there may be inherent dangers in attempting to write them into legislation. I cannot see that we can introduce a statutory requirement for the Commission to establish, by negotiation, a framework of designated organisations without also defining in the Bill exactly what that framework is to be, and how it would operate. In that case we should find ourselves re-establishing a statutory committee framework closely resembling that which, having proved unsatisfactory in the production and distribution sector, we are seeking to abolish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that with so many industry organisations affected by the wide-ranging functions laid on the MLC, some co-ordinated pattern of consultation is desirable. The Commission is also alive to this, and intends to set up panels of organisation representatives, so that whilst it may be appropriate to consult an individual organisation on occasions, it is expected that consultation will normally be conducted through groups of organisations with a common interest. Indeed, the Commission has already put its ideas on this to the industry organisations. With past experience of attempting to solve this problem statutorily, I hope that hon. Members will agree that the best chance of success lies in enabling the most suitable framework to be devised pragmatically, as the clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
On the question of consulting designated organisations on the MLC's draft accounts and annual budget, there are also some pitfalls to be avoided. Section I9 of the I967 Act requires the Commission to make a report to Ministers on the discharge of its functions under the Act, and for a copy of that report to be laid before the House. It also requires the Commission to transmit to Ministers audited statements of account and a report on them, copies of which are also laid before Parliament. We must be careful, therefore, not to cut across this answerability to Parliament by imposing a statutory duty on the Commission to consult industry organisations on its financial arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, as my right hon. Friend said on I2th November, in the parliamentary answer which I quoted a few moments ago, we believe it is right that industry organisations should be kept informed about the overall make-up of the Commission's budget and should have an opportunity to express their views about its balance and the direction of new expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's suggestion of making an annual presentation of its budget to designated organisations has been accepted, and I understand that the first of these presentations was held on the day of the first meeting of this Committee, on IIth December. The Commission intends to make the presentations in the autumn in future, near to the beginning of its financial year, which runs from October to September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major projects and development normally originate in discussions with the advisory committees. Various hon. Members questioned whether there was enough time for proper consultation before the projects got into the pipeline. It is important to bear in mind that many of the projects and developments originate with the advisory committees which the MLC has set up, quite apart from the statutory arrangements. All these non-statutory consultations will, of course, continue. There will also be the annual budget discussions where ongoing expenditure can be examined and any new projects discussed. But, as I said, new prospects do not just happen but evolve from advice given to the Commission and are discussed by all the interests concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, therefore, that the steps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
taken fulfil the objectives of the amendments. Particularly in view of the attendant difficulties that I have mentioned, I strongly urge hon. Members to conclude that the amendments are neither appropriate nor necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the technical questions raised by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and others are matters for the Commission. They were right to draw them to our attention, but I hope that their misgivings about proper consultation in the future are overcome by the assurances I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on this side of the Committee are grateful for the Minister's relatively sympathetic reply. None of us underestimates the good faith of Mr. George Howard, who is Chairman of the Commission. We have no doubt that his views were clearly expressed in the letter which my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) mentioned, referring to a meeting on 1Ith December about consultation and the setting up of various panels to ensure that discussion and negotiation between the MLC and the trade were more meaningful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we cannot judge what a future Chairman of the MLC will do, or what his views will be. For this reason we have put forward these amendments, which are fully supported by the National Farmers' Union, the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers, the Meat Manufacturers' Association, and the Smithfield Market Fresh Meat Traders' Association. Those organisations represent a majority of the meat and livestock trade. Therefore, their views carry great weight, and there is no good reason why our amendments should not be included in the Bill. We believe that they represent the interests of the trade and will improve the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question put by one of my hon. Friends has remained unanswered by the Minister. Would a trade organisation or an individual with interests in the meat and livestock industry have the right to appeal to or refer a case to, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration if it were felt that those interests were not being properly considered by the MLC? To what other body could trade organisations or individuals appeal if they felt that their interests were not
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
being heeded and understood by the MLC?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister of State that there was no consultation between the trade and the MLC about the projects to which I referred at an earlier Sitting, the project at Blisworth, which is reputed to have cost £100,000, and the projects at Sutton Bonnington and lngliston. Here is a clear example of the Commission's proceeding with capital projects without any consultation with the trade. It is for this reason that we seek to write these safeguards into the Bill. We have the wholehearted support of the trade for the amendments. Does not the Minister agree that a study is required of methods of initiating projects. and that the trade must he involved in discussions about what projects are to be initiated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The piecemeal availability of the budget for the current year, parts of which became available only halfway through the year, must be put right, with proper consultation, and the issue of both sides of the budget three months before the beginning of the year. It is important that both sides—not pieces of the budget which the MLC feels it can reveal and discuss—should be available in plenty of time. Does not the Minister also concede that consultation on expenditure over £10,000 in sum and in aggregate should form the basis of consultation between the trade and the MLC?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be full consultation about the draft accounts. The Minister has given certain assurances that they should be discussed at an earlier stage, but the trade is looking to the Bill to safeguard its interests, and to ensure that the MLC now and in the future, under whatever chairman may be appointed, will attend to these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be a complete reappraisal of, and substantial improvement in, the consultation mechanism of the statutory committees. Consultation with the trade and industry should take place more often and on a regular pattern. I do not believe that this has happened in the past. I agree that Mr. George I-Toward has indicated that this may well be the intention of the MLC in the future, but it has not been the nattern in the past, and the trade rightly looks to this Committee and to the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
to ensure that these matters are properly attended to in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have presented the case fairly briefly, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland has said, this is perhaps the most important group of amendments to the Clause. The industry is united in its view that the amendments are necessary. The trade set up the Meat Promotions Executive Committee, which was agreed by the Meat and Livestock Commission. That clearly indicates that the trade has some good ideas. I believe that the proposals in our amendments would advance the interests of the trade and ensure proper and meaningful consultation on the most important aspect of the MLC's work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not helpful to have a debate in sections. I think that I replied to most of the comments of the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) at the opening of the debate. I have given him assurances, which he has good reason to accept, that a great deal of consultation has gone on since the statement by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary in April on the levy order and the Parliamentary Answer given by my right hon. Friend on 12th November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also given an assurance that the intention is to hold a presentation in the autumn, after 1st October. That is much earlier than last year's consultations, which took place on 1Ith December. In this way a meaningful figure can be placed on outgoing expenditure and the balance likely to be available for proposed new expenditure. As I have said, there is also consultation on projects at a much earlier stage with the advisory committees concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman questioned whether the present chairman would hold meaningful meetings on the budget. He asked what guarantee there was of meaningful consultations, and what would happen in the future if provisions were not written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I was not doubting the integrity or good faith of the present chairman, but I was casting
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
some doubt on what might happen under a future chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I was about to say that I do not think that a commitment by a chairman could be unilaterally abandoned by a future chairman. The chairman, after all, is responsible for maintaining the best possible relationship between the industry and the trade, and clearly a unilateral withdrawal would not help that. In any case, there is adequate representation of the many interests concerned on the Commission itself and on the existing advisory committees. I am sure that no chairman could make a change without those concerned making their views thoroughly known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the hon. Gentleman's question about an individual's right to go to the Ombudsman, he will know that the MLC is not a Government organisation within the province of the Parliamentary Commissioner. Hon Members are, I am sure, quite capable of drawing attention to any shortcomings of the MLC. Recent examination of its activities shows how open it is to scrutiny. In effect, this clause is the result of an enormous review of the workings of the MLC with full representations from and consultations with the trade. Although we agree with the spirit of the amendment, I hope that the Committee will agree that to write it into the clause would be unnecessary, in view of the strong assurances which have been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting into some difficulty now. The Government have said that they agree with the spirit of the amendment, yet they are not prepared to write it in. In my view, that is a mistake. In view of the widespread support for these amendments, I feel that we should press the Government. Unless the Minister is prepared to say that he will reconsider the matter between now and Report, we shall have to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. I7, in page 3, line 28, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Those classes of persons mentioned in Part IIA of Schedule 1 to this Act may appeal to the Minister should they feel that the Commission has failed to fulfil its obligations contained under section IA (1) above".</p></blockquote>
I shall speak to the amendment very briefly, because every member of the Committee will be aware that to some extent we have covered these matters already on earlier amendments. Bearing in mind that the Government have prevailed in the votes this morning, it is worth raising one or two matters again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his comments at the end of the last debate, the Minister indicated that members and organisations within the trade could not appeal to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, although no doubt they could make their views clearly known to Members of the House and that the Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture were clearly answerable to Members in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not good enough. The present Minister of State said what he has said in good faith. But I repeat that the present Government are pushing this and other legislation through the House and are refusing responsible and constructive amendments. As a result, the legislation will not achieve all that the Government wish, and certainly not all that the Opposition wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, the amendment is about an appeal to the Minister. We believe that there should he some safeguard for the meat and livestock trade, should it or an individual company, an individual trade, or an individual himself or herself, feel that the MLC is not taking into proper consideration matters which an individual trade feels should be taken into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither I nor my party is trying
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
to burden the Minister and his Department with irresponsible appeals and representations. In my view and in my experience, the trade is highly responsible. It wants the consumer, agriculture, and its own industry to benefit. Therefore, it will not act to the detriment of the consumer, the farmer, or even the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appreciate that the Minister has more than enough on his hands and that this Department has a very heavy load of work. But, surely, if the Government have defeated on a vote in this Committee the reasonable amendments that we felt were for the benefit of the trade, would improve consultation, and write in certain safeguards to the advantage of the trade, then in my view the Minister must give some ground on this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that there would be very few appeals. But if an organisation feels that for some reason its interests have been overlooked, that the MLC is not receptive to its case and, in the view of that organisation, has not properly considered a particular representation or group of representations, in the last resort I believe that that organisation should have the right of appeal to the Minister. The Minister could then make a decision either in favour of the trade organisation or individual or clearly indicate that he feels that the MLC has fully carried out its functions and that the representations made have been properly and fully considered by the MLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would be a safeguard. I repeat that we feel that it is necessary in order to give the assurance to the trade that, if the MLC is not doing its work, it has some immediate come-back and can appeal to the Minister, who could direct the MLC to give further and full consideration to a particular matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel strongly about this amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
ment, particularly in the light of the unfortunate way in which the Minister turned down the amendments we moved earlier this morning. The Minister has the respect of every member on this side of the Committee. I know that he has a difficult job. He may be acting within a framework of instruction from his party that has been used already this morning. I am sure that, if he were permitted, he would be a little more sympathetic to the views and amendments that we have put forward this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not trying to frustrate the Government. We want the Bill to go through quickly, but we want it to go through in a form that will be positively useful to the consumer, to the Ministry, and to the meat and livestock trade. I feel that the Government, for some inexplicable reason, are not prepared to open their eyes and are blinkered to the purpose of our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on this amendment the Minister will be sensitive to the fact that there must be some safeguard written into the Bill to ensure that the trade, in the last resort, has some person to whom it can appeal if it feels that its interests are being neglected or overlooked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has used the word " safeguard " and has rightly stressed it. If the amendment is approved, it will enable some safeguard to be inserted where at the moment there is none. By opposing the earlier amendments the Minister has done a very serious thing. We know that administrative bodies have considerable powers, but growing up is a body of administrative law to try to check the arbitrary use of those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we have prevented administrative law having any effect in this province. That is a serious matter that I do not think the Minister appreciates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I said earlier that the lawyers speak for the golden rule and that one must work within the Act and not search the pages of HANSARD to see what a Minister may have said and be guided by that. No lawyer can go to the Divisional Court of the High Court or any other tribunal to ask that tribunal to exercise its quite considerable powers to prevent an injustice from being done by relying upon words of good
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
faith that may have been uttered some years previously by a Minister of State who, by that time, would have been elevated to the peerage or the chairmanship of some attractive board. We have to look only at the Act and no writ of 	<i>certiorari</i> would be possible for anyone who felt aggrieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter and I hope that the Minister will consider it. This is all part of a process that has been developing in Whitehall rather too much in recent years, by persuading Parliament to pass legislation that will prevent aggrieved people and organisations, even though they may be democratically responsible, from going to the courts to seek the redress which they would otherwise have, but for words inserted into an Act of the kind that we have chosen to insert today. It is a serious matter that we are depriving organisations—we have spoken of the Meat Manufacturers' Association and others—of the right to go to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we are assuming that the Commission will act fairly. We assume that there will always be somebody of the calibre of Mr. Howard as chairman of the Commission and that it will continue to do its best. But these are assumptions that I do not believe we ought fairly to make. I believe that when these powers function certain organisations—just one or two perhaps—will from time to time exceed the powers that Parliament has given them. Parliament has given them absolute and arbitrary powers and has done so on this occasion. In years to come some organisation will be deprived of the redress that it would otherwise have. This is the importance of the amend- ment. It is a longstop and the final safeguard that we can insert in view of what we have failed to do up to now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has made another good contribution to our proceedings. If I can persuade the Committee, as I have so far today, to accept the point of view that I have put forward I do not think the hon. Member should regard that as personal. However, he tries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not briefed by my party or by any outside forces. My right hon. Friend, my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, and I myself, give careful
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
consideration to all matters that come before us in the light of the situation and in an effort to ensure that the wellbeing of all the interests concerned is safeguarded. This is an assurance that I am sure the Committee will accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, as the hon. Member for Macclesfield has said, that the purpose of the amendment is to provide the right of appeal to the Minister for those classes of persons to whom the statutory consultation procedure applies, if they feel that the Commission has failed to fulfil its obligations. The position should be looked at under the existing legislation, and the 1967 Act applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Gentleman that for a long time now, since the I967 Act, there has been no right of appeal to the Minister. The hon. Gentleman is seeking to alter something which up to now all the interests concerned have accepted as being a tenable position. The situation under the Bill is the same as that under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear in mind the independence of the MLC, which was established as an independent body and which differs from other authorities such as the Home Grown Cereals Authority, in that members of the Commission are required to be independent. Acceptance of the amendment would fundamentally alter the role of the MLC. At the moment it is answerable to Parliament, but it is independent in that Ministers cannot interfere in its day-to-day activities. This is no new situation, because it applies to a whole range of nationalised industries and it would be very difficult to suggest that there is a case for day-to-day interference with our nationalised industries and other public bodies which are appointed by Ministers. Ministers appoint the members of MLC under Section 1(3) of the 1967 Act. Under the Bill Ministers are to be given the job of designating relevant organisations for the purpose of consultations. This is what we have been discussing. They also have the power under Section 20 of the I967 Act to give such directions of a general character as may appear to them to be in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, and this has been the position for some years, Ministers have no power to interfere in individual cases. If there were to be a right of appeal—say livestock producers thought
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
that their views had not been given enough consideration by the MLC—there would also have to be power for the Minister to direct the MLC as to the exercise of its functions in each individual case. In other words, the amendment could not stand on its own. The only consequential amendment to make it work would be one which would deprive the MLC of the authority it has enjoyed in its consultative functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to see how the amendment can succeed without some fundamental alteration in the Meat and Livestock Commission's authority. The Commission has been given a great deal of independence and the 10 Commissionsers are appointed by Ministers
	<br><blockquote><p>"by reason of their financial, commercial, technical, scientific, administrative or other relevant experience, and have no such financial or commercial interest as would be likely to prejudice the proper discharge of their functions as members".</p></blockquote>
There are safeguard powers in Section 20 to give directions to the Commission of a general character in the public interest, but none to interfere in particular cases such as would arise from an appeal envisaged by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside the statutory situation, in the last analysis the true value of consultation arrangements must depend largely on the will of the parties concerned to make the arrangements work successfully. Hence our desire to leave them fairly flexible. The new arrangements we have proposed should strengthen and improve communications. The very essence of consultation implies that views are taken into account, even though all views clearly cannot succeed all the time. It would not be useful to write in any further provisions concerning the consultation arrangements, especially a provision that would seek to limit the Commission's responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves whether the Commission is to be an independent statutory body, set up with the will of Parliament, representative of the many interests in the industry concerned, and left to do the iob in a responsible way, as I am sure hon. Members believe it will do it, or whether we are to have a body which will be subject to the dictates of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
However, we should not overlook the accountability to Parliament. There are opportunities to raise matters on the Floor of the House at Question Time about the work of the Commission, to ask questions about the annual report and accounts, which are laid before Parliament, and in debates on the levy order and other aspects concerning the Commission from time to time. The greatest safeguard, however, is the calibre of those we appoint to the Commission, representative and responsible as they are, and their sensitivity to the wellbeing of the industry they serve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be true, and is true at present. My hon. Friends are saying that the Minister has turned down every form of widening consultation and writing it into the Bill. Is the Minister now saying that this body is responsible only to itself and that, if a Government of a certain viewpoint should desire to appoint anyone of certain views to this Commission, the affected bodies would have no comeback whatsoever? In other words, is the MLC entirely without responsibility to Parliament except that the levy can be questioned, or the accounts, or something of that nature? It is the day-to-day running that one must think about. I hope that that will never happen, but one has to look to the future, which is what my hon. Friends are worried about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister had given way on certain other matters beforehand, I believe my hon. Friends would have been far happier. This is a longstop safeguard because the Minister has not given way at all along the line to perfectly reasonable suggestions. But on this occasion it is as a longstop—I may have misunderstood the Minister—that this body is entirely responsible only to itself and that the Government can appoint all the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has the case, therefore, that a Government of a particular hue that might wish to appoint certain people with certain well-known ideas which would affect the interests of certain sectors of the livestock industry. Where would their comback be? How would any part of the industry be able to make any form of representation or have any rights if it felt that it was being ridden rough-shod over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had answered the questions fully. I should not like the Opposition to be dispirited because no amendments are being accepted. What really matters is, not that the administration accept a certain proportion of the amendments which are put down—I should not like this to be written statutorily into the Standing Orders of the House—but that the amendments proposed are responsible ones, which is the case with those that we have been debating, and that Ministers should try to satisfy the Committee or the House as to the merits of the case being put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked about the way in which aggrieved parties can get some remedy. There is, of course, access to the courts. The proposals do not prevent individuals or organisations from applying to the High Court for prerogative orders of, for example, 	<i>mandamus,</i> to compel the performance of the statutory duty or prohibition to prevent an act which is considered to be ultra vires. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) nods his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shakes his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a barrister-cum-pigman—if I may so describe him—the hon. Gentleman may have more information. Having said that this body has been set up by Parliament, that the members of the Commission are appointed by Ministers for their responsibility, experience and representative capacity in the industry, having pointed out the other aspects of access to Parliament, including the laying of the annual report and accounts before the House, and with the assurance I gave earlier that the Ministry is very much in touch with the Commission with its widespread activities in the interests of the trade, I believe that all these assurances should be acceptable. There is no right of appeal under the existing legislation—the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those assurances, I hope that the Committee will be satisfied about the protection of the rights of the individual, although it will be realised that, given the wide range of publicity-appointed bodies, there cannot be day-to-day monitoring of all the activities of the Coal Board, the Gas Board, the power and energy undertakings, transport. British Rail, and so on. This House,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
which already has an enormous amount of work, could not take care of all that. So we appoint bodies with terms of reference and leave them as independent bodies to act responsibly to the House and to the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the Minister of State has just said. No one is suggesting that the MLC will act irresponsibly, but it may act inadvertently with some degree of incompetence—not tomorrow, not next year, but in years to come. We must have safeguards against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment, which is connected with earlier amendments, relates to consultations. I tried to make the point earlier—perhaps inadequately—that, as the Bill stands, organisations concerned with the meat trade have no right to insist upon consultations with the Commission when they feel that their interests are affected. Of course, the Commission has the power to initiate those consultations, and all members of this Committee have complete faith that the Commission, as it is now established, will carry out those consultations. But the meat trade is unanimous in asking for these further safeguards for the good reason that they feel that their interests will not be safeguarded, as the Bill stands. Therefore, a real fear already exists which may materialise in years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the existing remedies that are available under administrative law—writs of prohibition,	<i>mandamus, certiorari,</i> and so on—is possible. They are absolutely impossible because of what we have done this morning. If we insist on saying that the Commission will consult if it thinks there is a good reason to consult—that is the essence of the matter—we are giving the Commission an arbitrary power. The meat trade, farmers, and so on. have no right to demand that consultation, no right to see the MLC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With every respect to the Minister of State and those who advise him, I say that it is quite impossible for anyone aggrieved on that head to go to the Divisional Court or any administrative tribunal and seek the kind of relief that I have spoken about, in view of the way the Bill is now framed. That is the importance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not alone. All the statutory boards set up before the war
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
retained these rights. It is only in recent years that successive Governments have come to the House and tried to take away from the individual these rights under administrative law. It is a serious matter that Parliament is again and again being induced by Governments to take away from the citizen his rights under administrative law. I feel strongly about it, because lawyers on whose judgment I rely share the view that it is dangerous for Parliament to go on taking away from citizens the rights that they had in the past and should have now to protect themselves when statutory bodies exceed their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As matters now stand under the Bill, we are imposing no requirement upon the Commission to have the consultations that the meat trade unanimously thinks it should have. This is the injustice that we are in danger of creating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am not out of order, Mr. Costain, repeating—I do this in view of what the Minister of State said about me earlier, namely that I could say nothing good about the Commission—that I have absolute faith that it will act properly at the moment; but it may have some degree of incompetence in the future. I am not doubting its good faith, but a lack of competence may emerge in years to come. As a result, there may not be the consultations that should take place. This is the point that I hope that the Minister of State will consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I would intervene briefly to sum up the debate from this side of the Committee. The Minister will note that Amendment No. 17 comes after Amendment No. 14 which we have debated in full, and after Amendments Nos. 16, 48 and 49, which we have debated in full. We are pressing this amendment only because we believe that the Government wrongly refused to accept, and voted down, our earlier amendments. If one or all of those amendments had been accepted, we would not have proceeded with this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, in our view, the final safeguard that we must put forward on behalf of the trade, because the Government have turned down what we considered useful and positive amendments. We must give the trade some safeguard. The Minister has rightly referred to the 1967 Act on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
a number of occasions, particularly to Section 20, which allows the Minister of Agriculture to give a general direction to the Commission on a particular matter but does not entitle him to interfere in a particular or specific case. Is that good enough?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the activities of the Commission and the interests of the trade can be fully debated in this House. He mentioned the report and annual accounts of the MLC. They are presented and laid on the Table. But that happens once a year. It could well be that a particular matter, the interest of a section of the trade, required urgent reconsideration by the MLC, and that it refused to budge on that matter. I agree that a Member of this House can raise it in an Adjournment debate, or even that the business of the House be interrupted under Standing Order No. 9 if Mr. Speaker is prepared to accept it. Inevitably the business of the House is overloaded, and Mr. Speaker is unlikely to grant a debate under Standing Order No. 9, although to the meat trade a particular matter, which it feels has not been properly considered by the Commission, is of urgent and immediate importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not given the assurance which the trade requests and which the Opposition feel should be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not doubt the ability, integrity, and good faith of the 10 commissioners that comprise the MLC. My hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has made that point very clear. We cannot speak about some, perhaps inexplicable, incompetence or oversight which the Commission may perpetrate at some time in the future. Therefore, we have tabled this amendment, which we feel is important, because the Minister and the Government failed to respond to the rational, responsible and constructive argument advanced in earlier debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
it is important that there is some safeguard for the trade. I remind the Minister that the Bill disbands the Production and Distribution Committees and removes from the Consumers Committee the trade representatives—three of them—which hitherto have sat on
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
that committee. Therefore, the statutory right which the traders had in the past is removed by the clause as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there are more safeguards written into the Bill. There are fewer safeguards. The purpose of our amendments this morning, and those debated at an earlier sitting, has been to ensure that adequate and meaningful discussion and consultation takes place and that these responsibilities and duties are written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be going round in circles. It is now alleged that, because we are disbanding the Production and Distribution Committees, the process of consultation has been weakened. Yet the whole debate has been on the basis that there has been discontent about the way those committees have been doing their jobs and this proposal strengthens the new arrangements. Indeed, the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and his hon. Friends have been saying that the Consumers Committee should go the same way, but now we are being told that this kind of disbandment means a weakening of the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed disbandment does not mean a weakening. It means a strengthening, because all the organisations designated will have direct access to the Commission itself. If the hon. Gentleman considers the composition of the Distribution Committee he will find that there are 26 organisations represented. Similar interests are listed in the Bill, so the distribution interests will not be voiceless in the new arrangements. The hon. Gentleman has been saying that this amendment will strengthen the newarrangements, butnow—perhaps the Opposition are hard up for arguments in favour of it—he is scraping the barrel to suggest that this is a weakening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify the point, because it is important. The situation is that this side of the Committee entirely agrees with the Government that the Production and Distribution Committees should be phased out because that system of consultation has not worked. However, the Minister will surely admit that it is up to the MLC to consult the trade rather than, as under the old system, those on that committee could exchange
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
views in a particular committee. The fact is that the organisations do not now have a mandatory right to make representations to the MLC. There is nothing written into this legislation to give them the assurance and the right that their. representations are being properly and fully considered by the MLC. It is the MLC which has the right, if it so thinks fit, to consult a particular organisation or interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be going back to the debate on a previous amendment. This has been disposed of. The hon. Gentleman made the, point that we are weakening the consultation. On the production side there are 11 organisations which have to be consulted at present, and similar interests have been written into the Bill. Hon. Gentlemen should read the annual report of the MLC and they will not only recognise the statutory committees which are now being abolished but also the various livestock and other committees—the Cattle Committee, Sheep Committee, Pigs Committee, Research Advisory Committee, EEC Committee, and possibly others. There is, therefore, adequate facility for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) raised, I believe, the question of total independence for the MLC. He is right, but only in its</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Committee has not found this morning's debates repetitive, although the voting figures have beer repetitive. I regret that the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) has not seen fit to participate in these important debates today. I know that there is a reason why he did not vote on a</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
	<p>conduct of those duties laid on it by the 1967 Act. It must operate within those confines and, of course, within the law. If it does not, and if it fails to meet its obligations, it may be challenged through the courts. Furthermore, as I said, under Section 20 of the 1967 Act Ministers can give a general direction to the MLC.</p>
	<p>I also wish to point out that as the MLC receives some Exchequer subsidy in relation to the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme, and in other ways, the spending of that money can be challenged by the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
	<p>To refer back to a question raised by the hon. Member for Macclesfield, calf smuggling is a matter which is at present being investigated by the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
	<p>As I said earlier, apart from the right of parliamentary representations, there is the right of representation through the courts for the individuals concerned.</p>
	<p>I believe that adequate assurances have been given on the rights of individuals and I certainly stress that we are not in any way weakening the rights of the individual in the Bill, because we are carrying on the procedure that has existed since the I967 Act.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>particular amendment, which is fully understandable, but I regret that he has not seen fit to participate in the debates.</p>
	<p>I will be brief. It will be helpful if this important category of person is included in the Schedule of Clause 3. The Minister will no doubt agree that vets are involved with livestock production. They are also involved with the sale of livestock, and no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) will wish to make some comment about livestock auctioneers. Vets are also involved where local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
authorities are operating slaughterhouses and where livestock and meat markets are concerned. They are also much involved with the distribution of livestock. For these reasons this category of person should be added to the schedule.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on this, because I believe that the veterinary service and veterinary surgeons are a highly important part of our livestock industry. The MLC is not only concerned with better classes of meat and producing what is wanted for the markets. It also supervises markets. In this work veterinary surgeons have much to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to bring up the case of the veterinary inspectors who will now, I understand, take over and be paid direct by the Ministry of Agriculture for inspecting meat at export meat manufacturers and meat slaughter houses which export meat to the Continent and elsewhere. Inspectors have a great deal of work at the ports where an important part of their duties is inspecting cattle to see whether they are fit to travel. We are all agreed that it would be a good thing if inspection were to be tightened up. We have all been concerned in cases where the export of live animals has not been as satisfactory as it should have been. I am glad that centres run by veterinary surgeons have been set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned mainly with companies which slaughter home-produced beef for export mainly to the Continent, particularly to Germany. Until recently those companies which slaughtered and
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
exported paid for the veterinary inspection themselves and arranged and agreed the veterinary inspectors' charges. I understand that in future the Ministry will debit exporters of meat with the cost of the livestock veterinary inspectors' charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter from the Buitelaar Group of Companies, probably the biggest and best known company in this line, which used to export a large number of live cattle but which has now turned largely, at the wish of the Ministry, to slaughtering and exporting carcases. The company has now been told that the Ministry, on representations from Brussels, has—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
