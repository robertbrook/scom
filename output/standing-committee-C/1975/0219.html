	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I have spoken to the Minister about this and should like to draw the Committee's attention to what was said by the Minister at our Twelfth sitting to the effect that the CAAV—the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers—had agreed to Clause 12 as well as Clause 11. I disputed that at the last sitting, but I had not then been able to speak to the chairman of the Executive who led the delegation of the CAAV to the Ministry. I have spoken to him by telephone this morning and he says that he has been misunderstood and is totally opposed to Clause 12 for reasons which he hopes to put in a letter to the Ministry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) for giving me that notice. I think it would be helpful if I explained the position as we see it in the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Central Association of Agricultural Values supports Clause 11 and there is no argument about that. It initially raised with the Ministry at official level a concern, or what could be described as an objection, to Clause 12 on the grounds that it would involve the Agricultural Land Tribunal in going over the work of the arbitrator. My impression is that the Association felt that this would play down the work of the arbitrator and it would be wrong for the ALT to go over the same ground and pronounce upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pointed out by our officials
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
that there was amisunderstanding, that there was no question of the ALT covering the same ground as the arbitrator but that the ALT would be adjudicating on quite different criteria. As a result of that it was the clear impression of our officials that the CAAV had no objection to Clause 12 and was quite happy about it. I am glad that the hon. Member has drawn attention to what would appear to be a misunderstanding, albeit a small one, between my officials and the CAAV. I shall be glad to receive a written statement hopefully explaining its interpretation of past events and, more important, stating categorically what its attitude is to Clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are discussing the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 51, in page 14, leave out lines 8 to 27.</p>
	<p>No. 53, in page 14, line 25, leave out from "effect" to "unless" in line 26.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to take long over the remaining amendments to Clause 12 because we have said that these matters will be debated again on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last words at our proceedings on Tuesday were that duplication of proceedings is unnecessary, especially since the Agricultural Land Tribunal can appoint assessors if required. The proposed amendment would leave out the arbitration provision, but it is thought that further amendment of Section 26 of the 1948 Act and regulations made under this section may be needed if notices to quit under this clause are to cease to be subject to arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of Amendment No. 52 would be to make a trap for the unwary tenant. Under the existing law a landlord may serve a notice to quit which may take effect in alternative ways. It may operate as a " simple " notice to quit referrable to the Agricultural Land Tribunal under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, Section 24(1). Alternatively, it may operate as a notice to quit giving one or more of the special reasons set out in Section 24(2) of that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
Act. In this case it is not at present referrable to the Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a notice thus capable of operating in the alternative is served by a landlord the tenant may concentrate his attention on the operation of the notice under Section 24(2). This may occur because the notice states a reason, such as failure to comply with a notice to do work, which naturally engages his attention. He may omit the precaution of also serving a counter-notice under Section 24(1) of the 1948 Act. If this happens, and the landlord does not succeed in obtaining possession by means of his notice operating under Section 24(2) of the Act, he may still contend that it is an effective notice for the purposes of Section 24(1). If this contention is successful, the tenant will then be too late to serve an appropriate counter-notice under Section 24(1) referring the notice to the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of the tenant falling into such a trap is, perhaps, greater than ever under the new provisions of Clause 12. This arises because the tenant is now enabled to serve a counter-notice referring to the Agricultural Land Tribunal certain notices under Section 24(2) of the 1948 Act. Having done so, he may easily fail to appreciate that a further counter-notice under Section 24(1) of the Act also referring the same notice to the Tribunal is still necessary in case the landlord subsequently puts forward the same notice as a notice under Section 24(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words in parenthesis in Clause 12(2) however, make the consent of the Tribunal necessary whether the notice to quit is put forward under Section 24(2) or under Section 24(1) in cases where the tenant is seeking to avail himself of the machinery of Clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be to delete this safeguard. I would not think that any fair and reasonable landlord would want to dispossess his tenant by catching him unawares on what is, after all, a legal technicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sounds complicated, but the basic point is that the existence of the one notice to quit based on the notice to do work could understandably deflect attention from the other notice to quit, which would be valid and would be the means of the tenant being taken unawares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
I should say a word about amendments Nos. 51 and 53. The hon. Member has kindly suggested that it is not important to go over these in detail. He has a fair point that much of the ground is common. I will, however, refer to one point. It may never be necessary for a notice to quit to be subject to a hearing before the Agricultural Land Tribunal. The result of the arbitration on the notice to quit may be favourable to the tenant anyway or, though favourable to the landlord, it may be in such a form that the landlord considers that he would be unlikely to pass the " fair and reasonable test of the Tribunal and will decide to let the matter drop. It would be absurd in such a situation for the parties to the dispute to be compelled to refer the matter to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. The Government consider, therefore, that as the tenant is the person most at risk when a notice to quit is served, the choice should lie with him as to whether the notice should first be referred to arbitration or whether it should immediately be referred to the Tribunal. In the latter event, however, he will he required to argue his case against the operation of the notice to quit only on the basis that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this will serve to reassure the hon. Member and that he will be able to withdraw his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that simple and clearly understood explanation will become compulsive reading in all tenants' farmhouses in the land. They will then realise why we feel that in the circumstances we would not wish to press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 111, in page 14, line 32, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a landlord serves, to expire on the same date, both a notice to quit containing such a statement as is mentioned in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (1) above and a notice to quit not containing such a statement (hereinafter called a " simple notice") and the tenant serves a counter-notice under section 24(1) of the 1948 Act in respect of the simple notice, then if an application is made by the landlord to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for consent under subsection (2) or (3) above, and also for consent under section 24(1) in respect of the simple notice,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
subsection (4) above shall apply in relation to the application to the Tribunal for consent to the operation of the simple notice in lieu of the provisions of section 25(1) of the 1948 Act".</p></blockquote>
This amendment began life as Amendment No. 80, and has since been renumbered, on my amending it slightly, to No. 111. This originates from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and is designed to avoid the confused situation which could arise where the landlord serves two notices to quit. Without this amendment the Agricultural Land Tribunal would have to apply two different tests when the notices were considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of Clause 12 will create an element of anomaly. At present a landlord may serve a notice to quit under Section 25 with no reasons given. For present purposes this may be called a simple notice. This procedure contrasts with that for a notice to quit served for one of the reasons set out in Section 24(2) of the 1948 Act. A tenant has the right to challenge a simple notice and a dispute is settled before the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 11 and 12 do not debar a landlord from serving both a notice to quit, following a failure to comply with a notice to remedy, and a simple notice to quit. Although this action on the part of the landlord might be regarded as an act of harassment, if this amendment is not accepted it will create a difficulty for the Agricultural Land Tribunal. Clause 12 introduces new criteria for determining whether the notice to quit shall take effect. The effect of this amendment is to ensure that where two notices to quit have to be considered by the Tribunal, the proposed criteria introduced by Clauses 11 and 12 shall prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union comment is that, although the amendment would appear to favour the tenant farmer, it wonders whether it is fair that the landlord should be deprived of his right to serve a simple notice to quit at any time, even contemporaneously with a notice to quit under Section 24(2)(d) and then have to seek to satisfy the Tribunal on any of the matters set out in Section 25(1) of the 1948 Act. I do not think that this is a particularly complicated point and we can easily understand it. The duplication of notices to quit is something that is familiar to
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
a number of people who are involved. I think the amendment satisfactorily deals with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has explained that the purpose of the amendment is to avoid a confused hearing in the Agricultural Land Tribunal. It is perfectly possible, and is often the case, that a landlord who serves a notice to quit under Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 which is founded on failure to comply with a notice to do work will, as an alternative, serve a simple notice to quit under Section 24(1) of the Act based on one or more of the grounds set out in Section 25(1) of the Act. His hope is that if his Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) notice fails he might still be successful with his 24(1) notice. When Clause 12 is enacted the tenant will have to serve a counter-notice to both notices to quit if he wishes to challenge them before the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The supposition behind the amendment is that if the Agricultural Land Tribunal attempts to deal with both notices to quit at the same time a muddle will ensue with the Tribunal applying one set of criteria to the 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) notice and different criteria to the 24(1) notice. But is it likely to try and deal with both at the same time? It is not for me to lay down how a Tribunal will conduct its hearings but I should be surprised if the chairman decided to do other than hear the case for one notice to quit in full first before turning to the alternative notice. I do not see how confusion would arise in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a more fundamental objection. The application of subsection (4) of Clause 12 is unsuitable in the case of a simple notice to quit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proviso to Section 25(1) of the 1948 Act, which would normally apply in an application to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for consent to such a notice, is phrased with a different emphasis to the wording of Clause 12(4). The latter clause provides that the Tribunal shall consent to the notice unless in all the circumstances it appears to it that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession. The onus is thus placed on the tenant, which is reasonable when he has—by the finding of an arbitrator or by tacit admission—failed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
carry out his repairing obligations. But it is not a suitable way to express the fair and reasonable landlord test, in relation to a simple notice to quit, when the provisions of Section 25(1) of the Act are expressed to be superseded and nothing but the test in Clause 12(4) is to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is rather complicated language but it follows inherently from the nature of the 1948 Agricultural Holdings Act. I should like to make one further point and to say that we are grateful to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare for moving this amendment since it has focused attention on what may be an inconsistency in the procedure laid down in Clause 12(4) in relation to a notice to quit capable of operating under different sections of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948. It is a complicated business. Although we do not accept the entire substance of the hon. Member's technical point I shall be happy to look again at the machinery of-Clause 12(4) to see whether it can be amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) started off by saying that this was a very simple point. It seemed to me, as he was making it, that it was a very simple point. But when the Minister read his reply I began to wonder whether he understood what he has in front of him. I should not if I were in his place—but I am never likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not understand a word of the reply and I was pleased when he said that it was a highly complicated and technical matter. This flows from the fact that we are interfering with the Agricultural Holdings Act without overhauling the totality of agricultural holdings legislation at the proper place and time. I have said this before. The Minister has almost proved to our satisfaction that he acknowledges this Bill to be the wrong place. Anomalies have arisen through what he is trying to do in Clauses 11 and 12. Although as the Minister said, he has not had enough time for legislation this Session I hope that this overhaul may be achieved by some future Government. The time we have spent in this Committee would have been far better spent overhauling the Agricultural Holdings Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). The speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) was straight forward and he knocked several nails fairly and squarely on the head. But when the Minister made his comments upon my hon. Friend's amendment I, too, was thoroughly confused. It seems a great pity that, in dealing with Clauses 11 and 12, we do not have expert legal advice as these are highly technical matters. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West quite rightly drew attention to the Minister's statement that, in the light of my hon. Friend's amendment, certain anomalies had come to his attention which he would do something about between now and Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This short debate on Clause 12, and the longer debate on Clause 11, has highlighted the need for a total review of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948. To tamper and tinker with that Act in this Bill will create a chaotic situation. T do not like what has happened. This clause will not improve the situation either for landlord or tenant. We want a complete review of the Agricultural Holdings Act. I regret that the Government have tinkered around with the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of my hon. Friend's comments, I hope the Minister will say a few more words about the situation. It is highly complicated although, in my view, the presentation of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare was superb in every way. He made the issue clear for me while the Minister confused it. Perhaps he can try and clear it up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their support and their kind words. It will be on clause stand part that I shall seek help on these matters. In view of the Minister's quite clear intention to look at this point again it would be churlish of me to press the amendment. I therefore beg to ask to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 81, in page 15, line 17, leave out from " means " to end of line 22, and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of the 1948 Act and this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
section a notice served on a tenant of an agricultural holding for the purpose of paragraph (	<i>d</i>) of section 24(2) of the 1948 Act requiring him to remedy a breach of a term or condition of his tenancy, being a notice requiring the doing of any work of repair, maintenance or replacement; and it is hereby declared, for the avoidance of doubt, that the expression ' work or repair, maintenance or replacement ' includes any work required to remedy dilapidation or deterioration of, or damage to, any part of the holding or anything in or on the holding caused by non-fulfilment by the tenant of his responsibilities to farm in accordance with the rules of good husbandry".</p></blockquote>
This is a long amendment but a short point. The amendment is intended to make it clear that a notice to do such work as to remedy infestation by couch, which is not strictly the repair or maintenance of fixed equipment, or at least may not be, is covered by this sort of notice. There has been a doubt about the position for some years. The reason why the amendment is framed as it is is that it is not merely an amendment to Clause 12 of the Bill, but also affects the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go into this matter in any greater detail. It is a legal point whether the maintenance of fixed equipment includes such things as living in the farmhouse, a point which very much affects me as a tenant farmer. I have considerable difficulties with my landlord over this, and he is very kind and helpful. It is something which may not be precisely defined as the law stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) for the helpful and friendly way in which he has put his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As he explained, this amendment is not solely an amendment to Clause 12. It affects the relevant provisions of the main legislation and, as such, I do not think it is an appropriate matter for this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the hon. Member's wish to have the position clarified. We will consider the issue with a view to amending legislation at all suitable opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disagreement between us. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), understandably on the basis of his deep and intimate knowledge of these matters and his great experience, has repeatedly referred to a general amendment, a complete overhaul of the agricultural holdings legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
I want to emphasise that there is no argument between us on this. This has not developed overnight. If we got down to it, we would find that there is complete agreement between the Ministry and all interested parties in the country on an enormous number of amendments to the existing legislation. But it is a big job. Re-writing this legislation is complex. It is all very well for hon. Members to say that a lawyer would make it simpler. I have a great regard for lawyers but my experience is that they never make a matter simpler or easier to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seized of the need to overhaul this legislation. Obviously 1 cannot give any firm commitments, any more than the previous Government were able to give firm commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Together we can do all that is possible to ensure that this matter is attended to by this or a future Government. The hon. Member has raised another of those many points which would be more appropriately handled in a general overhaul of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Minister says about the problem here. Consultation, as far as my memory goes, has been taking place for something like 15 years over this matter. I believe that 15 major items and many other minor items have been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But is it not possible that this uncertainty—an uncertainty which has often worried me, acting for landlord or for tenant—could be removed in the context of Clauses 11 and 12 by the amendment? I am not a lawyer. I do not pretend to know whether these words are correct but they have been suggested by people advised by the Agricultural Law Association. I believe that they would be an improvement. I realise that for the rest of Bill we shall have to leave matters until that can be overhauled. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors believes that it could be remedied by this amendment and uncertainty removed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has rightly—because presumably he must have a conscience about it—tried to explain the Government's position about amending the agricultural land holdings legislation. He was right to respond to my hon. Friends the Members for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) and Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and, indeed, to all hon. Members on this side of the Committee in their rational demand about this complicated legislation. I have not brought my books with me today, but members of the Committee will have seen the volume of legislation involved—not only Acts but amending orders and regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last night I spoke to a leading barrister who specialises in these matters. He said that keeping up with this law required constant access to proceedings in the House and that things were being altered little by little all the time. We agree that this law requires a proper revision. This piffling little Bill is not the right vehicle for such a revision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 11 and 12 have been placed before us. We have agreed that although Clause 11 is not necessary—and the Minister never justified the necessity for it—it was not something about which the Opposition need become over-excited. However, since then it has been put to us that a major revision of the law—any other description of the proposed new clause would be wrong—is now to be introduced into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall debate the merits or otherwise of the new clause when we come to it. You would rule me out of order, Mr. Costain, if I were to expand my views of what the Minister has already said. However, it is not a fair argument for the Minister to say to me, as he has on at least two of the last three amendments, "Yes, you have a good point, but this is not a Bill in which it is suitable to make small amendments to this law." The logicality of his statement escapes me. The hon. Gentleman is logical and he knows full well that he is wrong in the stand that he takes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would be supported by the Opposition if they were to say, " We will take away these changes to the agricultural land holdings law. We will not promise you that we will not bring
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
them back again, but we will take them out of this Bill and will come back with a complete revision." It only has to be taken off the shelf. The Minister has already said that his own officials, the country landowners, the National Farmers Union, the chartered surveyors and the Agricultural Law Association have already met and that these amendments are there, agreed and understood. I assure the Minister that we would not oppose a revision of that law. Far from it. We would welcome a look into the whole matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult for me to try and argue that the clause should stand part of the Bill. It should not. The Minister must come clean on this. The truth is that all the independent advice, from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers and the Agricultural Law Association has told the Minister that Clause 12 is not required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister says that the NFU wants the clause he must weigh up the relative technical capacity of the various bodies that have given their views on the matter. If we ignore the professional advice given by the people who have to administer the law the Government will have to make out a much stronger case than they have done for the retention of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought it reasonable to say that they have put in Clause 11 to prevent harassment of tenants. They should not press Clause 12 on this occasion but put it on the list of other minor amendments which should be looked at and included in future legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not crow over such a sensible decision. I hope that the Minister will use his discretion and wisdom to overrule those who might advise him otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to hold up our proceedings unduly, but I must say a few words about what the clause will do. The law at the moment says that a tenant who has received a notice to remedy which has expired is liable to receive a notice to quit if he has not complied with the notice to remedy in every respect. In other words, the landlord is entitled to give a tenant notice even if he has only missed the odd chain of hedging or ditching and has done the great majority of the work. This is subject only to the rule of law 	<i>de minimis non curat lex</i> which, for the benefit of the hon. Gentleman who clearly is unable to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
cope with that, as I am, means that a trifling defect of no consequence will be overlooked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the tenant is entitled at notice to quit stage to challenge the landlord's contention that the work has not been done and to challenge the reasonableness of the time allowed to him. At that stage, having had his opportunity at notice to remedy stage he is not entitled to challenge his liability to have done the work or the reasonableness of the time at the outset unless he did not avail himself of his opportunity to an arbitration at notice to remedy stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An arbitrator is not entitled at notice to quit stage to award that the notice to quit is unreasonable, with the result that a tenant, who may well be farming the holding reasonably well but who has slipped up in some respect which is more than a mere triviality on the notice to remedy, can be deprived of his holding by the existing notice to quit following notice to remedy procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present law is thought to work an injustice to tenants, if overall their farming standards are adequate or good, but who slip up on a few items in a long series of obligations listed in a notice to remedy and are then confronted with an incontestable notice to quit. As 1 understand it, Clause 12, instead of merely giving to an arbitrator a discretion whether to uphold or reject the notice to quit on the basis of its reasonableness, provides instead for the arbitration procedures to remain unchanged, but for a further hearing to be necessary if the arbitrator has upheld the notice to quit and the tenant then gives a counter-notice after that arbitration or, alternatively, a counter-notice at notice to quit stage rather than a demand for arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances the clause would entitle the tenant to remain in possession of the farm and for the notice to quit to be of no effect unless the Agricultural Land Tribunal consents to its operation, which it will be obliged to do unless it considers that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will enable the Lord Chancellor to make regulations which will have the effect of ensuring that, if an arbitrator finds at notice to quit stage that the time for doing the work specified in the notice to remedy should be extended and if the tenant still does not do the work within
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
the extended time and a new notice to quit is given, the reference to the Agricultural Land Tribunal and all those procedures will still be available to the tenant following the new notice to quit. This will also apply if the arbitrator decides that the new notice to quit should not be for a full 12-month period, but that the tenant should have a shorter period for quitting because of all the time he has had during the notice to remedy procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need hardly add that if Clause 11 becomes part of the law, and 1 see no reason why it should not, there can be no need for this particular clause. It can only be a bad tenants' charter. Whatever there may be between us on either side of the Committee we have agreed consistently that we do not want a bad tenants' charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction by the clause of the right to require the landlord to obtain the Agricultural Land Tribunal's consent to the operation of a notice to quit can only avail the tenant who has unjustifiably failed to comply with a notice to do work. Where a tenant justifiably fails to comply with a work notice either the work notice or the notice to quit will be knocked out by arbitration before the Agricultural Land Tribunal stage is reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present arbitration procedure, plus Clause 11, will enable the tenant, before doing any work, to ensure that every item in the work notice is not only lawful but necessary and justified and that a reasonable time is given to do it. There can be no argument about that; it is absolutely clear. We now understand Clause 11 and there is no need to go back over that ground. It is now embodied in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even so, we are adding yet another safeguard for the tenant. By this clause he can go to arbitration to challenge any notice to quit served for non-compliance with a work notice. If the landlord wins that arbitration he still has to go through further proceedings before the tribunal, which will have a discretion whether to allow the notice to quit to operate. The landlord can, therefore, win two arbitrations, prove his grounds before the tribunal and still be left with the work undone and no sanction against the defaulting tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not justice. It is quite the reverse. I accept that there must be a weight one way or the other, that we have to take some decisions in favour of the landlord, and some in favour of the tenant.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
But this is blatantly against the landlord, who has pursued the matter not only through well-established procedures but through the new procedures of Clause 11. It will operate so much against the landlord that, in the interests of justice alone, we are unable to support the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that, in such circumstances, the ALT will inevitably give consent to the notice to quit because a fair and reasonable landlord would properly insist on possession. But this points out the absurdity of the requirement to go to the tribunal. Only with a bad tenant would it get that far. The danger of giving a bad tenant this extra protection is that it will enable the bad farmer, who has ruined himself and his holding, to postpone the evil day of quitting by harassing his landlord with proceedings, while the holding deteriorates further and legal costs are run up, which the tenant may well be unable to pay. That already happens, to some degree, under the existing law. But Clause 12 gives the impecunious or inefficient farmer more scope for running down his holding with impunity. That is quite straightforward and easily understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the Minister made no case for the inclusion of Clause 11 within the Bill. Nevertheless, it is going forward to be reported to the House as part of the Bill. The Minister must make a special case for Clause 12. It is against all professional advice. The Agricultural Law Association's letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 12 (besides producing a possible fourth hearing) would result under subclause (4) in a Tribunal decision on one criterion only (fair and reasonable landlord not insist t) if there is a Notice to Quit in alternative form, but in decisions based on two different criteria, (the other being in section 25(1)), if instead of an alternative Notice two separate Notices to Quit are given at the same time."</p></blockquote>
The Association, too, is against the inclusion of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat my plea. There is not an unanswerable case for the inclusion of the clause. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear in mind another factor. Although the lawyers have faithfully and rightly advised the Government against the inclusion of the clause, they are overjoyed at the thought of the extra fees that they will earn as a result of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no money in agricultural law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
Friend that if the clause is included there will be a great deal more. The lawyers know full well that the extra hearing will help to line their pockets. It is an expensive procedure. I hope that, in the honest pursuit of justice, the Minister will think again. We should not oppose him if he were to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Westonsuper-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) on putting the matter in such a comprehensive way. I do not think it could have been better put. I rise only to emphasise that this is a bad tenants' charter and has received almost universal condemnation from the professional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is supposed to deal with harassment. I suggest that the only people to be harassed as a reulst of it will be the landlords. The clause gives a tenant who is blatantly running down his farm and is not complying with his tenancy agreement the opportunity to drag matters out. If one sees a run-down farm and discovers that it is run down as a result of what has been going on between the landlord and his tenant, one will be able to place a notice on the farm saying " This is the result of Clause 12 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support the excellent presentation of my hon. Friend the member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin). I hope that the Minister, who has latterly shown a certain amount of understanding and sympathy to the reasonable points made by the Committee, will take on board the plea of my hon. Friend to give 100 per cent. more thought to this matter and then withdraw the clause altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) was right to say that this is not about the harassment of tenants. It would produce a situation where the landowner is being harassed. I find objectionable the attitudes taken by Labour Members of the Committee. They automatically assume that the landowner is a powerful person with lots of money and influence. I have come across one or two cases in my own constituency where the landlord or landowner—call him or her what you will—is considerably worse off financially than the tenant. This is often the case. If a bad tenant is allowed to run down a farm and to drag out the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
whole procedure through the proposals in the clause, that means that this is had legislation. Parliament should have nothing to do with it, and the Government should open their eyes before it is too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare, whose statement was confirmed by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, said that professional advice within the industry was that the clause was bad and unnecessary, and should not be included. Why are the Government proceeding with the clause after all the advice which they have received?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the NFU has not condemned the clause. The NFU has perhaps seen some advantage in it. We all respect the NFU, but it is only one of many bodies involved with agriculture, and perhaps in this sphere it is less expert than the other bodies who have condemned the clause as irrelevant, unnecessary and positively harmful to agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has shown great understanding of the situation and has said that he is prepared to reconsider matters between now and Report. My hon. Friend has presented an excellent, well-documented case, supported by those who know the legal implications of land and agriculture. The Minister would show considerable sense and responsibility if he said—and we would not crow about it—that in the light of what has been said the Government will withdraw the clause from the Bill. It is unnecessary. It will be a had tenants' charter, and not to the advantage of farming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 support everything that has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), although his comment about the National Farmers' Union ought to be tempered by the thought that the NFU, by its very nature, seeking to represent almost everyone in agriculture, fails on occasions like this to express a single view representative of the whole industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the NFU is really talking entirely about Clause 11. 1 do not think that it is commenting about Clause 12 at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the first time that it has put two clauses together, and I do not apportion too much blame to it for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
My criticism of the clause and of the Government's conduct is that this is a wonderful opportunity to deal with the whole law of agricultural holdings, which is now an absolute mess. One of the messiest parts of it relates to the Government's own holdings and those that are managed by county councils. It is high time we had a single Bill dealing with the law relating to agricultural holdings. I hope to hear whether the Minister has any ideas about this. Will he be complacent and say " We need not worry. We have dealt with this piecemeal over the years, and are quite satisfied that no changes are needed?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister has memories of the Wise Report and knows that in the last few years the 	<i>raison d'etre</i> of agricultural smallholdings has almost come to an end. One by one the rungs of the ladder have been taken away, and once one gets into one of these smallholdings, there one almost has to stay. I am sure that my two hon. Friends who have sat on smallholdings committees will bear this out. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) must do so, as I live near to some of the holdings that he has been responsible for. The tenants are old men now and cannot get off first rung of the ladder. I do not think that the Ministry understands how important this is. It may be that it is out of touch with the county councils, and that its only experience[	<i>Interruption</i>]—I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is not sneering. It is not in his nature to do so. But if his Ministry is in touch with the experiences of county land agents and what is now going on in smallholdings, he should be persuaded that now is the time for a comprehensive change in the law on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone with any experience of the subject must he persuaded of that, but I fear that the Ministry is limited to its personal experience of managing its two smallholdings estates—both in my constituency—one of some 5,500 acres and the other of 1,000 acres, making 6,500 acres altogether. Those are very large holdings. The Ministry's experiences may give it a wrong impression of the future of smallholdings and of what is going on in other parts of the country. Perhaps the tenants there have not been vocal enough. Therefore I have not been vocal enough on their behalf in making it plain to the Minister that there is now a need for a change in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that this opportunity has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
missed, with the result that we now have Clauses 11 and 12 which together will not really help matters. The only beneficiary is the tenant who is trying to drag his feet. Perhaps he may have suffered some misfortune. He may have been sick for a period of time. He may, like so many farmers, have gone through a bad period financially. But the tenants who are not of the best are those who will benefit from Clauses 11 to 12. Therefore I, for one, regret very much that these clauses have been inserted. I regret enormously the Government's attitude in presenting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the general theme of my hon. Friend the Member for Holland-with-Boston (Mr. Body) about the compartmentising of farming today. It is almost impossible to move from the lowest rung, except when agricultural smallholdings are gradually amalgamated. This means that there are fewer holdings but still more people wanting to come in on the bottom. it is an impossibility for more to move on up to a hired farm because there are no farms to let. That is made much worse by the recently-introduced taxation system. There is no getting away from it, this is the death knell, not just of agricultural holdings but of farming in this country. I fear that the dead hand of bureaucracy and large pension funds is becoming too heavy in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see the reason for Clause 12. I do not mind how much the Minister argues for it. I cannot now see the reason for it at all. Clause 11 has been passed. I cannot see the reason for it. I believe, as my hon. Friend has just stated, that it will be part of a charter for the very bad tenants. We do not want that. We should be thinking of the farm, not the landlord or the tenant, but the farm and the food production. In my opinion, this is the way to look at the whole of agriculture. There is no doubt but that it will add to delay. If it adds to delay, it will add to expense and it will do no good whatsoever to anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say that there are advisers, be they lawyers or land agents, who will advise landlords or tenants, or both, to carry on with every appeal open to them. If there is another rung on the ladder of appeal—which seem to be the only ladder left—I am afraid that we shall find that in these cases of bad tenants extreme steps will be taken to no purpose whatever
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
except that the land will be farmed in a worse fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the greatest respect for the Agricultural Lands Tribunal in my part of the world. I was on the winning side in a big case before it. In that case the tenant was the big man, with 14,000 acres and the landlord was the little man with 2,000 acres. He wanted to get back 500 acres which lay right at the heart of his estate. I am sorry to refer to it, but the Celtic fringe does not realise that this sort of thing goes on in the Midlands and in East Anglia where all the country's food is produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found that we are well served by an Agricultural Lands Tribunal which is itself served extremely well by a chairman who has taken a great deal of interest in agriculture. I was on the telephone this morning to a well-known agricultural values in the North of England who said that the general opinion was that Agricultural Lands Tribunals are not properly constituted to deal with these cases. In many cases they do not properly understand the intricacies of the Agricultural Holdings Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is touching on an important point. I should perhaps have mentioned it in my speech. When the 1948 Act was first introduced the Agricultural Lands Tribunals met frequently. Therefore, the lawyer-chairmen on the whole became familiar with the law. Would my hon. Friend not agree, with his experience, that because the Tribunals are asked to do fewer tasks now, and because the practice of agricultural law is not as widely spread as many other branches, the Agricultural Lands Tribunals are increasingly ceasing to be proper courts in that the lawyer-chairmen do not get the practice and briefing that they should?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with that, although I am not pretending to be somebody who is now in practice. I am in touch with people who are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope that the Minister will look at this matter again. If on an issue such as this, which is closely concerned with practical matters affecting the livelihoods of landlords and tenants, he receives professional advice that is all on one side he ought to take that into consideration. The Minister has shown that he fully appreciates some of the points
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>
which have been raised. This is not a question of having to wait until the Agricultural Holdings Act is overhauled it is a matter which could easily wait until then. I do not believe that it would do anybody any harm - but it would do a lot of good—if Clause 12 were dropped from the Bill now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After what has been said by my hon. Friends, particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin), whose grasp of this complicated matter I can only describe as masterly—I hope the local papers in Weston-super-Mare get hold of that remark—there is little more to be said. However, I must say that the Parliamentary Secretary, during our debate on the amendments had a bit of a cheek to tell us that this was not a Bill in which to make small amendments. In view of the provisions of Clauses 11, 12, 13 and 14 and the proposed new clause—which we shall debate on another day—it is astonishing that the Minister should come here and tell us that. Is he telling us that this is a Bill in which to make big amendments, but not little ones? It seems to me very strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Parliamentary Secretary replies to the debate I hope that he will agree to the withdrawal of the clause. If by any mischance that is not to be the Government's attitude the Minister has one important justification to make for the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must tell us, if he is intent on leaving Clause 12 in the Bill, how a case such as that put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Westonsuper-Mare could possibly get back to the Agricultural Land Tribunal except through the medium of a bad tenant. That sums it up. The Minister must explain how that could come about other than through a tenant who was, by all yardsticks, a bad one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us at the last sitting that it is no part of the Government's policy to create a bad tenants' charter. That is the yardstick by which we shall judge his answer, if by mischance, the Government are insistent, against all professional advice. My hon. Friend referred in his speech to the attitude of the National Farmers Union. It was interesting to refresh my mind after hearing the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon)
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
about what the National Farmers Union has said about Clause 12. Page 2 subpara (	<i>a</i>) of the brief which it sent out on 26th November, is devoted to Clause 11 which we have already debated. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Union welcomes the provisions contained in Clauses 11 and 12 in the Bill which will give some necessary strengthening to tenant farmers' security of tenure in relation to statutory notices to do work served by agricultural landlords."</p></blockquote>
In the remaining part of the two paragraphs on the page I can see very little which applies to Clause 12. Therefore, if the Minister says that Clause 12 must remain in the Bill, the Government are alone in this view. I have not seen any view from anybody else. If the NFU has made another pronouncement specifically on Clause 12 no doubt the Minister will tell us. Perhaps the NFU has had other views which it has expressed on this. I have not been able to trace any. We shall listen with every great care to what the Parliamentary Secretary says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The background to all comments by Tory Members on both these clauses is that they do not accept that there is a harassment problem. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) went to great lengths at the last sitting to argue that there was no problem here. Once again in the course of his remarks he has said that there is no justification whatever for the Government introducing this legislation which, although it is rather a hotchpotch, deals with a number of important and pressing items affecting the agricultural industry. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) cannot acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may return to the basic point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will remember that during Second Reading I said that I had come across one or two cases of harassment but I did not consider that bad cases made good law and generally speaking I did not consider that this was necessary. We accepted Clause 11. I am merely saying that Clause 12 is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am sorry. Perhaps I had not made myself clear. I am referring to the hon. Gentleman's statement that the Bill was ill-conceived and that it would be better to amend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
agricultural holdings legislation which indicated that he did not appreciate the value of some of the important items in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Might I briefly go over the background to this legislation? Tenants have complained of unreasonably long lists of work numbering 386 items, 321 items, 182 items—I could continue. Others were described in more general terms. one description being " a massive list". Tenants have also complained that some of the items, though legally their responsibility, were either frivolous, unnecessary or unjustified, and some that the requirements entailed unnecessarily heavy expenditure. Others alleged that their landlords, while compelling their tenants to do the work, had failed to carry out their own obligations as regards the maintenance, replacement or repair of items which were their legal responsibility. All complaints alleged the misuse by the landlords of the notice to do work procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence on this is corroborated by information from arbitrators on the Lord Chancellor's Panel who told my officials that they had to arbitrate on cases where they knew—and I stress this—that the landlord was misusing the notice to do work and was harassing his tenant. They were powerless to stop him because of their lack of any power of discretion. The NFU has told us, and no doubt told some hon. Members opposite as well, that it also knows of isolated cases which have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-superMare made great play of the fact that the Government had not brought forward any examples. Obviously, in these instances any Minister is reluctant to describe an example lest it be attributed and people find out which case it is. But I have been thinking about this, and I will give an example to hon. Members opposite to finish once and for all this argument that there is no basis and no need for this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is on Clause 11?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It affects Clause 12 as well. Let me quote from two documents. Obviously I am not prepared to divulge the writer's name and address. My officials questioned this farmer at the time. He admits that he should have gone to arbitration on the notice to do
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
work but, to quote his own words, he was so horrified by the list of work to be done that he did not even read the notes for guidance attached to the notice but straight-away started to try to do the work demanded of him. He had to stop all farming activities but, even so, failed to complete the work in the time allowed. He was subsequently served with a notice to quit on which he went to arbitration. The arbitrator found that several items had not been completed in the time allowed and upheld the notice to quit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already stated that in a proportion of instances the tenant has gone to arbitration on the basis of the notice to do work. But the important point is that the discretion given to the arbitrator is limited. The hon. Member also knows that in this case the man went to arbitration on the notice to quit but lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is misleading the Committee. It is no good saying that this is an example and then admitting that the tenant had not used the statutory procedure. That was the whole point of our argument—that if the tenant used the statutory procedure there was no need for Clause 12. To get up and quote a case and say that it is an example, and then to admit that the tenant did not use the protection available to him, proves our case. We are very grateful to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being a little disingenuous. If the hon. Member thinks that this is quite desirable and is quite happy that this has happened, fair enough. He can defend it. But I am quite sure that the vast majority of reasonable people would agree with us on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me quote from a letter from this gentleman to the Minister and then from a subsequent document. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was served a notice to remedy by my landlords. Some of the items in the order were so ridiculous it was unbelievable that a reasonable man should have ordered them to he done. Later, the man who sent the notice finished up by taking his own life by the gun.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In particular, one item of the notice to remedy was to dig, scour out, etc., a hollow between my boundary and the next farm approximately 200 yards in length, to culvert it with 14 inch salt-glazed socket pipes, in some places six feet underground, with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
six feet square brick manholes going down for inspection. To carry out this would be a mammoth and unnecessary task."</p></blockquote>
I will not read any more from that letter. Let me read from the letter from the land agent to the county office of the NFU It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would say that if Mr. X's tenancy is at risk because of my alleged deficiencies in his husbandry then no tenant farmer in England is safe today. The items on which Mr. X is held to be at fault to such a degree that the extreme step of ending his tenancy is being attempted by his landlord fall into three main groups: hedging and fences, gates and posts, and weeds."</p></blockquote>
The land agent goes on to explain that he found
	<br><blockquote><p>"all the field work boundaries in good order."</p></blockquote>
Let me come to the point on which the hon. Member for Weston-superMare is mistaken. He is under the impression that a landlord can no longer require a tenant to lay a hedge. That is wrong. A landlord can still require that of the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said—and I hesitate to get involved on a point of such precise detail, but it was quoted in a letter to me—was that the arbitrator has some discretion if it is not the local practice to require laying of hedges, and he certainly will have under Clause 11. I am much more disturbed by the general point which the hon. Gentleman is making. If the hon. Gentleman makes a speech outside this place and someone sues him he has a protection in law. He can go to a court, and therefore he is not frightened. But would it be fair to say that he was being harassed? I do not think that he is being harassed any more than a tenant is if a landlord serves a notice and the tenant then fails to take up the protection that is available to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly misleading of the hon. Gentleman to read out passionate letters. I could say on occasions that I was being harassed by my constituents, as I am sure all hon. Members could. I can either make a speech in my defence or seek the protection of the law. That is the point we are trying to make, and I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is doing his argument any good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon, Gentleman satisfied about this case? Incidentally, what gives it a special significance is that
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
the land is to be compulsorily purchased, and under the statutory compensation code the landlord is required to pay a sitting tenant between five and six years' rent as compensation. But this tenant who has been forced to quit the holding because of failing to comply with the notice to do work is no longer eligible for disturbance compensation, nor will he be eligible for any of the other payments apart from the tenant rights. The landlord on the other hand will be without a tenant and will be able to sell his land for development with vacant possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My knowledge of agricultural law is nowhere near as great as that of those who brief the Minister, but is it not true that any landlord, as the law stands, can get possession of his land for development, because that is one of the so-called seven deadly sins? My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) will agree with me about that. I know that compensation comes into it, but I think it would be wrong to make the point—if that was the point the hon. Gentleman was making—that because the landlord had got rid of the tenant he could then sell the land for development. He could do that anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point I am making. My point is that it was reprehensible if the landlord went to those lengths to get rid of a tenant to avoid paying compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. Surely we are getting away from the point. I am glad that the Minister has tried to justify these cases, and I can understand that there are,cases of harassment. But we are discussing Clause 12 and whether the case should go to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. It seems to me that we are now discussing Clause 11 all over again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. It is a point of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal with this point. We had to be very careful in selecting an example not to pick a case in which particular individuals could be identified. The hon. Member for Westonsuper-Mare has sought to suggest that my case is totally destroyed by the fact that the tenant did not go to arbitration
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
on the notice to do work, although, naturally, he went to arbitration on the notice to quit. Even given that situation, I would describe that as harassment. I regard it as a state of affairs which we should seek to avoid, and believe that we are justified in introducing legislation to so do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is not true that invariably people do not go to arbitration. I could go to great lengths and find a case where an individual had gone to arbitration on the notice to do work. But I do not see how the hon. Member can suggest that there is no problem here because the person concerned did not go to arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that in the case he has just quoted the tenant failed to use the remedy open to him in law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the tenant would have been well advised to go to arbitration on the notice to do work. What I do not accept is that had he done so he would not have been served with a notice to quit at the end of the day. We have taken the advice of professional people. If the hon. Member thinks that the situation I described is satisfactory—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not making the best of his argument. I am not sure that I am on the same wavelength as my colleagues. The most powerful argument is that the tenant did not seek the legal remedy open to him because to an ordinary person the emotional upset of being confronted with such a list of things to do must be absolutely bewildering and overwhelming. I appreciate that a man would be completely confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is written on the form what he should do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A case in my constituency raised the question of the format of the notice to quit and how it can be improved. These details have not been gone into, as far as I am aware. I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary is making the best of his point. He should concede that the legal remedy had not been resorted to and describe why, in circumstances such as I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
described, the formal method is not necessarily the right answer in this kind of situation. I would go a long way towards meeting him on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. I think that we are on the same wavelength. I take his point that we should look at the form again and after the passage of the Bill we shall have to do so. I agree with the hon. Member that the first thing the tenant sees is the long list of things he has to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1963 Order lays down that the notice to remedy shall contain advice as to what the tenant can do. The hon. Gentleman has just said that he will have another look at that. I hope that that is not a Government promise, because the procedure is well understood and if he is to mess about with that Order as well I am sure it would cause even further alarm among those who have to handle this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was the Minister entirely agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton)? The basis of my hon. Friend's argument was that the present situation was all right if the form of the notice to remedy was altered to clarify the rights of the tenant on whom the notice was being served. If that is so, why are we proceeding with the clause, when a minor adjustment to the presentation of the notice to remedy would be sufficient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is suggesting that a minor adjustment would be sufficient. I think it was not unreasonable for the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) to make this point. All I have said is that we shall look at the lay-out of the form, but we are not suggesting that that will solve the problem, nor did the hon. Gentleman imply that. He is concerned about what can happen in practice, and that in itself is sufficient justification for the Government to introduce legislation where it will alleviate the hardship I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The security of tenure provisions constitute one of the most important points of the 1948 Act. In effect, a tenant under full agricultural tenancy, who regularly pays his rent, observes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
the conditions of his tenancy agreement and farms his land properly, has security of tenure for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 25 of the 1948 Act, a landlord may apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for consent to the operation of a notice to quit within the contestable category. Provided he proves his case, a 	<i>prima facie</i> reason is established as to why he should regain possession. But the Tribunal finally applies the " fair and reasonable landlord " test before giving that consent—that is, it must withold consent to the operation of a notice to quit if, in all the circumstances, it appears to it that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that hon. Gentlemen should be so opposed to the application of a " fair and reasonable landlord " test in those circumstances. I am also surprised at their statements about the position of the NFU. Of course we do not do something because the CLA, the NFU, or the NUAAW asks us, but we take seriously into account any advice they may give. The NFU brief, which was circulated to us, made the position quite clear. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Union welcomes the provisions contained in Clauses 11 and 12 in the Bill".</p></blockquote>
To suggest that the Union did not mean Clause 12, but meant only Clause 11, is rather insulting. During the consultations on harassment the NFU expressed the view that a further desirable safeguard for the tenant over and above the changes in an arbitrator's powers would be secured by providing a right of challenge by the tenant at the notice to quit stage on the grounds that he used all reasonable endeavours to comply with the notice to work and that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession. I cannot see how hon. Members who are opposed to that provision expect to have much support throughout the industry. The Government are grateful for the advice the NFU gave them on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that under Clause 11 the arbitrator will apply the " fair and reasonable landlord " criterion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Member surely knows that the arbitrator will have before him the notice to do work list and he will be required to take a
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
decision on the notice to quit on the basis of that. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member not accept that, when the matter goes to arbitration, the arbitrator is required to go on the basis of what is in the notice to do work and whether, assuming adequate time has elapsed, the work has been done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has challenged me. As I understand it, the arbitrator will apply the fair and reasonable landlord test, as he will apply his own judgment, since the passage of Clause 11, to the notice to remedy. If that is not the case I am mistaken, and I am willing to stand corrected, but surely that is what we have just passed in Clause 11. The hon. Gentleman is making out a case for Clause 11, not Clause 12. We are debating Clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. I hope that he will take advice from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, when he will find that he is absolutely mistaken on this point. Clause 11 has simply given the arbitrator the powers to remove items from the notice to do work when the tenant refers it to him at an early stage. Having done so and having been left with the list, after arbitration, when the landlord serves a notice to quit on the basis of the notice to do work not having been complied with, the arbitrator is required to arbitrate on the basis whether the work has been done according to that list. He is not empowered to apply any fair and reasonable landlord test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister put himself in the place of an arbitrator faced with a short list, a long list or a medium length list of repairs to be done? Would a reasonable landlord insist upon the tenant thatching the barn when one end of it already has corrugated iron on it? Is it reasonable that all the gateways between arable land should have gates and posts put up again? The whole attitude of mind of the arbitrator must be to ask: " Would a fair and reasonable landlord insist on this being done?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a different point. Either he accepts or he does not accept that the Agricultural Land Tribunal alone is empowered to decide whether a fair and reasonable landlord would insist on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
possession. I am sure he knows from his own experience that that is a test applied by the ALT, not the arbitrator. Of course, the arbitrator will look at the list and see whether the items are reasonable. That is not in dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not accept that the amendments amount to a rogues' charter for tenants. The chairman and members of the Agricultural Land Tribunal are experienced men. The chairman is a barrister or solicitor of no less than seven years' standing in his profession. The chairman for the case appoints the two members from the Lord Chancellor's panels of persons nominated by the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners Association to represent the interests of farmers and landowners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the life of me, I cannot see how hon. Gentlemen can regard this clause—whereby a tenant will be able in the last resort, on a crucial matter, namely, a notice to quit, to appeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal—as unacceptable or biased in favour of the landlord, or a charter for a bad tenant. That is preposterous. The Agricultural Land Tribunal is a reasonable body and it is appropriate that it should be the final arbitrator in deciding whether a tenant should quit his holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the greatest possible pity that the Parliamentary Secretary in the debate on Clause 11 stand part, did not tell us many of the things he has told us in this debate. That is the information we were asking for. He must have known we would want explanations then. He now tells us, when we are debating Clause 12, that he has had second thoughts and will give more details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary should realise that the case he read out to us was not what we were asking for. I refer him to remarks I made—quite apart from similar remarks by my hon. Friends—on Tuesday, when I asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Will he tell us the cases in which the Ministry thinks that harassment has occurred, where counter-notice has been served, and what the grounds for harassment were in those cases? "—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C;</i> 17th February 1976, 	<i>c.</i> 642–6431</p></blockquote>
That is not what he told us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
The Opposition are anxious to avoid repetition of the sort of case the Minister read out to us. It was a horrifying case. But that is why we did not oppose Clause 11. We said that if there was danger of such injustice occurring we would not oppose Clause 11, although we were not given the justification for it which we were, in part, given today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still awaiting an answer to the main question we put during that debate as to where the harassment occurred when a counter-notice was served and arbitration followed. The Parliamentary Secretary said today that if he looks carefully he may be able to find a case where harassment occurred after the matter had been to arbitration. Does he mean that he has brought this legislation without bothering to find out whether there were cases of harassment after the case had been to arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the case to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred is a tragic one, is not the Parliamentary Secretary scraping the barrel to draw such an example to our attention? He indicated that the landowner in question ultimately took his own life, which shows that this is an extraordinary case and not an example which would substantiate the Parliamentary Secretary's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is right. The whole gist of what the Parliamentary Secretary said this morning is that if a man is faced with an injustice, he is presented with the opportunity of remedying that injustice by going to arbitration. If he does not choose to go to arbitration, it is said that we must have this change in the law. That is like saying that if a man is wrongly accused of a crime and finds himself arraigned in the courts accused of a crime which he feels he can prove that he did not commit, he does not use the remedy and opportunity which the court gives him to prove his innocence. The Minister is saying that the man meekly goes to court and, because he has been accused, pleads guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument of the Government is rather similar in that kind of a case. The Minister has not yet answered the question which we have put to him during the course of this debate. He must tell us how it is possible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
that a case can get to the Agricultural Land Tribunal except through a thoroughly bad tenant who is not fulfilling his obligations. The Government have said that they would not wish to shield such a tenant. What are these cases which will slip through? My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), who has more experience over these matters than any of us here, has told us that an arbitrator would take all the considerations of the good landlord test into consideration. His evidence makes it clear that it is unnecessary to the Tribunal. To me that is convincing. I am prepared to go further and say to the Parliamentary Secretary, " If you insist on having these provisions in Clause 12, justify them. Tell us what these cases are which might slip through the arbitrators. Tell us how it is possible to justify a case going through the safety net procedure of the Agricultural Land Tribunal, which is an expensive and time-consuming matter". I do not understand this reasoning and we must have a better response from the Government if we are to understand what they are about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the debate on the clause would not take very long. 'The Minister's statement has muddied the waters to such an extent that we must take up the point he made about the fair and reasonable landlord. After the long debate on Clause 11, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The clause enables additional powers to be conferred on an arbitrator. These will give him discretion, which he currently lacks, to modify a notice to do work. He will be empowered to delete from a notice any item or part of an item which he considers to be unnecessary or unjustified in the interest of good husbandry of the holding to which the notice relates, or sound management of the estate of which the holding forms part, or to substitute a different method or material."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 17th February 1976, 	<i>c.</i> 631.]</p></blockquote>
If that is not the criteria of a fair and reasonable landlord, I do not know what is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help. The phrase " the fair and reasonable landlord test " is a sacrosanct one. It does not refer to specific items, but to the question of possession. That is what we are talking about in relation to ALT.
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) will confirm this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: must disagree with the Minister. Here we have a question of a notice to quit which arises from this section. The arbitrator has already gone into the whole question, which is the list of items. If the arbitrator decides every item, which he must obviously decide on the basis of his experience of what the fair and reasonable landlord would do, can the Minister cite a textbook example of what could slip past the net? He now says that this is a different phraseology which everyone understands. It relates in other circumstances to the Agricultural Holdings Act but surely not to Clauses 11 and 12. It relates only to the service of a notice to quit because the landlord has asked for what are considered to be unreasonable items. Section 11 has already given the arbitrator the opportunity to strike out all those items. Under this section in which the notice to quit arises, what more could the Agricultural Lands Tribunal expect a reasonable landlord to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members seem to be arguing that Clause 12 is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is doing better than the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on this side think otherwise. Do the Opposition Members believe that this clause will do harm? If they do not, there is nothing lost if it is left in the Bill. They also argue that we should legislate on a broader front and should be looking at the whole of the agricultural holdings legislation. I agree with the hon. Gentlemen that we should. It is necessary to have a closer look at this legislation, but that does not justify doing nothing at this stage. We should try to clear up some of the points. At the same time I urge my hon. Friend that Government should take a broader view for future legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tory Members said that there was no justification for this kind of legislation in the area they represented. They had witnessed no harassment. We say that there have been difficulties in other areas. I would be happy for Tory Members to allow the Government to proceed on these lines because it will not

	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
hurt life in their areas. Life will go on just as peacefully as in the past. Even if it is only one tenant in our areas who needs protection, let us protect him. I believe that hon. Members opposite have nothing to fear from the clause and they might as well allow it to remain in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to our previous argument that it is a long-stop. We must have protection. If one person is taking decisions, good though he may be, he is not God. There must be a right of appeal. I would urge Conservative Members to accept that Clause 12 is necessary in our eyes, even if it is not in theirs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratuate the hon. Gentleman the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) on appreciating the situation somewhat better than his own Front Bench. He did not hear his own Front Bench defend its opposition to one or two small amendments on the grounds that this Bill was not a suitable place for making small alterations.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have three small points to raise. First, at no time was the Minister able to justify why, against the advice of all the professional independent bodies, it was still necessary to pursue this matter.

	<p>sional advice on this matter to have been of the calibre that one would normally except from the National Farmers Union.</p>
	<p>On the question of the Agricultural Lands Tribunal, it is quite clear that we will have a debate about its structure when the new clause is tabled. The point I made was absolutely valid and serious, namely that because of the lack of use of Agricultural Lands Tribunals there is a difficulty, which those of us who administer the law have pointed out. I hope that the Government will take this on board when they are drafting their new clause, because there has to be a case—if we establish special courts—for those courts to be better in some way than the crown court, the county court or whatever may otherwise be available.</p>
	<p>Finally, I would say to the hon. Gentleman that his answer to my point on Clause 11 is farcical. The truth of the matter is that the case he produced—which he managed to identify very carefully by going a little further than his original brief—would not have come under Clause 11. If the tenant did not go to arbitration on the notice to remedy, the situation was as before. The only justification for Clause 12 is to deal with the tenant who is negligent of the procedures. He therefore completely mashed up his case and made my point, which is quite simple. He should justify this be producing a case. We are not prepared to oppose it if we think that that there is some chance of the law being better administered. We accept Clause 11 and then the hon. Gentleman comes up with a case to which Clause 11 would not even have applied. The Minister has made an even less good case for Clause 12 than he did for Clause 11. So I hope that we shall vote against it.</p>

I am sorry that the Government have not seen fit to arrange for the Lord Advocate to attend. We may have struggled to interpret the English law but I am quite certain that we will struggle even further with Scottish law, since I, for one, am unfamiliar even with some of the terms used. It is reasonable to ask that we should have some expert on this. Perhaps the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), will be able to enlighten us about these complicated matters in due course. He knows about everything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A great deal of fuss was made about the fact that I claimed to be more authoritative about what happened in the English countryside than the Opposition. I accept this. I will be generous on this point. I will not challenge hon.

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in a difficulty because Clauses 13 and 14 are the exact photocopies, in Scottish law, of Clauses 11 and 12. The basic arguments are to
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
be the same. I do not propose to prolong the work of the Committee by going over all the ground we have been over before, which will no doubt be a considerable relief to the Minister. When he replies perhaps he will, in consideration, make his replies as brief as I hope my comments will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Section 25(2)(	<i>e</i>) and (	<i>f</i>) of the 1949 Act the time to remedy all or any breach must be reasonable. Thus the arbiter already has a discretion to hold that the time allowed is unreasonable. As an example, had there been 12 breaches of a lease of which 11 had been remedied, it would still be possible for the arbiter to hold that the time for remedying the twelfth breach was unreasonable and thus preclude the serving of an incontestable notice to quit. The amendments that I have tabled deal with that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right when he says that these clauses seek to implement in Scottish law what we have agreed for England and Wales, although they go a little bit further than that. They make certain amendments to the Scottish position, which had previously been enacted in English legislation, particularly in 1963. It is just a matter of taking the opportunity to do one or two further minor things with regard to Scottish law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 113 would be to remove from the scope of the arbiter's powers the facility to make changes in the time allocated for the remedying of any breach of any term or condition of a tenancy by the doing of work of provision repair, maintenance or replacement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would disadvantage the Scottish tenant in comparison with his counterparts in England and Wales where arbitrators have had this power since 1964. It was to remedy this anomaly that we put forward this proposal in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing position is that an arbiter in Scotland can only arbitrate on the reasonableness or otherwise of a specified time for a specified job. Having given his opinion on whether the time is reasonable, he cannot do more. The new provisions would enable the arbiter himself to specify a time within which the work should be done. This can be different periods for different items under consideration. In doing this he can take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
account of all the circumstances, some of which may not have been foreseeable when the period was originally specified. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, having heard these remarks, will be happy to withdraw his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a technical matter, and we shall not press these amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to propose Amendment No. 116, in line 7, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall authorise the arbiter to delete any item in respect of which the tenant is under a statutory obligation in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the said Act of 1949."</p></blockquote>
I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks a few minutes ago in which be said that he thought it was desirable that Scottish law and English law should be aligned. I certainly would concur with that. There is a very good case for this, and indeed many other things, in both countries being brought roughly into line in terms of practice and usage. I shall argue that with greater passion on New Clause 4 and remind the hon. Gentleman of his statement, since I believe that that is a good example of where we shall be trying to line things up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 5 of the 1949 Act provides that there shall be deemed to be included in any lease of an agricultural holding:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a provision that the liability of the tenant in relation to the maintenance of fixed equipment shall extend only to a liability to maintain the fixed equipment on the holding in as good a state of repair (natural decay and fair wear and tear excepted) as it was in immediately after it was put in repair as aforesaid or, in the case of equipment provided, improved, replaced or renewed during the tenancy, as it was in immediately after it was so provided, improved, replaced or renewed."</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to ensure that this minimal statutory obligation of the tenant is not further eroded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can appreciate to some extent the intention of the amendment, namely, that the tenant should continue to be required to see that the fixed equipment remains, apart from wear and tear, in the same condition as it was when he took it over. But the whole point of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
changes we are now making in the law is to deal with the possible case where the landlord makes demands which fall within the statutory obligations of the tenant but which may, nevertheless, be regarded as being unnecessary or unjustified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arbiter could only delete an item if he is satisfied that it is unnecessary or unjustified—and before reaching this conclusion he has to take into account whether that item is required in the interests of good husbandry or sound estate management. There would probably be few cases where the works demanded by a landlord in respect of these obligations of the tenant would be either unnecessary or unjustified. But circumstances change and the occasion can arise where any reasonable person would conclude that work which just falls within the tenant's obligations is neither necessary nor justified. For example, he could in terms of his tenancy be required to keep in good condition a stone dyke, the maintenance of which might well have no value to his holding and could be inordinately expensive at today's prices or under present-day conditions but which, under the law, he could be held to be liable to repair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether, since this is a technical point, the Minister could speak louder. It would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By all means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Gentleman was listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not realised that my remarks were spoken that low. However, I hope that the hon. Member will in the circumstances see fit to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 117, in page 16, line 12, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it would be convenient, with your approval, Mr. Costain, if at the same time we discussed Amendment No. 118, page 16, line 28, leave out subsection (3). The removal of subsection (3) is consequential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is acceptable to the Committee, I agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2) is unnecessary since the arbiter will already have had an opportunity of exercising a discretion in relation to varying a time or times for remedying breaches. If the breaches have not been remedied at the expiration of such time or times the notice to quit should become incontestable without the intervention of the Land Court. The deletion of subsection (3) is consequential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would have the effect of removing from this clause the provision which allows the Land Court to be brought in to specify a date for the termination of the tenancy by notices to quit in the event of the tenant failing to do works within the period specified by the arbiter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had thought that the provision would indeed be helpful to the landlord, as it would allow the Land Court to fix a date for the termination of the tenancy which is to be not earlier than the date on which it could have been terminated if the landlord had given notice to quit on the expiry of the period originally specified in the demand or, if there was no period mentioned, on the date the demand was given. Alternatively, if this was later, the date may be fixed at six months after the expiry of the period specified by the arbiter or as extended by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This seems to me to achieve a fair balance between the interests of landlord and tenant. The tenant gets at least six months' notice from the end of the period he was given to do the work. On the other hand, the landlord will have to wait for a shorter period than if he had had to wait for the expiry of the period or the extended period fixed by the arbiter before being able to give his notice to quit. Therefore, I am sure that the hon. Member will want to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is probably right in saying that I will withdraw the amendment. It is extremely difficult for us to follow the precise line of argument since the matter is one of such great legal complexity. I hope, in due course, that Mr. Speaker will smile favourably upon amendments to these four clauses on Report, simply because of the difficulty of having to consult legal advisers over these complex matters. I appreciate that that is not a
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
ruling that you can give, Mr. Costain, but I should like it placed on the record, so that in due course the point can be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that our expeditious handling of these clauses will not be misread. It was in the desire to get on and, as I said in my opening remarks, we have been over the principle of this measure in some considerable detail. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 119, in page 17, line 8, leave out from beginning to end of line 11. The arbiter has already been given power to extend, and further extend, the time for remedying a breach. Is it not somewhat absurd and illogical to allow a further opportunity for extending time after his award has been made? To do so will create a much greater period of uncertainty, bring the whole arbitration procedure into ridicule and make it more protracted and, therefore, immensely expensive. This is a theme which we have pursued throughout our debates on previous clauses. I should have thought that the Minister might take a benign view of this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should say, since it arises particularly in relation to this amendment, that I understand that in bringing forward these clauses my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Scotland had in mind that it was desirable to bring the law in Scotland on these matters more closely into line with the law in England and Wales. These various provisions which we are discussing, so far as they are not paralleled in Clauses 11 and 12, are broadly equivalent to provisions which have been contained in the English law since the Agriculture (Notices to Remedy and Notices to Quit) Order 1964. The words which the hon. Gentleman wishes to delete are contained in Article 13(1) of that Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision deals with the situation where a tenant has been given notice to quit because of a breach of the conditions of his tenancy by failure to do works, and who then refers the notice to quit to arbitration under Section 27(2) of the 1969 Act. It is designed to meet the case where, owing to unforeseen circumstances, a time which was quite
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
reasonable when it was specified has become unreasonable. It enables the arbiter to extend the period in such cases. He must take into account the length of time which has elapsed since the service of the demand. I think that the hon. Gentleman, on reflection, will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add one comment. I defend the Bill as it stands and reject the amendment, not only on the grounds that the Bill brings Scotland into line with the English law in this matter but because it is right. We have all had a number of cases in which it has been difficult to fulfil the arbitration award because of all sorts of unforeseen circumstances. I hope that the Opposition will withdraw their amendment, because difficulties could arise. I insist again that the reason for having it is not, I hope, merely because we wish to run in parallel with the English law, but because it is manifestly just in its own right. I hope that Opposition Members will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Therefore, Mr. Costain, if I were not to pursue this matter, may I ask whether it would be in order to widen the clause stand part debate on Clause 14 since the two are so obviously closely connected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 120, in page 18, line 8, leave out from " quit " to end of line 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take a similarly questioning view of this clause as we did of Clause 12. We shall, in due course, presumably, oppose the inclusion of the clause. It gives so
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
much additional security of tenure that it would seem right that, if the landlord does apply to the Land Court for consent, it should be granted without further qualification. The additional security of a tenant comes on top of the lengthy arbitration machinery to which the notice to quit has already been subjected. To give the landlord further discretion in the matter cannot be necessary and can only lead to bad estate management and bad husbandry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In debating Clause 12 stand part, my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) reminded the Minister that at no time should it be the intention to create a bad tenants' charter. We are at one over this, and I am sure that this is right. It would be time wasting to repeat all these arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment which the hon. Member has proposed is a serious one and would make such a radical change in the clause that I cannot consider accepting it. Indeed, it would make the enactment of Clause 14 to a large extent meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are proposing in this clause is that, where a tenant is given a notice to quit for a failure to remedy a breach of the conditions of his lease—involving a failure to do works—the tenant has a right to give a counter notice and, if he does, the notice to quit will not have effect unless the Land Court consents. The effect of this is to transfer the type of notice to quit which we are considering from the incontestable to the contestable category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of subsection (4) is to give guidance to the Scottish Land Court as to the points which it is to take into account when such a notice to quit is referred to it. It is to consent unless it appears to it that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession. By deliting these words, the amendment would remove the indication of what the Land Court is to consider. The clause would then provide that the Land Court is to consent to any such notice referred to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would virtually remove the protection which the clause seeks to give to the tenant since there is little point in his serving a counter notice if the landlord has simply to refer it to the Land Court to ensure that it becomes effective.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree to such a course of action because I have already made it clear that we are diametrically opposed to the principle of the inclusion of this clause in the Bill. We do not believe that these procedures are necessary. We have not heard a good case made out that the procedures are necessary and, while I fully acknowledge that this is a destructive amendment, it seems to be absolutely in line with everything we have said. The hon. Gentleman has not argued a sufficiently powerful case to the contrary. Therefore, I do not intend to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene but I think that I should do so. I regard this as a destructive amendment. It is an amendment to try to remove the guts of the clause and no doubt this had better be discussed on clause stand part. It seems to me that, by the removal of this part of the clause, we are almost disqualifying the power of an arbitrator—we use a better word in Scotland, namely " arbiter "—to arbitrate at all. This is the whole balance of advantage here, the whole question of the relationship of the balance of advantage between tenant and landlord. This, in the final analysis, is where the justice comes.

No evidence has been produced, particularly from Scotland, to substantiate in any way the necessity for these two clauses. Since the Minister was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
attempting, albeit unsuccessfully, to be forthcoming about examples from England and Wales, my request remains precisely the same. Can he produce a case where the tenant has exhausted the statutory defences available to him and has still found himself subjected to what the Minister described as " harassment"? It would appear that the two clauses have been considered in total isolation from the balance between the landlord and tenant which was introduced by the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949. This Act followed exhaustive and lengthy discussions between the Department of Agriculture, the National Farmers Union, and the Scottish Landowners' Federation. Accordingly, a major change in the balance of the relationship between landlord and tenant should not be introduced in an Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Any major changes in this relationship should only be dealt with as part of a general review of the agricultural holdings legislation as a whole. This shows that those in Scotland hold a precisely similar view on this matter to those south of the Border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context it should be mentioned that the Scottish Landowners' Federation has raised with the Department of Agriculture the question of amending the 1949 Act so that rents could be reviewed every three years instead of every five years. This is dealt with under a new clause which I hope we shall debate in a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department's attitude has been to reply that such a change could only be made when a general review of the Act was undertaken. It is illogical and wrong, therefore, to introduce a major change dealing with a carefully devised machinery in respect of breaches in agricultural leases. The aim of the machinery provided for in the 1949 Act is to achieve a high standard of farming efficiency and estate management. The complicated provisions of Clauses 13 and 14 will make this aim extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. It seems to me that if I were to argue the detailed points that have been put up against these clauses, I would be repeating myself on the arguments I made previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall look forward to hearing, perhaps at the eleventh hour, a justification, a real argument in favour of this
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
philosophy. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, with his background and coming from where he does, will understand better the implications of his proposed legislation in Scotland. It is quite clear to me that he has not understood the implications of it in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has sought to suggest that the provisions of these clauses are generally unnecessary as there is no need for such changes in the law in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland that landlords in Scotland have not in general been guilty of the type of harassment of which complaint has been made elsewhere. It is also the case that incidents of this kind have occurred in Scotland. If he is in any doubt about this, he should have a word with my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan). As soon as it became clear that we were introducing a Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and that we were considering the introduction of measures to stop the harassment of tenants in the ways that we have discussed, my hon. Friend was quick to approach us to ensure that this would be applied to Scotland. He has had to deal with a most unfortunate case of this kind in his own constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was against this background that the Government concluded that since the law was being amended in England and Wales, it would be more satisfactory if the law in Scotland was brought broadly into line. The Committee will have noted that Clause 13 is longer than Clause 11 which contains parallel provisions for England and Wales. It has become clear in our discussions that the clause is longer because the law for England and Wales was amended in 1963 while the law applying to Scotland was not changed at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad purpose of the clause is to enable an arbiter to whom a case is referred under the General Scottish Arbitration Provisions—and where the arbitration relates to a question on a demand to remedy a breach of the tenancy relating to a notice to do work—to take certain action by extending the time available for doing the repair by deleting unnecessary items, specifying different methods or materials to give the tenant protection against being asked to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
do virtually unnecessary work, or to do it in an unnecessary manner or to have to do it within an unreasonably short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tory Members have rather over-stated their arguments in opposition to these clauses. I am now referring particularly to Clause 14, which parallels Clause 12 to which the hon. Members took exception. If landlords are not acting and do not wish to act unreasonably in relation to notices to tenants to do work on their holdings the landlords need have no concern regarding the effect of the clauses. In the last resort, what we are providing for in this clause it that a notice to quit following difficulties about repairs will not take effect if the Land Courts finds that a good and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession. I emphasise the word " possession". I therefore find it difficult to see why there should be objection to these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong if we did not have a word or two from a Scottish voice on the Back Benches about these clauses. The debates on these have been short because the principle involved is exactly the same as the principle involved in Clauses 11 and 12. We heard a good deal of rubbish from the Conservative side of the Committee about that and, thank Heaven, we in Scotland have been spared a further repetition of the same rubbish on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument was twofold. First, that it would distort good relations between landlord and tenant and, secondly, that the unnecessary extension of legal requirements would penalise the small farmer. The discussions on Clauses 11 and 12 expose the falsity of both arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the amendment that was moved to attempt to remove the qualification:
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless in all the circumstances it appears to them that a fair and reasonable landlord would not insist on possession".</p></blockquote>
In a sense this is the nub of the matter in relation to both of these clauses. What the clause is trying to do is to put, in a commonsense way, the job of the arbiter to try to create a fair relationship between the two and to prevent that aspect spilling into harassment. This occurs, in Scotland as it does in England and Wales. The cases are no doubt fewer and less
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
well known, partly because the population is smaller. But my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) has—not only recently but in the past—brought to me evidence of cases in the Highlands where this has occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the point concerning the word " squire". We have the same situation, particularly in the Highland areas, where we use the word " laird". It is this kind of relationship that we wish to prevent. It is the kind of relationship that Conservative Members always plead as being the merit of the countryside. We want to make this an arbitration process rather than merely a legalistic process by giving additional protection to tenants so that we do not have the kind of tensions that have existed. The legal requirements, far from penalising the small farmer on the question of cost, become the means whereby we can reach a satisfactory situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with my hon. Friend on one or two points. The argument for bringing this issue into the Bill is not merely that of bringing it in line with the English situation. These things are necessary because the landlord-tenant relationship is universal, whether north or south of the border. Secondly, it is because of the problem of getting legislative time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with the Opposition that it is an unsatisfactory method of legislating—this continual process of amendment upon amendment. But God help us! That is what we are blessed with in the British legislative structure. It is difficult to get the time and preparation. Even our method of consolidation of legislation does not always lend itself to this kind of thing. Consolidation, by definition, is a swift pulling together of legislation. It would be a pity if we could not adopt a method by which we could have a hybrid process whereby a consolidation measure could also contain elements of fresh legislation so that we would emerge—via consolidation measure—with a complete new set of proposals. This is something we should think about, but it cannot be solved only on an agricultural Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the fact that this is not a satisfactory method of doing things. It is " bitty ", and, as we have seen from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
our discussions on the Scottish clauses, it never really lets us get to the heart of the matter because so much material we would have liked to have put in would have overturned the balance of the Bill. The time factor in Clause 13(1)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) has brought in a new dimension which has been useful for the Scottish position. In the same way I support the extension of time at the requirements of the arbiter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the initial point. These clauses were necessary in England and Wales and they are necessary in Scotland. They do not, of themselves, upset landlord-tenant relationships. I believe that they do upset the landlord, but that is a different matter. He is bound by the general philosophy which these clauses bring in—that is, the practice of a good landlord not to behave in the way that a good landlord would not behave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has interested me throughout, whether on Clauses 11 and 12 or Clauses 13 and 14, is to note the keenness and avidity with which the Opposition have pursued the interests of the landlord, even in attempting to remove protective measures that were brought in to protect the tenant.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that where a balance is to be struck, it must be a fair one. It is striking a fair balance to protect the party which is less strong. The party which is less strong in such situations is the tenant farmer with less capital.—[Hon. Members: " Not always."]—I accept that there are many quite well-off tenant farmers, but in most of the situations we are discussing here, where a man is being pursued with remedy demands followed possibly by notice to quit, he is usually in the position of being the weaker party. These are the cases I am talking about. Cases of harassment do not worry a man who can cope with the problem. It is the man who cannot cope with the problem who requires protection. These clauses do that. I welcome them on behalf of Scotland, not as a parallel with English law but because they themselves are just.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 9, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>No. 122, in page 19, line 11, after insert " legally qualified".</p>
	<p>The clause is perhaps more important than a casual glance may suggest, because it imports a new principle. The clause amends Section 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970 and gives the Minister the power to recover a grant that has been paid, if the Minister himself considers that the applicant for that grant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
has given false or misleading information.</p>
	<p>I find the distinction between " false " and " misleading " somewhat disturbing. We are not talking about fraud in the clause. I make it plain that I am not suggesting any easy life for those who are guilty of fraud upon the Minister. If the information is false, the Minister has a remedy in the proper place, namely, in a criminal court, for the offence of obtaining money by false pretences. Therefore, what we are concerned about this morning is the ground of obtaining a grant by means of providing misleading information. The question is: misleading to whom? It is misleading to the Minister. The importance of the phrase is that the test is subjective and not objective. The test must be subjective and must relate to the mind of the Minister, whereas if the information is false the test is objective, meaning that the facts can he ascertained and proved in a court of law. It follows that if the facts given to the Minister are considered by him to have misled him, he can go ahead and recover the money.</p>
	<p>This is a serious matter, and my first question to the Minister is: is there a precedent? The nearest reference I can find are the penalty provisions set out in the Income Tax Act 1952, but I do not think that anyone could seriously argue that there is any true analogy between failing to provide proper information to the tax collector and providing information to the Minister which he himself may consider to be misleading. Therefore, I propose this amendment in the hope that the Minister will allow a legally qualified person to be appointed to decide whether the grant should be returned to the Minister, or whether it might be retained by the applicant. I believe it would be quite wrong for somebody who is not legally qualified and who cannot understand the difference between a subjective and an objective test to decide a matter as grave as this.</p>
	<p>I am not exaggerating when I say that the rule of law itself is infringed by this provision. We sometimes talk rather glibly about the rule of law as if it means obedience to the law as it has been provided by this House. That indeed is not the true rule of law in my submission. The rule of law has one essential principle, and that is that at the time when a person embarks upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
a course of action, or acts in any way, he should know at that moment whether his action is going to be within or without the law. That is at the heart of the rule of law, and I regret to say that this position is in breach of that principle for which we have fought dearly in this House for a very long time.</p>
	<p>I therefore hope that the Minister will give an assurance that there are reasonable precedents for this and, above all, that he will agree that there should be a legally qualified person to decide whether the Minister should have this money or not.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be helpful first for the Committee to realise the necessity for the change that is proposed in this clause. The clause seeks to give Ministers the power to recover the whole of any farm capital grant which has been the subject of a false claim. It seeks to do so by amending Section 29(4) of the Agriculture Act 1970 under which farm capital grants were paid. The power is needed because without it the Minister would only have the right to seek recovery of the excess over the amount properly due, and a person making a false claim could thus end up with as much grant as if the claim had been truthful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's point concerns the legal proof as to whether a statement is false or misleading. The grant schemes concerned in this clause are the Farm Capital Grant Schemes 1970 and 1973 and the Horticulture Capital Grants Scheme, and the use of the power which we seek in this clause will be confined to those cases where there has been a successful prosecution for fraud or for false statement. That is an assurance which the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) can take with some confidence. The Agriculture Departments take the view that only in such cases can the culpable falseness of the claim be regarded as being established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also remind the hon. Gentleman that there is a precedent for the situation in the Farm and Horticultural Developments Regulations 1973, which cater for a similar provision in Regulation 14(c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
