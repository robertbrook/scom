<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our last sitting I was interrupted in mid-flow, so if my oratory at the beginning is not quite up to its normal standard, I trust that you will forgive me, Mr. Costain.<br><br>
The Minister in moving the Government amendment asked us to trust his good judgment and accept his assurances. He has stated that these Government amendments are necessary to ensure that there is not a total widespread destruction of wild life, but that in an area where disease might be found the destruction in those localities will be restricted to a fairly narrow area.<br><br>
I hope that it is in order for me at this stage to say that we accept the Government's assurances. We believe that the Government are trying to make this a better Bill. I want to indicate to the Government that we, in turn, have
264571
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
tabled amendments—which will be debated a little later on—with exactly the same intention, namely, to improve the Bill, to ensure that the interests of all those who are concerned about wild life—those who own land and those who have sporting rights—areproperly safeguarded in this important piece of legislation.<br><br>
There is little that I can add to the Minister's remarks about the Government amendments. At the end of our last sitting I said that the debates in both Houses on badger gassing were the most recent discussions on the matters contained in Clauses 9 and 10. As many of us know, it was discovered that some badgers in a small area in the South West of this country were infecting cattle with bovine tuberculosis. We are delighted that measures have been taken to exterminate badgers from the control areas. Inevitably in the debates that will take place on both this clause and the next one we do not want to restrict Ministry officials and those acting on the Minister's instructions from exterminating as quickly as possible any animal that is infected and likely to pass that infection on to any other animal.<br><br>
With those brief, rather general, remarks, we accept the Government's assurances on these amendments. No doubt some of my hon. Friends will wish to make brief contributions.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 83, in page 10, line 4, leave out second "the".—[<i>Mr. Strang.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 34, in page 10, line 7, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"and any other relevant body".</p></blockquote>
Obviously at this stage of the morning my hon. Friends are, rather sadly, silent, because these are important clauses. Perhaps I should also direct my remarks to Labour members of the Committee. In particular I am sure that the attractive hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) will intervene later on.<br><br>
I hope that after I have developed a brief and cogent argument in support of this amendment the Government will accept the views advanced by this side of the Committee. I am sorry that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food cannot be with us this morning. However, I have here a letter dated 5th
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0252">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
December to the Minister from the personal assistant to the Director of The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds at Sandy in Bedfordshire. That society is rather concerned about this clause. Because, unfortunately a subsequent amendment which I tabled has not been selected for debate, I felt that it was important, in view of the matters we are debating this morning, that as many responsible, constructive and relevant bodies as possible should be consulted about the extermination of animals.<br><br>
I should like to quote a short paragraph from the letter. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under Clause 9 (3) we are concerned that 'consult' might be somewhat ambiguous."</p></blockquote>
The letter continues, and I thoroughly endorse this view, that although the Society appreciates that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food:
<br><blockquote><p>"will wish to retain a certain speed of reaction"</p></blockquote>
—I emphasise that that is absolutely vital—
<br><blockquote><p>"we would consider it reasonable (in order to safeguard conservation interests) for a supplementary clause to be inserted at the end, worded:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>… and shall, within one year of an Order being made, obtain the agreement of the Nature Conservancy Council."</p></blockquote>
That relates to the continuation of the Order. At that time negotiations would make it quite clear and the Nature Conservancy Council:
<br><blockquote><p>"shall state publically the scientific grounds for continuing with the Order and the conservation implications of so doing."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister, who I understand may have to leave us a little later this morning to deal with an important constituency matter, will take on board the vital necessity of conservation interests.<br><br>
Amendment No. 34 tries to draw to the Government's attention, and requests them to take on board, the vital work which is undertaken by conservation societies and, to put it rather more strongly, presses the need for positive consultation to take place with them.<br><br>
I have mentioned The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and have indicated that the Minister received a letter in December from that Society expressing deep concern about the Bill as it is at present drafted. However,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
there are many other conservation societies. I am well aware that the National Farmers' Union, which inevitably is deeply involved in this matter, wants the Ministry to retain the ability to act speedily. Conservative Members of the Committee also want the Ministry to retain the ability to act speedily in the eradication of disease which can cause so much havoc among cattle and other animals.<br><br>
However, at the same time it would be remiss of us not to appreciate that there are other conservation interests involved and that unless we are very careful, those interests can be totally submerged and completely overwhelmed and, who knows, at some time in the future, should there be a serious outbreak species of animal disease in this country, could be totally wiped off the face of the earth.<br><br>
It is for that reason that we have tabled this amendment. We do not wish in any way to frustrate the Government or the Ministry in the efficient and effective eradication of disease. We wish to ensure that, where areas are designated, where disease has broken out or where disease is suspected to have broken out, the relevant conservation bodies, in addition to the Nature Conservancy Council, will be consulted. I am delighted that the Nature Conservancy Council features so prominently in the Bill. It does a wonderful job and inevitably is an important society. However, I think the Minister will agree that there are other important conservation bodies apart from the Nature Conservancy Council. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will agree that this very constructive, short but none the less essential amendment should be written into the Bill to ensure that certain animal species in this country have the proper bodies to represent their interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tend to agree with the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). He made a good plea on behalf of other organisations. He mentioned the National Farmers' Union. What other bodies should be consulted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South—West (Mr. Hawkins) will take a part in this debate. I presume that we could mention the Wild Fowl Trust, an extremely well-known trust and society which is doing wonderful work in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0253">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
South West in particular but which can bring its influence to bear throughout the country. In addition, there is the Country Landowners' Association. Perhaps the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) is better able than I am to name other conservation societies that ensure that certain species of animals are safeguarded in this country.<br><br>
I repeat that the National Farmers' Union has made some observations on some of the amendments that have been tabled. That body is happy with this amendment, although obviously it is concerned to ensure that consultations do not become too wide or long—winded among conservation societies, because this might well delay vital disease control action by the Ministry.<br><br>
Conservative Members of the Committee fully support that point of view but believe that the consultations should be slightly wider than they are at present under the Bill, which we seek to amend. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will consider that the simple words
<br><blockquote><p>"and any other relevant body"</p></blockquote>
are acceptable. To some extent the Ministry will have the decision within its own walls. It will be able to make a decision as to what " any other relevant body " may be.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. It is an important one. A number of conservation interests which have written to us believe that these words would make the Bill more positive and safeguard the interests of certain species of animal within the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise for only a few moments to assure my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) that, far from being asleep, as I think he thought we on the back benches were, we were only struck dumb by his oratory.<br><br>
I, too, want to stress the interests of other bodies. In my part of the world there are two major conservation bodies. My hon. Friend has mentioned the Wild Fowl Trust which has one of the most importance reserves at Welney, which is right on the extreme west of my constituency. It is one of the most interesting developments that has ever happened in this strange area between two major waterways—an area of land which is flooded in order to relieve the drainage of the Fens in the winter.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
I am referring to wildfowl and also to the wading birds found in the area owing to the gradual spread of water and the virutal tide-line on internal waters equivalent to the sea line elsewhere.<br><br>
In my constituency I have probably the most energetic naturalist trust, the Norfolk Naturalist Trust, which has many reserves and preserves both on the coast and inland throughout Norfolk. The Trust undertakes a magnificent job of work. Indeed, the Nature Conservancy Council is hardly known in my part of the world, in contrast to the well known activities of the Norfolk Naturalist Trust. The grass roots of the trust are provided by the existence in many places of resident wardens who provide a great deal of information about the area.<br><br>
I do not come from the West, and I have been horrified about the gassing of badgers. It may be necessary, but I hope the Minister will make clear that the activity is closely circumscribed and controlled by Ministry officials. I hope that he will make the situation clear to those outside the area because, unfortunately, many of the sets in Norfolk have been destroyed. I know of one large woodland area where many—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I draw the hon. Member's attention to the fact that we are talking about other bodies, not the animals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mr. Costain, that you will allow me to make the point that it should be clear that the provision does not extend to the destruction of this lovely animal by other people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the well—researched remarks of hon. Gentlemen who have taken part in this debate, I cannot advise the Committee to accept the Amendment.<br><br>
Before giving my reasons, I should first explain why the subsection requires the appropriate Minister to consult the Nature Conservancy Council. That Council is already charged with the specific statutory responsibility of advising the Government on matters relating to wildlife and it is right and proper that it should be fully consulted before such an Order is made. I am sure that that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0254">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
body and the appropriate Minister would, if necessary, also consult any other body known to be knowledgeable about the wildlife species involved.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) said, the Norfolk Naturalist Trust would be one of the bodies to be consulted, if that were felt to be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure the Committee that the responsibility of the Nature Conservancy Council correlates with the diseases scheduled in Section 1 of the 1950 Act?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a new obligation that is being put on the Government. It is a follow-through from the specific legislative provision made to enable us to gas badgers in the South West.<br><br>
I appreciate your ruling, Mr. Costain, that we should not be drawn on that subject, but I merely point out that there has been a great deal of debate on that matter in both Houses of Parliament. The animal welfare lobby, almost without exception, has been satisfied about the Government's intentions and believes that the work is necessary and will be carried out sensibly and in a restrictive way.<br><br>
It would be wrong to place on the Minister a formal requirement to consult other appropriate bodies. It would be impracticable for the Minister to be expected to consult a number of bodies when, for example, a minor adjustment needed to be made.<br><br>
The Minister should be left to decide, in the light of the problem that arises, whether wider consultation is necessary and, if so, which bodies he will consult. In any case, a statutory obligation to consult a "relevant body" would be almost meaningless, because it would be open to interpretation as to whether a particular body were relevant.<br><br>
No doubt hon. Gentlemen are using this amendment as a means of obtaining a Government assurance that we will consult other appropriate bodies when that is justified by circumstances. However, I believe that it would be a mistake for the Opposition to press the amendment, and I hope that it will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are disappointed with the Minister's reply. He rightly referred to the animal welfare
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
organisations and the objectives of the conservancy bodies, whose views we all share. But although I do not underestimate the Minister's good intentions, I do not believe he has given any good reason why the Amendment should not be included in the Bill.<br><br>
He said that the words to be inserted would be open to all sorts of interpretations and, indeed, he said that they would be meaningless. I do not agree. The wording of the amendment means exactly what it says. In the destruction of wildlife involving the making of an Order, we are suggesting that the organisations concerned should be consulted as a statutory requirement. The Minister admitted that he will be consulting organisations which he feels should be consulted. Therefore, what objection has he to writing such a responsibility into the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter which would then be subject to interpretation in the courts. A financial or sporting interest may take us to court for not having consulted it on these matters. I am sure the hon. Gentleman does not intend that to happen. Surely he would not like us to be placed in that position because of the wording of an Act of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I certainly would not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very concerned about this point. The phrase " any other relevant body" may lead to a number of bodies going before the court to declare an order to be <i>ultra vires</i>because of loose wording. I accept the spirit of my hon. Friend's Amendment but I am disturbed about the looseness of the wording.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend to be infalliable in drawing up the amendment, but I am sure that my hon. Friend is fully conversant with its spirit and intention. I felt that it was unnecessary to specify the relevant organisations to be consulted statutorily by the Minister. However, I still feel that the Minister's assurance is not as foolproof or as comprehensive as it might be. Perhaps I might be permitted to point out that subsection (5) deals with extermination methods and includes the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"that would otherwise be unlawful"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that is a point
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
for the "Clause stand part" debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will allow me, Mr. Costain, to deal with the matter for half a minute. Surely where methods of extermination which otherwise might be considered unlawful are to be used, organisations concerned over welfare and conservation of wildlife and wildlife species in general should be consulted. This surely applies whether they are bodies representing veterinary officers, the RSPCA, the Nature Conservancy Council or some of the other organisations I have already mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government have got back on an even keel. The purpose of these amendments is quite clear. I regret the outcome of the Division on our important Amendment No.34. I hope that we shall have a little more sympathy from the Minister and his colleagues of these amendments.<br><br>
The general view of Clauses 9 and 10 seems to be that measures to deal with infected wild creatures, especially badgers—my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South—west (Mr. Hawkins), has referred to his abhorrence of the gassing of these delightful animals—areneeded so that there should not be too much red tape—I hate that phrase—attachedto the procedures to hamper Ministry officials as long as proper consideration and consultation is given to owners or occupiers of land on which disease has broken out or is suspected.<br><br>
It is our view, backed by legal advice, that the Bill's provisions are ill—thoughtout. Its purposes do not warrant the almost unrestricted powers of entry granted in the Bill. Safeguards are needed. It is essential that the Ministry should consult owners and occupiers about what it proposes to do and when it proposes to do it. Occupiers should be given at least 48 hours' notice of entry on to their land. I do not think there could be any such dire emergency that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
would require entry without notice or consultation.<br><br>
One could easily use the much hackneyed phrase that an Englishman's home is his castle. I believe that and the landowner's land is his castle, too. If people want to come on to it to exterminate animals, he should be given notice.<br><br>
Some hon. Members opposite may not agree, but I believe that the holders of sporting rights should also be consulted. The Ministry's operations might well interfere with the exercise of sporting rights, and a diseased species could be game. The Under—Secretary may not agree with this type of sport or approve of those who indulge in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Buckingham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will remember the fowl pest outbreak about five years ago. This had a tremendous effect because game birds were infected with the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under—Secretary will comment on that very important point when he replies to this debate.<br><br>
The Ministry has power to erect fences and place obstacles on land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not dig holes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that Ministry officials are not allowed to dig holes. At any rate, it is most important that occupiers should be consulted. It is conceivable that means of access to farms might be fenced off by officials entering land to exterminate animals. Livestock could also be affected. They may be grazing on the land and have their water supply fenced off. Stockproof fencing might have to be provided to safeguard animals from any dangerous operations being carried out by the Ministry. All these matters need consideration and that is the purpose of our amendments. Owners, occupiers and the holders of sporting rights should be consulted and given at least 48 hours' notice of the Ministry's intention to enter on to land.<br><br>
This is not unreasonable. If the Minister owned land—I do not know whether he does—he would expect notice of people coming on to it. Even where there are animal diseases, I do not believe the emergency will be so dire as to prevent notice being given so that the person concerned may say "Yes" or "No". He may have to move livestock from the area. The actions of Ministry officials might have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
a detrimental effect on the running of the farm. This is a reasonable amendment. The Ministry will obviously wish to avoid being placed under a total commitment to the occupier, but it should inform owners and occupiers and this amendment stresses the importance of informing all those who are likely to have cattle, sheep or other animals grazing on the land concerned. The Bill provides that the Ministry should inform:
<br><blockquote><p>"any other person who may be there"</p></blockquote>
and this should be sufficient to cater for those who graze cattle on common land. No doubt some of my hon. Friends will refer to common land and the many problems that can arise when animals are exterminated there. There can be difficulties in locating and identifying those with rights to the land.<br><br>
If the Ministry is to be allowed to use methods of destroying wildlife which would otherwise be unlawful there is a possibility of its using poisons which could endanger the health and even the lives of cattle and sheep grazing in the area. The Bill does not cater for that eventuality. I am sure the Ministry would not wish to be responsible for the death of animals.<br><br>
The powers under subsection (8)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill allow the Ministry to prevent the movement of cattle and sheep on common land, which would naturally affect the exercise of grazing rights. We are not arguing over the principle of the clause, but it is vital to ensure that people's interests are properly safeguarded. At present they are not adequately catered for.<br><br>
I will reserve any other remarks for later in the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield, (Mr. Winter—ton), and will take issue with him on only one point. He referred to an owner being able to say "Yes" or "No". I do not believe that, in these dangerous circumstances, an owner has the right to say "No". As was shown very clearly in the rabies outbreak around Aldershot and in the recent foot and mouth and fowl pest outbreaks, the co—operation of owners was essential. Strangely enough, owners know their land better than most people and, in the difficult operation of exterminating wild species—and I shall be interested to hear what the RSPCA has to say about the proposed methods—it is essential to have their co—operation, otherwise things will be very difficult.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
In the three instances to which I have referred, co—operation was given at once and everything went very smoothly. If there is friction and owners find people tramping over their land trying to get rid of species of wildlife, they will be angry and upset. The Government have everything to gain by accepting the tenor of these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). He deviated slightly, though not irrelevantly by referring to the poisoning of wildlife. We may more advantageously come to that in discussing the obligations of the Ministry to reinstate land. That will lead to all sorts of spin—offs which we shall have to discuss in detail later. However that may be, I support my hon. Friend in the generality.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The theme running throughout the amendments is one of good will and cooperation. They are written in terms of the parties that have specific rights in the situation. That includes the owner or someone with a schooting or sporting right. There are, however, general rights under ancient law. I do not intend to enter into a long discussion on common land, but I mention in passing the existence of bridleways and footpaths which could well be affected by perfectly legitimate operations under the clause.<br><br>
What is omitted from the clause, unless it be comprehended by the Diseases of Animals Act 1950, is public notification. That would embrace the two sectors, those with specific rights in the matter and those with general rights, even if they are merely hikers who are following the county council's footpath map on a Sunday afternoon. Imagine the frustration of hikers who, having taken a bus 25 miles out of Sheffield or Scunthorpe, alight only to encounter a fence erected by the Minister. The question of notification must be pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support my hon. Friend's amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) said, this is a question of gaining confidence. That is the great secret in the countryside, and I feel sure that the Under—Secretary understands that, even if the Scottish countryside is different from that in Norfolk. Strangers often suddenly appear on one's land and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
one's hackles rise. There is, quite frankly, today such an invasion of people on to land from various bodies which have rights to go on the land—the electricity and gas boards, the road authorities, and so on—that, unless notice is given, there could be trouble. That would not help the Ministry to carry out its tasks under the clause.<br><br>
I am not sure whether my next point is covered by the Bill, but I am concerned about the question of damage and compensation for it. The Bill refers to different methods of destruction. These could include poison or gin traps and they could injure animals belonging to the farmer. The farmer's dogs could be injured. What would be done then about compensation? I have known a case where damage costing several hundred pounds was caused by inspectors from the electricityboard. They did not ask the farmer before going over his land. They walked straight through a potato crop and spread blight from one end of the field to the other. In the end the board had to pay compensation to the owner. Will compensation be paid in similar circumstances under the Bill?<br><br>
Of course, such damage will be kept to a minimum so long as notice is given. Forty—eight hours is the minimum to enable farmers to take the necessary steps perhaps to move cattle off certain fields or re—position a flock of sheep. That is not an unreasonable request.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was the tenant of sporting rights on the farm I rented, which is located two parishes away from the scene of the great foot and mouth outbreak in about 1963. At that time the whole of that part of Worcestershire was brought to a halt by this plague. It was one of the more frightening experiences of my life. The whole countryside came to an eerie halt. All business and social engagements were stopped and for nearly two months we lived in a totally different world. Those of us who possessed sporting rights did everything we could to co—operate with the Ministry and with our neighbours in their difficulties.<br><br>
This leads me to raise two points. The first concerns sporting rights. The Minister has said that there would be difficulties, when faced with the hectic problem of eliminating a species on private property, in learning who has the sporting rights. The answer is very simple. They are now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
assessed for rating purposes at a fairly high level. The ownership is easily available from the rating authority.<br><br>
I do not quarrel with the suggested period of 48 or 24 hours' notice. The important thing is the principle, which is that the owner of the sporting rights should have some notice. I cannot conceive of a situation where, in the event of a national emergency, the vast majority of private individuals would not allow the Ministry access at once if it appeared to be in the interests of the neighbourhood. There are cases where some notice is desirable and it is therefore only reasonable for the Minister to give way on this point. I wholeheartedly support the philosophy of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must remind hon. Members that subsection (7) concerns the personal safety of people on the land, and its aim is to ensure that, when it is proposed to destroy wild life, reasonable steps are taken to make certain that people on the spot—that is, the occupier and any other person there—are informed so that they will be aware of what is to happen and of the methods to be used. They can then make any special arrangements they consider necessary, such as arranging for livestock to be moved or for pet animals to be locked up. They can also draw attention to any special considerations relevant to the proposed operation. Notification to these people is therefore a prudent step that the Minister can reasonably be expected to take. Sub—section (7) is not concerned with commercial or proprietary rights on matters affecting the daily lives of people on the land.<br><br>
There may be instances where we will want to get on to land very quickly and where we have to be very careful about writing in a requirement that 48 hours' notice should be given, particularly to individuals or groups whom we might have some difficulty in locating. This legislation does not of course apply to rabies, but it covers such diseases as foot and mouth disease, if that were being transmitted by wild life such as deer, and foulpest. We are therefore talking not only about tuberculosis or brucellosis, serious as those diseases are. We are here concerned with the possibility of very serious epidemics.<br><br>
In those circumstances, it would be wrong to put an absolute duty on the Minister to notify the owner and occupier
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
of the land and the owner of the sporting rights, irrespective of the difficulties which might be encountered in attempting to do so.<br><br>
The amendment has not taken account of the difficulty which might be encountered in discovering the whereabouts of these people. The success of an operation to prevent the spread of disease by destroying wild life could therefore be put in jeopardy if these people could not be contacted within a reasonable time. Every reasonable effort will be made to identify the occupier and any other person on the land, but, if this cannot be done for reasons beyond the control of the Minister, it is essential that he should still be able to take whatever action he considers necessary to eliminate the disease problem. This must remain the overriding consideration.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) moved his first amendment to the Bill he said that he wanted the Ministry to retain its right to act speedily. He was kind enough to remind us that the NFU agreed with the Government on that. It is therefore essential that the Ministry must be in a position to take whatever action it considers necessary to eliminate a disease problem. It would be ridiculous if a serious disease which was endangering wildlife, farm livestock and perhaps even human beings, could not be investigated immediately without the need to contact the people referred to in the amendment and to wait at least 48 hours before entering the land.<br><br>
I agree with almost everything that hon. Members have said, that it would be nonsense for Ministry officers to walk on to land without holding adequate consultation. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South—West (Mr. Hawkins) referred to the need of the gas and electricity boards to go on to land. That is a fact of modern life. Surely he is not suggesting that these boardsand other organisations do not normally give a tenant or occupier advance notice.<br><br>
One hon. Member wondered whether perhaps I owned land. I do. My house is on a piece of land which I own and I have a small garden. I would be perfectly happy to give an officer of the Ministry the right in an emergency to go into my garden without notice urgently to kill a hedgehog which might be carrying foot and mouth disease. That would be my duty and my responsibility as a citizen.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
We are prepared to look again at the question of writing in a period of time, but we cannot accept the amendment. I do not want to be over optimistic or build up hon. Members' hopes, but we will consider the matter, because we must be given flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am more concerned about the general knowledge of the situation. The duty to inform is restricted to the owner or the person on the land. But there are others involved. For example I have had a running fight with my local education authority about distances from school and the right of children to use school buses. The distance is usually measured in terms of footpaths from the farm or the individual's home. If these are suddenly blocked, and representations have to be made to the local education authority, on what basis can they be made? It is only reasonable that the Minister should take on board some duty of public notification, irrespective of the present immediate issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should say something about compensation and about the type of disease involved. He referred to foot—and—mouth disease, and I think I know as much about the horrors of that disease as anyone. I have seen animals slaughtered and burnt and the desolation on the farms. Of course, we all co—operate fully. Every member of the public, every farmer and every farm worker co—operates.<br><br>
I cannot understand whey there should be any question of acting without notice, because in these cases an Order would already have been laid in regard to the area, and within that area Ministry inspectors have a right to enter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both hon. Members have made similar points. An Order will be laid. That is the point. An area will be designated by Order, and that Order will be published in the London Gazette. As a Scotsman I am aware that the London Gazette is read by a small sample of the population, but the Order will also be printed in the local Press. We must remember that the exercise of investigating and destroying wild life will only follow the laying of an Order in Parliament just as in the specialised case of badgers when an area was designated. In this case an area will be designated where these rights will be exercised. That is the background
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
procedure against which all these procedures will take place. I hope that hon. Members will now feel more reassured.<br><br>
On the question of compensation, the Ministry will be liable at common law for damage caused by negligence. There is an amendment specifically on this topic, and it would not be appropriate for me to be drawn into a general discussion on compensation at this stage. We must be prepared for the extreme situation. It may be unlikely, but we must have powers should such an unfortunate development occur. I hope that in these circumstances the hon. Member will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am relatively reassured by the assurance given by the Minister, but there are one or two other matters which should be raised.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) was right when he said that the most successful way of dealing with matters relating to land is by co—operation. The theme of all the amendments is that reason should prevail. The word reasonable forms part of the amendments—"take all reasonable steps to"; and "after safe ' insert reasonable '" are some examples. We are trying to ensure that those who know the land best—those who use it, work on it and farm it—are the people who are involved early on and all the way through these unpleasant occasions to ensure that the job is done correctly.<br><br>
There are a couple of other matters which should be dealt with. I refer specifically to Clause9(7). In our view, this does not go far enough by simply requiring that reasonable steps be taken to inform the occupier of the land. It requires the destruction to be carried out in a safe manner. Surely that is an insufficient criterion. The authority should also be required to act reasonably and so as to cause the least possible interference with land use.<br><br>
I return to the letter sent to the Minister of Agriculture by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, of Sandy, Bedfordshire. Referring to Clause 9(7) and to Clause 10, the society says that it feels
<br><blockquote><p>"that it is necessary on conservation grounds to ensure that incidental damage is not done to rare and endangered species under these sections".</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South West (Mr. Hawkins) was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
right to refer to the excellent work under taken by the Slimbich Trust.<br><br>
It is, therefore, the view of the Opposition that any Order relating in whole or in part to a nature reserve should have the prior approval of the Nature Conservancy Council, which should have the right to control any subsequent operation if it so wishes. I am sure the Minister will agree that this is a sensible point and that such safeguards should be written into the Bill.<br><br>
Clause 9(9) is too vague. No one really knows what is meant by " as soon as may be". The Minister on an earlier amendment said that our words could mean anything and, in fact, were meaningless. He should say what " as soon as may be means. As the authority can put fences and obstacles on the land, it might be important to the occupier that they be removed as soon as they are no longer necessary, especially as there is no compensation clause either in this Bill or in the Diseases of Animals Act 1950. Can the Minister make some comment about that? I appreciate that there is a later amendment which endeavours to draw compensation into the Bill, but surely it would not be out of order for the matter to have some airing at this stage.<br><br>
I hope the Minister has taken on board the intention of our amendments. I will not advise my hon. Friends to divide on the amendment, because of the Minister's assurances that further consideration will be given between now and Report to trying to improve the drafting of the Bill. We accept the Minister's reassurances, but I hope that the Minister will reply to the two or three matters which I have raised in my summing up, before we conclude this stage of our deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must remind hon. Members that compensation is not part of this debate. We have drifted into it and we must not get involved in it now.<br><br>
If the Minister does not wish to reply, does the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) wish to withdraw the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am unwilling to withdraw the amendment at this stage. Perhaps the Minister can comment briefly on some of my points and then I would be happy to withdraw. But I should be unhappy to do so if he is not prepared to answer.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not be appropriate to discuss compensation now and you, Mr. Costain, support me on that. The hon. Gentleman has tended to concentrate on issues that we have already discussed. I agree with him in his reference to the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon). Of course we will want to consult with the people involved. It is in the interests of the Ministry and it is likely to do a better job if it seeks to co—operate with all those who havean interest in the land, whether it be the owner or the person who exercises the sporting rights.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that officers of the Ministry will take very seriously the comments made by hon. Members. They will make every effort to ensure that people are given proper notice and they will seek to co—operate with them on these matters. Hon. Members must recognise that we are talking about serious diseases. The vast bulk of farmers will be only too happy to co—operate and facilitate any action taken by the officers of the Ministry. However, we are prepared to look again at this question of writing in the time limit. We have agreed to come back to it, and I cannot be expected to go further than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister make a brief reference to the rare and endangered species that could be affected by an Order and subsequent action carried out under it? Could he also comment on the views I expressed about the Nature Conservancy Council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a specific amendment to be discussed later concerning the Nature Conservancy Council and wild life sanctuaries, where one would expect species of this kind to be harboured. It goes without saying that the Ministry will take into account the question of endangered species. But I must remind hon. Members that we are talking about an emergency situation and at that time a decision will have to be taken about whether some special efforts should be made to protect a particular species.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
Very elaborate steps have been taken in relation to the badger population in the South—West and this is one reason that the animal welfare lobby, if I can describe it thus, has been satisfied with the Government's action. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are seized of the importance of this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
point. It is a subject in which I am interested personally. I was a geneticist and am interested in this from the point of view of not losing genes which exist in the animal population in this country. I am all for the maintenance of species which are in danger of extinction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that we have had this information so far in the debate. However, it would be interesting to hear from the Minister the actual range of diseases that are covered by the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are talking about the amendment, not the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister draws his remarks on this amendment to a close, and bearingin mind the views which he has expressed, perhaps he will indicate the range of diseases which he believes it appropriate to mention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in danger of stretching the good humour of the Committee, ifnot that of its Chairman, a little too far. Basically, we are talking about any disease other than rabies which can be transmitted by an animal or bird. We cannot foresee these things. We do not know what diseases might be brought into this country and, therefore, we are taking powers to enable us to act in unforeseen circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 38, in page 10, line 42, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"The appropriate authority may employ local pest and vermin control organisations to carry out this duty".</p></blockquote>
I shall not detain the Committee long on this amendment. I hope that we shall have the total agreement of the Minister. I sometimes wonder whether there is something wrong with me, because all the amendments about which I am talking on behalf of Her Majestry's Opposition in Committee seem to receive rough treatment at the Minister's hands. When my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) moved various amendments he had the almost total sympathy of the Minister. I had hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary was rather a different kettle of fish from the Minister of State,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
but where I am concerned it seems that they both take the rather hard and intolerant attitude that everything I put forward cannot be truly correct. I am endeavouring to represent important interests in agriculture. I have a feeling that I may, with luck, have the Minister's support. He has not nodded, smiled or in any way indicated his view, but I hope that I shall receivea sympathetic hearing.<br><br>
This amendment would be a useful addition, because it would strengthen the authority of pest and vermin control organisations with farmers. As we are all aware, the pest control societies have been urging the Government for a long time to introduce a Bill under which compulsory membership of the societies by farmers should be introduced on a regional basis. My hon. Friend, the Member for Norfolk, South—West (Mr. Hawkins) will, I hope, intervene in this debate, as he has certainly expressed an interest in it. That followed a vote among the farming community in favour of compulsion being introduced. I have been informed by the National Farmers' Union that that suggestion has not been favourably accepted by the Government to date. Surely the Government can understand that there is some purpose in it and that nothing but improvement could take place by writing these words into the Bill.<br><br>
I hope, with that brief introduction, that the Minister will respond slightly more favourably in my direction than he has in recent minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me assure the hon. Gentleman that I always give him a sympathetic hearing. If it will help him to sleep better at night, I make it absolutely clear that I am not in any way more favourably disposed towards his hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He wants some potatoes!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, together with my hon. Friend the Minister of State and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, when he is present, treat every amendment on its merits, quite regardless of which Conservative Member has endeavoured to move it, although to some extent the tenor of one's remarks is influenced by the way in which hon. Gentlemen move amendments.<br><br>
The appropriate authority can always
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
employ outside agents to do work for it, and Clause 10(1)(c) already makes provision for a person other than an official to exercise all the powers that will be necessary under Clause 9. This provision will, therefore, make it possible for a specialist pest or vermin control organisation to be employed.<br><br>
I visualise that, as far as possible, specialist officials employed by the Ministers concerned will always be used and that an outside organisation will be employed only should operations be on a large scale or when it is able to supply special expertise or scarce equipment.<br><br>
The public generally and, in particular, the conservation organisations, some of which hold very strong views, will be comforted to know that operations involving destruction of wildlife will normally be carried out by official experts.<br><br>
I mention in passing that one of the matters which was repeatedly raised in relation to the badger issue was that of the animal welfare interests' desire that it should be Ministry officers who carry out the job and not outsiders. Although I understand the hon. Gentleman's feelings the adoption of this amendment could give some of those people grounds for fearing that it is intended to employ outside organisations on a much greater scale than we have in mind. I hope that I have explained to the hon. Gentleman why the amendment is unnecessary and why it would be prudent for him to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear the Minister say that all these outside bodies can be employed. Although the welfare animal organisations may feel more comforted by the fact that a Ministry official will carry out the actual destruction, I should have thought that people such as gamekeepers, and even poachers, could despatch an animal more quickly than I, who have lived in the countryside all my life, or certain officers of the Ministry who have not had the experience. It is, of course, the experience which the Minister emphasises and which is so necessary in carrying out the deed as humanely and quickly as possible.<br><br>
I do not want to cross swords with my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), who moved the amendment, but I am not in favour of compulsorily making all farmers in an area join in a pest control scheme. There is enough compulsion about life as it is. The

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
pests on one's own land are one's own responsibility to get rid of and, although co-operation across the boundaries is most important, an element of compulsion within the countryside is foreign to us and can only lead to ill will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of my hon. Friend, the Member for Norfolk, South West (Mr. Hawkins) are not totally unexpected. This is a probing amendment. It seeks to encourage the use of local expertise and, although my hon. Friend does not agree with compulsion and says that vermin on one's own land is one's own responsibility, I believe that vermin on one's land can well affect the land owned by a neighbouring farmer or landowner. Therefore, I do not fully endorse the views expressed by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
This is a probing amendment. I view the Minister's assurances favourably, and if it is the Committee's wish, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendments made:</i> No. 86, in page 11, line 1, leave out "the".</p>
<p>Number 87, in page 11, line 4, leave out "the".—[<i>Mr. Strang.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 88 in page 11, line 8, leave out "resurgence" and insert "reappearance".<br><br>
This amendment is one of simple clarity. The word "resurgence" has a fairly narrow technical meaning in veterinary circles, denoting the intensification of a diseased condition of an animal or animal population in which it has been dormant. The word "reappearance" has the advantage of having a somewhat wider meaning which would include, for example, the reinfection of an animal population with the disease by, say, survival of the disease organism in the ground. Needless to say, if there is an occasion when these powers we are seeking have to be used, it will be necessary to ensure that the disease has been completely eliminated by ensuring that steps are taken to prevent reappearance of the disease.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 109, in page 11, line 10, leave out from second "as" to second "any" in line 11.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to discuss Amendment No. 103, in page 11, line 11, leave out second "that" and insert "any".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To follow the Minister's example, I shall be brief. This is an important clause but the Government amendments which have just been agreed improve the Bill. That also applies to Amendment No. 109. This amendment will improve the effectiveness and the purpose of the Bill. It clarifies the position to all those who will be involved. Cooperation in the eradication of the disease is important, and we believe that these minor drafting alterations to the Bill will improve it. It is for that purpose that we have tabled these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman that these are simply minor drafting amendments. In just the same way as a decision to commence operations against wildlife on land is a matter entirely for the discretion of the appropriate Minister, so it is for him to decide when the operations should cease and if any measures have been taken restricting the use, and so on, of that land, whether the land can be reinstated.<br><br>
Sub—section (9) has been drafted in such a way that the Minister's discretion to decide when land can be reinstated is not impaired. This is in keeping with the fact that it is the Minister's ultimate responsibility to ensure that the problem of disease in wildlife is satisfactorily resolved. It would be wrong for his discretion to be put in doubt by these proposed amendments.<br><br>
The Minister will, of course, be keen to ensure that operations cease as soon as possible and that anything placed on the land in connection with work will be removed and the land reinstated as soon as it is safe to do so. This is standard practice when dealing with disease outbreaks of farm livestock. However, the decision must rest solely with him. If any person feels aggrieved over such a decision, it is possible for him to adopt various courses to ensure that his complaint is taken up without weakening the Minister's statutory freedom of action.<br><br>
In view of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Member will agree to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
brief in my introductory remarks because to some extent these matters were touched on earlier.<br><br>
I feel that at this stage the matter is not as important as the Minister said, although an important principle is involved overall. Because we were given an assurance earlier, I did not feel like going over the same ground. It will be my intention to seek to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
I wish only to emphasise the point that, where Ministry officials go on to a farmer's land to eradicate diseased animals and when those operations are complete, we should ensure that the land should be opened up again for animal husbandry as quickly as possible, with the removal of all fences and other impedimenta.<br><br>
I appreciate that the Minister has already given assurances on this matter. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 39, in Clause 9, page 11, line 16, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"; and in the event of any dispute arising hereunder this will be referred to an arbitrator to be selected by mutual consent between the appropriate authority and the occupier and such arbitrator is empowered to grant any amount by way of compensation or compensation adjustment provided that any reference to the arbitrator arises out of damage caused in execution of the duties permitted under subsection (2) above".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment, we may also take Amendment No. 104, in page 11, line 45, atend insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(14) The appropriate authority shall make full compensation to any person who has sustained loss or damage by reason of the exercise of powers under this section, and any dispute arising from a claim under this subsection shall be determined by an arbitrator appointed jointly by the authority and the claimant or in default of agreement by the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Arbitration Act 1950 shall apply to the arbitration".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come now to the important matter of compensation which was touched upon a few moments ago, but on that occasion the Minister declined to comment.<br><br>
This amendment involves one of the most important matters we shall discuss on Clause 9. The livelihood of a farmer, landowner or user of land could be adversely affected by the operations of Ministry officials in exterminating diseased animals. Neither in the present Bill nor in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
the Diseases of Animals Act 1950 is there any mention of compensation. If a person's livelihood is to be adversely affected, and if in the course of extermination and destruction of diseased wildlife Ministry officials damage property, it is only right that compensation should be paid to those affected.<br><br>
We hope that disputes will not arise, but my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyonis a practising farmer and is well aware that problems can arise following these operations. Effective operations can be carried out only if there is co—operation between the Ministry and those who are farming or using the land in question. We believe that if a dispute arises it should be referred to an arbitrator
<br><blockquote><p>"to be selected by mutual consent between the appropriate authority and the occupier …".</p></blockquote>
I believe that the Amendment will bring natural justice to the situation. We are not asking for anything unreasonable, nor are we seeking to inhibit the operations involved in the extermination of diseased animals. This matter concerns all who use or work on the land.<br><br>
Surely the Minister will accept unreservedly the fact that anybody whose land or property is damaged by the operations of Ministry officials in carrying out their duties should be entitled to compensation and that the amount should be decided by an independent arbitrator acceptable to both parties.<br><br>
Representations made to me on this subject reflect a wide range of views. Indeed views expressed by those who work on the land or who have anything to do with the land are almost unanimous on this point.<br><br>
I appreciate that we are all concerned about public expenditure, but if Parliament is to pass legislation affecting people's interests—property, fencing or whatever it may be—we should surely ensure that suitable compensation is paid in the event of a dispute. For example, when poison is used in the extermination of a diseased badger set, sheep or cattle may pick up the poison. When those animals have to be destroyed, or if they die as a result of picking up that poison, the livelihood of a farmer, landowner or tenant farmer could be put in jeopardy and serious financial loss may be incurred. If the Government wish to introduce legislation of this nature, it must contain elements of natural justice. If property is damaged or animals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
are lost, it is right and proper that compensation should be paid. All we are saying on this amendment is that in the event of a dispute involving a farmer, landowner, people with sporting rights or tenant farmers, the matter should be referred to an independent
<br><blockquote><p>"arbitrator to be selected by mutual consent between the appropriate authority and the Minister".</p></blockquote>
That arbitrator should have the right to decide the amount of compensation.<br><br>
I have examined the amendment from every angle and have tried to envisage what objection the Minister could have to it. I appreciate that he may say that there are objections from the point of view of public expenditure, but the extermination of diseased animals will in the long term save the country a considerable amount of money. Therefore, any sums awarded as compensation will probably eventually save the country hundreds of thousands of £s and that compensation will be money well spent.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will appreciate the intention behind the amendment and will advise his hon. Friends to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I started on the subject on the wrong amendment, and you, Mr. Costain, kindly drew my attention to it.<br><br>
I know that the Minister fully understands the situation and will be fair in his reply. He appreciates what happens when by mistake livestock is injured or is let out on to land, and also what happens when poison is carried elsewhere by sheepdogs. We appreciate that there are rights at common law, but we believe that the situation should be clearly covered.<br><br>
I prefer Amendment No. 104, because it relates to the situation as covered by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, in which I have an interest. Surely in the event of a dispute, the best possible person to be consulted is the President of that institution. I can instance one occasion when a group of people trailed through a crop of potatoes and caused blight which did a considerable amount of damage although originally the disease was confined to one corner of a field. Furthermore, there may be damage to pets belonging to owner—occupiers or workmen on farms resulting from the setting of gin traps or the laying down of poison. Therefore, if the Minister cannot deal with the matter on this occasion, I hope that he will be
264571
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
able to introduce a provision to cover the situation on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In connection with the first of these amendments I must point out that Clause 9(9)places very definite statutory obligations upon the appropriate Minister following the completion of operations against wildlife, to remove from the land anything placed or erected on it and to take all other steps as are reasonably practicable to reinstate the land.<br><br>
If the Minister fails to take any action when he should, or the action taken is considered to be inadequate or negligently carried out, then clearly the aggrieved party can use existing legal channels to secure redress. I consider it quite unnecessary for a further, somewhat vague, channel to be established for this purpose.<br><br>
Amendment No. 104 goes much wider by making all operations to resolve a wildlife disease problem subject to payment of compensation by the appropriate Minister. This introduces a new concept to diseases of animals legislation which I am unable to accept.<br><br>
The Agricultural Ministers in successive Governments have always thought it right and proper that compensation based upon market values should be paid whenever farm livestock are slaughtered compulsorily in the course of disease eradication operations. Appropriate statutory provision exists for such payments. Successive Governments have, however, always been firmly opposed to the question of compensation for other losses resulting from disease control operations.<br><br>
As I have already said, there are existing legal channels for obtaining redress for damage caused by negligence and, of course, Ministers will always be prepared to consider such claims before legal action is commenced. Where, however, a person considers that he has suffered any other form of loss, including, for example, loss of income—whether real or potential—it has always been the view that there should be no statutory liability upon Ministers to pay compensation. This view was supported by the Gowers Committee in 1954 and the Northumberland Committee in 1969 when reporting on epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease. Although these reports were made in connection with foot-and-mouth disease, the principle applies generally to all diseases of animals operations.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
I am unable therefore to recommend acceptance of these amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed with the Minister's reply. He is very insensitive. The Bill allows virtually unrestricted entry on to private land by Government officials. In addition, they may use unlawful methods of killing. This is a new development. The Minister has correctly referred to the situation which has existed to date, but we are considering the situation being promoted by this legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are still not debating the question " That the clause stand part of the Bill". We are on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and the amendment refers specifically to compensation. With all the weight of his ministerial armour and officials, the Minister has brought every gun to bear on this side of the Committee and justified his action by referring to what has happened in the past. But that situation is now being changed.<br><br>
I did not refer to Amendment No. 104 earlier because my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South—West (Mr. Hawkins) is far more experienced on the working of the professional body referred to in that amendment. The Bill changes the existing situation by allowing officials a total right to go on to anyone's land where they suspect there are diseased animals. These are new powers being sought by the Government.<br><br>
If discussions and consultations with the Ministry do not bring agreement, of course there is resort to legal action, but every hon. Member must be aware of the time and money involved in legal action and of the considerable difficulty in bringing an action against central or local government. Those bodies have all the armour on their side and, although our law is supposedly the same for both sides, a late departed friend of this side of the Committee pointed out that taking legal action was easier if one had money and influence.<br><br>
The whole situation is being changed by this legislation. The Minister's reaction to the very reasonable words of my hon. Friend the Member for Nor-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
folk, South—West and to the moderate way in which I presented the case show that he is being insensitive and inflexible in failing to recognise that the legislation he is promoting has changed the situation dramatically. I hope that he will think again.<br><br>
Farmers, land owners and those using land should have a statutory right, in the case of a disagreement with the Ministry, to have the matter referred to an agreed arbitrator so that compensation may be awarded. It is irrelevant to refer to the situation which has existed to date. I am not concerned with that. This legislation changes it by giving a virtually unrestricted right of entry by Ministry officials whose actions can affect the livelihood of farmers and damage livestock and property. The existing situation is not to the advantage of people who could be affected by these actions. Unless we have a more sensitive reply from the Minister, we shall divide on this amendment.<br><br>
I would he happy to accept my amendment or Amendment No. 104 if the Minister says that Amendment No. 104 could be the basis of a Government amendment to be introduced before Report, we would be delighted. I was very unhappy with his reaction and, unless more information is forthcoming, we shall divide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support a good deal of what my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said. The Minister's reply did not cover many of the points originally raised by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
The Minister told us that the law covers the possibility of losses occurring when the Ministry pursues various powers it has been given in regard to animal welfare and care. He said the Ministry already paid the market value for carcases of animals that had to be slaughtered. That would raise a hollow laugh from some farmers who are having animals slaughtered because of brucelosis.<br><br>
I was rather surprised that the Minister used that argument. This has been the constant problem with the brucellosis scheme. Some years ago a number of officials went to a famous meeting in Appleby in my constituency on the problems of compensation. They realised for the first time what those of us on the political side have to face when bad
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
advice is given by officials. It did none of them any harm. The Minister said there was legal redress for negligence, but there is no reference to negligence in the amendment. The amendment refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"any person who has sustained loss or damage by reason of the exercise of powers under this section".</p></blockquote>
We realise that any negligence is likely to be covered, but if there are losses caused, not through negligence, but through the perfectly proper powers given to the Minister under this clause, there should be some form of compensation.<br><br>
The Minister tried to say that the powers under Clauses 9 and 10 are in line with powers in other Acts. We contend—this is what my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield was saying—that these clauses break totally new ground. We would pay a good deal more attention to what the Minister said if he would explain the extent to which the provisions in Clauses 9 and 10 are already matched by existing legislation. We would be very glad to hear that these clauses go no further than existing legislation, but we contend that these powers are totally new and that there must therefore be a new attitude towards compensation for losses. I am glad to hear there is legal redress for many of these matters, but why should we not strengthen what already exists? I do not see any harm in that. We want to hear from the Minister a justification that these powers are comparable to those he already has over other matters. If he can say that, we would be prepared to take much more notice of his remarks and would be tempted not to divide. But if, as I suspect, these are totally new powers and nothing else goes as far, we shall have to divide so that we may point out the need for proper compensation for people who incur losses under these important new powers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not the case that these are new powers which establish a completely new precedent. The Rabies Act 1974 powers are similar and they do not provide for comnensation except for common law negligence. Under the brucellosis scheme, compensation is paid for the cattle, but not for disruption of farm business—for instance, the loss of milk sales or other consequential losses
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
incurred by farmers. It is not true, as hon. Members opposite sought to imply, that these clauses represent a terribly important principle and that we should therefore change our whole approach to compensation in these matters.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely at a loss for words. I am disappointed at the Labour Members who so often rise at the slightest provocation to defend the rights of individuals, particularly against the power of a landlord, but on this occasion the Government. We have not heard a word from the hon. Members for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard) or for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). Unless they are totally shackled by the Government Whip, I hope that they will say something on this matter because natural justice is at stake.<br><br>
I accept some of what the Minister said. I still base my case, however, on the point that the legislation makes a quite dramatic change on the situation which existed hitherto. It provides for unrestricted access to private land. This could well result in substantial financial hardship for a farmer. That could be a tenant farmer, a cause the hon. Member for Brightside has so often championed in the past. Of course, the tenant farmer is championed as much by the Conservative side as by the Labour Members.<br><br>
I am appalled that the Minister has apparently done so little research into this matter that he should expect my hon. Friends and I, having probed his reaction on compensation, to accept his off-hand reply. I am bitterly disappointed. These were not probing amendments. Their purpose was merely to draw an assurance from the Minister that he would table a suitable amendment on Report. However, his totally insensitive attitude only leads me to recommend my hon. Friends to press the amendment. I hope that we may count on support from the Liberal Party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not customary for me to agree with the hon. Member. but I do so for the second time today. I wonder whether I misunderstood him when he seemed to suggest that Ministry officials should not enter land or go on to farms in certain narts of the country. I believe that the Minister should retain that right when

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) should have drawn that point to my attention.

<p><i>Amendments made,</i> No. 89, in page 11, line 32, leave out " the".</p>
<p>No. 90, in page 11, line 33, leave out "all"—[<i>Mr. Strang.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of matters here which are of considerable importance but which we have been unable to cover during the discussion on the amendments. Our attitude throughout the discussion has been that we do not oppose in principle the important new powers which the Government seek. We have been aware of the very serious losses which have occurred in certain parts of the country, and it is therefore right that these powers should be taken. So far in the debate our attitude has been entirely directed at making sure that there are adequate safeguards. We all have some slight hesitation when it comes to destroying wild life even though it be in the interests of animal and, particularly, human welfare.<br><br>
I realise that we are not permitted to discuss rabies because that disease is specifically excluded from the Bill. However, our discussions have led us back to the sort of situation which arose on Clause 5 in respect of hops. Under that provision certain designated areas will he made. On this clause, too, we must ask the Minister what he has in mind.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
<p>which an individual suffers considerable loss during the extermination of diseased animals. The Bill should provide for compensation in the interests of natural justice. For that reason, and in view of the inadequate reply by the Minister, I advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 8.</p>
<p>In which areas does he intend to take immediate action. We have heard of the difficulties in South—West England. The Government must have specific areas in mind where they feel these powers should be used. As soon as Parliament has passed this legislation I am sure that they will use these powers in certain areas. How big are the areas likely to be? Does the Minister feel that there are species other than the badger which might have to be controlled?</p>
<p>We understand that these provisions could be extended much wider in the future. Perhaps new diseases will emerge to be carried by wildlife. As more and more animal diseases are eliminated in this country, in the way that tuberculosis has been—and as we hope brucellosis will be very shortly—we hope that steps will be taken to do something about the ravages of salmonella. That family of bacteria causes one of the greatest ravages of our farm livestock.</p>
<p>We hesitate to eliminate badgers. On my farm there was a thriving badger set which someone destroyed a few years ago. I and many people in our village were furious at this action. It was reported to the police, but without success in identifying the person involved.</p>
<p>We should have a clearer explanation of subsection (5). Its provisions allow the Minister to use methods of destruction which would otherwise be unlawful. What does the Minister have in mind?</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0269">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
<p>Does he propose to reintroduce to designated areas the use of the gin trap? It is illegal and its use causes great distress to people in the countryside. Perhaps there are parts of the country where that beastly machine is still used. Is that one of the methods envisaged under the Bill, and what other forms of illegal destruction might be used? We have discussed possible safeguards in the use of these powers. If the Minister will tell us how he intends to use the powers we shall know whether to prepare amendments for Report if we felt that there were shortcomings within the general principles, of which we approve.</p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree with the principle of the clause. We must attack these diseases, and the clause is a necessary weapon in the Ministry's hands. Earlier in the proceedings the Minister said that the Opposition were being frivolous in some of their objections. But it is right that the Opposition should seek to improve the clause and to write in safeguards. I am still concerned that the Minister waves to one side the question of compensation. Sometimes one has to change and in this case there are fresh circumstances—a fresh use of outlawed methods of killing animals.<br><br>
Compensation should be paid. The cost of going to law is much greater than proceeding by arbitration. Although I am not saying that the Minister would he unreasonable, if an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment is made it is always far less than when something is specified, as we suggested in our amendment.<br><br>
I plead with the Minister, to ensure that the cause of disease in wildfowl be discovered and attacked. We had an outbreak of fowl pest in my area which affected pheasants and wild birds of many kinds. The cause of the outbreak was the spreading of manure from the poultry pens on adjoining land. The poultry houses had had diseased birds in them and the disease affected wild life on the farm. Perhaps the Minister can give some answer on this matter. I hone that he will seek. not only to destroy wild life when it is diseased, but to discover the cause of the disease and to eradicate it.<br><br>
In the instance I have described a wide area covering many square miles of my constituency was involved. Large

populations of wild birds were wiped out and much loss was caused. It was due entirely to the spread from buildings where intensive poultry was kept. There was no question of the wildlife having caught the disease in any other way.<br><br>
I am concerned about the effects of publicity given to the killing of badgers in a particular area. Unless the Minister is prepared to give publicity explaining the reason for and limitation on such killings in the designated area, I fear that other people are going to kill badgers or other wildlife in non-designated areas. On several occasions I have stopped people from killing badgers on an estate which I manage. There are a few badgers in my part of the world. I know where they are, and other people know where they are. Publicity in newspapers sometimes leads people to think that they also have a right to go and kill. If there is a dangerous species in one area, people sometimes believe that it can be called a dangerous species everywhere. The Minister should ensure that publicity is given to make people realise that they cannot take the law into their own hands by killing animals on other land outside the area concerned and that only authorised people have the right to act in this way, anyway.<br><br>
I hope that this clause will not have to be used frequently. None of us wants to see disease spreading in the countryside. We do not want to see the destruction of wildlife, but I repeat that I totally agree with the principles involved. The Ministry has to do this and it is right to have the clause, but it was also right that the Opposition should move the amendments, which were partly probing and partly designed to safeguard the rights of individuals whose land has to be entered to carry out the work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sum up my views on "clause stand part" with some regret. I had hoped that we would have had a positive and constructive amendment to the clause. I endorse the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). It is regrettable with such a dramatic change in the powers given to the Government in the Bill, compensation should not form part of the measure. The Minister has shown an inflexible attitude to our amendments and I do not believe he will have won

many friends among members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Wildfowl Trust, or even in the RSPCA. One of the most telling matters in the clause is that Ministry officials can use methods of killing that otherwise might be unlawful. Our request for the relevant organisations to be consulted and that the rights of the individual and the conservation societies be fully understood has fallen on stony ground.<br><br>
There are one or two other matters on which I would like clarification before we bring the debate on the clause to an end. I remind the Committee of the title to the clause—
<br><blockquote><p>"Power to provide for the destruction of wildlife".</p></blockquote>
Apart from the points we have already made, there are one or two others relating to the drafting, which we find slightly surprising. I hope the Minister and his officials can clarify them. The most notable is the apparent contradiction between Clause 9(6)(<i>a</i>) and 9(11) which appear to be anomalous in references to captive animals. We fully understand that these provisions are being taken with regard to the control of badgers affected by bovine tuberculosis, but we on this side of the Committee would be interested to know to what other species the Ministry envisages the Order might apply, both now and in the future. My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) referred to this, but he has had to leave the Committee and I understand that he has sent a note to the Minister explaining way. But I hope that the Minister will explain the situation to the Committee.<br><br>
I do not think I am out of order in saying that the hon. Member for Ren-frewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), before the last Division, imparted a few words to the Government Whip. He said that the Opposition were right on this one, hut, when it came to the vote, the hon. Gentleman cast his voice with the Government. Unfortunately, on too many occasions in this place—and my hon. Friends are as guilty as Government Members—the House votes on party lines rather than on the merits or demerits of an issue. It is a tragedy, during the Committee stage on a Bill such as this, that party politics and inflexibility
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
seem to rear their heads. Surely it is in Committee that the nitty gritty of an argument should be debated and where points should be discussed fully and properly without party politics.<br><br>
I am bitterly disappointed that some of the amendments we tabled in an effort to improve the clause have not found sympathy with the Government. We on this side of the Committee are concerned with animal welfare, conservation and endangered species. Surely every hon. Member in the House must be concerned about individual liberty and the right of property owners to have some say about who comes on to their land. Although I support the Government when they say that, where a disease has broken out—where a badger set is undoubtedly diseased—there should be a right to go on to the land to remove the disease. But if there is damage to property or to livestock compensation should be paid. Although loss of livestock can be compensated, loss of livelihood and loss to property is not featured in the Bill. It should be because of the additional powers in the Bill. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) that success on the land comes from cooperation from all the people involved.<br><br>
The Government have been unreasonable in their reaction to our amendments. I regret that they have not accepted our co-operation on the matter. The Liberal Member of the Committee has been present and has supported the main Opposition on the amendments upon which we have divided this morning.<br><br>
Because we support the principle of the clause, we shall not seek to divide the Committee on "clause stand part". But I make this final plea to the Minister to give further consideration to some of his answers and attitudes so that improvements can perhaps be made to the clause on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that you, Mr. Costain, or the Committee, wants me to rehearse all the replies that I gave when the amendments were passed, and that applies particularly to the question of compensation. It would he inappropriate and unjustified to alter the arrangements for compensation which already exist.<br><br>
But I will reply briefly to some of the new points raised in this short debate.

I refer first to the immediate action which the Ministry might take, if we should obtain the necessary powers under the clause. This would relate to the current programme with regard to badgers and tuberculosis in the South West. We were able to obtain special powers for badgers and tuberculosis with the co-operation of an hon. Member who introduced a Private Members' Bill. But if this Bill was on the Statute Book, we would designate such areas using this legislation.<br><br>
A number of relatively small areas in Gloucestershire, Avon, Wiltshire, Cornwall, and perhaps elsewhere in the South West, are likely to be covered by Orders under the clause relating to badgers and tuberculosis.<br><br>
We have nothing in mind at present
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
for dealing with the problems of other diseases. In the Bill we are taking powers for use in the future and we cannot predict whether there will be another occasion when wild animals are found to be responsible for transmitting serious diseases to livestock. We have no proposals at present for eradicating salmonellosis, nor do we intend to use different methods of getting rid of badgers. We have explained why we found it appropriate to gas them—</span></p>
