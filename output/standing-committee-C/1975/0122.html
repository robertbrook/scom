	<div class='title'>DUTIES OF MEAT AND LIVESTOCK COMMISSION AS REGARDS CONSULTATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—(20th January</i>)—No. I8, in page 4, line 20, at the end, to insert: "Qualified veterinary surgeons"—[Mr.	<i>Nicholas Winterton</i>].</p>
	<p>10.30 a. m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that while I was talking last time everybody was looking at their watches somewhat frantically, and I am not at all sure that what I said was entirely full of sense. I should therefore like to run over the ground again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the proposed amendment, to secure the inclusion of veterinary surgeons among those classes of people set out in the Bill who should be consulted, because vets play a great part in the whole of the meat and livestock world. We know of their work in curing diseasesand we know of their work, which is even more important, in preventing diseases. They have an intimate knowledge of what goes on from the actual breeding rather than from statistics and the thoughts of people about the breeding of animals. Vets inspect live exports, as will be mentioned on a later amendment, and will be of the greatest value in and an integral part of, the proposed new system of export licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come on now to the part that I was trying to bring to the Committee's attention. Vets also act as LVIs—local veterinary inspectors—responsible for the inspection of carcases for export, largely to our partners in the Common Market. It is on this last duty that I wish to spend a few minutes, because it illustrates the need for the close co-operation with veterinary surgeons and the reason this amendment should be accepted by the Government. It shows, too,
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
that Governments of all hues are inclined to interfere too much in details of trades and businesses which are far better left to those who are dealing with these problems from day today. I can assure the Minister that I do not single out the present Government in particular and that I am not trying to make a party point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am raising this matter, not to attack the Ministry of Agriculture, but in an effort to secure that, in conjunction with the amendment, a better understanding and a working relationship can be arrived at with the vets and the meat trade generally. This is a highly skilled but very important trade to this country. It is a business—as I found out when I telephoned at eight o'clock one morning and everybody was in the office—where, as the lady on the telephone said, "We do not cease for 24 hours a day." That is on the office side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was, therefore, very alarmed and surprised to find a letter from a firm which I know quite well, Messrs. Buitelaar, of Boston, mentioning the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was, as from last Monday, to introduce a new system of debiting exporters of meat with the local veterinary inspector's charges. This is supported by the livestock auctioneers. That is an added reason why the veterinary surgeons should be included in the list of those to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change is, I believe—I perfectly understand it—due to the requirements of the EEC, and particularly Western Germany, where a large number of these exports go. I cannot argue against the principle that, if the Ministry pays. it should have this control and the Government are, of course, responsible to Brussels for the integrity and validity of the signature of the inspectors who are, as I said, veterinary surgeons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should put on record that I believe that the integrity and the standards of veterinary inspectors are very high in this trade and in the whole country. I understand that very few complaints have come through from EEC Member States about the meat exported, although some may have arisen from lack of understanding of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to bring to the attention of the Government the cost of the change and the effect onthe meat export trade, particularly in its competitiveness with its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
main rival—Southern Ireland—over the charges for these livestock veterinary inspectors. Since I received the letter which I mentioned a few moments ago, I understand that there have been certain negotiations and I believe that some alterations have been made and that we are on the way to being satisfied. On the other hand, I do not believe that this matter should in this way be put suddenly into the minds of companies, suggesting an overall charge which would apply to large and small companies alike. So when large companies pay their local veterinary inspectors for this meat inspection as part of the duty for inspecting meat going to the Continent, the veterinary inspector's salary for the year would workout at approximately £17,000 a year. That is what it would be in this particular case for an eight-hour day, five days a week, fifty weeks a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
have this letter from the Managing Director, Mr. Burgess, of Buitelaar, in which he concedes that this system must change, and that the Ministry must pay and be responsible for the validity of the signature of the veterinary inspectors. But he says that more than once or twice he has ventured to suggest that, when it is necessary for a Government Department to effect a policy change, it is better for detailed discussions to take place before implementation, rather than for implementation to he suggested with a date put in it, and then, at the last minute. there have to be discussions with a timetable and a suggested date for implementation which rushes the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this particular case, if that scale of charges had been put into being, it would have worked out that for an eight-hour day, five days a week, the veterinary inspector would have received £17,050 a a year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having some difficulty in relating vets' salaries to the amendment. Can the hon. Gentleman explain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw the Minister's attention to our amendment which seeks to include veterinary inspectors among those to be consulted. I was trying to illustrate the lack of consultation with various bodies in this case and why
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
it would have been far better if all the parties had been consulted earlier. I shall not be on my feet for much longer, but I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendment to include veterinary inspectors, not just for their work in conjunction with the export meat trade, but because of their key position in the whole livestock industry—on farms, in the Ministry, in the meat trade, in the livestock export trade to see that no cruelty occurs and that conditions are right for the exporting of livestock. I believe that they are one of the key sections of the community and should be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to £17,000 per annum being the predicated remuneration of veterinary surgeons under the scheme promulgated by the Ministry, which should have come into effect on Monday. This goes to the very root of the consultation procedure. There are, apparently. second thoughts about this matter. Will my hon. Friend describe to the Committee how that postulated £17,000 compares with remuneration previously earned and the impact of this large differential on the financial liability of carcase exporters?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may be allowed to try to answer my hon. Friend's questions. I have no details as to the viability. The point being made by exporters was that this would damage their competitiveness with Southern Ireland, which exports to the same markets. It is understood that the charges in Southern Ireland would, for the same amount of throughput, be something like half the amount it would have cost this firm under the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from a telephone call that I had yesterday morning that the firm concerned believes that it is now well on the way towards being able to agree a sensible scale which will put the matter right. But there is still the matter of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take one minute only to support my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). He quoted evidence from a constituent of mine who runs a large business in the heart of my constituency and also from another constituent, Mr. Burgess, the managing director of the firm. I do not always see eye to eye with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
those two gentlemen, but on this occasion they are absolutely right. Indeed, I wish the Minister of State would listen to the views of those two gentlemen on the subject of the Meat and Livestock Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will give a considered answer to my hon. Friend, particularly in relation to the difficulties that this company may encounter. It is an important company. It has played an enormous, dominant part in the export of live animals to the Continent. It has high exporting standards. However, that is a matter for another clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give a considered reply to what has just been said by my hon. Friend, a reply that my constituents will respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a. m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has gone a little wide of the substance of the amendment. He has raised a point about the new arrangements for payment for veterinary inspection of meat for export in slaughter houses. He has drawn attention to the Ministry's letter. These proposals would replace the existing arrangements whereby exporters paid for veterinary inspection. Instead, the payment will be paid by public authorities and reclaimed, together with administrative costs, from the exporter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to have the hon. Member's reaction about the arrangements which, as he claims, have been introduced to overcome some of the criticism of the countries to which we export.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this question is rather outside the scope of the amendment, which emphasises the need for consultation with the veterinary side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be clear that the Commission has no responsibility for meat inspection. The 1965 White Paper on the subject, which foresaw the establishment of the Meat and Livestock Commission by the 1967 Act, specifically referred to the fact that these functions were not to be conferred on the Commission, and recorded the Government's view, then as now, that matters touching on public health should remain under public control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change in the payments pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
cedure, therefore, has nothing to do with the Commission and its activities. It is entirely a matter for which the agriculture Departments are responsible and on which the Departments have consulted the interested organisations. Therefore, I do not think that I should go too deeply into this, but I will certainly consider what the hon. Member has said and write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take issue with the Minister. I have not got the White Paper in front of me. However, he relies on some reference to public health remaining under the public health authorities. I would argue that this is certification in relation to an export requirement. It has not to do with public health, as such, operated by local authorities in this country. It is export documentation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point which has been made, but the White Paper does say that in the Government's view matters touching on public health should remain under public control. The position will be that, instead of the exporter having the inspection done under his own initiative, the Government will be responsible for payment of the inspectors, and the cost will be debited to the exporter in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister of State on this matter. Export documentation may require—I do not know, but I suggest this—different criteria from those required by public health authorities in this country, albeit to do with public health. But, in so far as it is export documentation, the Minister cannot excuse himself in this debate merely on the grounds of the White Paper, which, I submit again, refers to public health in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may think that he is making a valid point, but he is overlooking the fact that it may not be United Kingdom public health: but it is still public health. In any case, if one is exporting meat, one has to make sure that the people at the other end have some degree of confidence in what is going on. I am not suggesting that there has been any lack of confidence before, but if they know that the public authority, whether local or national, is responsible for certification, this must be universally accepted by both exporting countries and importers. I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
think that this point, which the hon. Member for Norfolk, South West has brought in to show some degree of support for the amendment, should be pursued too deeply today. It is not particularly the concern of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment—if I can do justice to the hon. Member for Macclesfield, and try to recall what he had to say before the recent confrontation here—would extend specifically the classes of persons whose organisations must be consulted, where their interests are affected by the Commission's activities, to include the veterinary service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is an interesting one. I have also had my attention drawn by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to the increasing role the profession is playing in livestock production. But it should be recognised that the Commission is not confined in its consultation arrangements to consulting only those interests for which statutory provision has been made. In fact, veterinary advice is available to the Commission through its Research Advisory Committee, and played a part in forming the recommendations to the Scientific Study Groups set up by the Commission to examine livestock improvement projects. So there has been and continues to be consultation between the veterinary side and the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether there should be, under the new arrangements proposed in the Bill, a statutory provision for consultation with the veterinary organisations. The list in Clause 3 of persons for whose consultation the Bill provides, is the same, as far as concerns production and distribution, as the list of persons in the 1967 Act. Indeed, at previous sittings I have compared this exactly with the present position under the 1967 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those persons are defined according to their activities, not their professional or other status. Were this list to be extended, we should be concerned that any such extension would be of the same kind. We should also be concerned to ensure that, in defining the scientific activities which would qualify persons to be included in the consultative arrangement, the definition was right also, that it was neither too narrow to embrace the range of scientific advice on livestock production nor too wide to
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
have much meaning—in other words, it would have to represent a genuine improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those grounds I do not consider that the amendment is satisfactory but I shall certainly consider the spirit of it, in other words whether there is more to be done by the Commission itself through its own arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is whether there should be statutory inclusion of this category or whether the present consultation arrangements are adequate. But I submit that on the evidence we have so far there is good reason to believe that the existing livestock and other Committees—Cattle Committee, Sheep Committee, Pigs Committee, Research Advisory Committee, EEC Committee—plus what we know will be the approved arrangements which we have debated over several meetings for consultation between the MLC and the designated organisations, will make sure that the veterinary side is adequately consulted on all these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: T. for one, am disappointed with the Minister"s reply. It is the classic argument for maintaining the 	<i>status quo</i>—"We have got along all right so far. We did a bit on a previous clause regarding the machinery of consultation, and there is nothing to preclude the Commission from having consultations with qualified veterinary surgeons, or whomsoever; so let us not embark on any further amendments." That is the sum content of what the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the list of specified parties on page 4 of the Bill there is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Persons engaged in animal by-products trades."</p></blockquote>
which I interpret to mean people who produce such articles as tripe, pig trotters or gut sausage-skins. If the Minister and those who inspire him in the Ministry can go to extremes in specifying such categories—I would think quite rightly—then why not veterinary surgeons? He has undertaken to look at this matter again, but not, I feel, with a very good heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had the Minister acceded more to the involvement of the veterinary surgeon in the livestock industry as such, as distinct from the public health question in terms of preventive activities and the whole question of breeding and strains,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
and had he coupled that with an assurance that he would look at this matter again between now and Report, we could have moved on happily and resisted a vote on this amendment. As it is now, I look to my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) in his closing remarks to give the Committee guidance. I remain most unhappy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) raised a point which I do not think that the Minister answered—and I wondered whether he would—about the two butchers who serve on the Consumers Committee. This has always seemed rather important to me. Butchers give an immense amount of their own time to practical education of housewives and others about cuts of meat, and so on. I should have thought that their position on the Consumers Committee, if it is to be retained, was of importance. Perhaps I have got the matter wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of veterinary inspectors, I hope that the Minister shows more enthusiasm for including them amongst the Commission's activities. I should have thought that if all those other people are included veterinary inspectors should be included also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will answer my hon. Friend's point in his closing remarks. I shall endeavour briefly to sum up my views on what the Minister has said. I appreciate the sympathy which he indicated that he feels towards the amendment, although I feel somewhat disappointed that he is not prepared to meet tills amendment and accept it as part of the clause at this stage of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is aware that the functions of the MLC, which have been spelled out many times already in our debates, include promoting, breeding programmes, progeny testing, registration of herds, and so on. In all these matters veterinary inspectors, veterinary officers, vets of all types and descriptions throughout Britain, are involved, and are an important sector of our agricultural community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the categories of person already included in the schedule, it is somewhat surprising that vets are not included. The Minister said that the list of persons and categories of person included in the Bill is exactly that of the1967 Act. He seemed to be implying that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
1967 Act is infallible. Personally, I do not think that the 1967 Act, as good as it was, is infallible. I see good reason for including vets in the list, and that is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be out of order at this stage, Mr. Costain, to launch into any argument on matters which come up under Clause 8 which provides for the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power to regulate exportation of animals in the interests of their welfare."</p></blockquote>
However, I know from my own experience, having travelled from this country to the Continent with a consignment of animals, the importance of vets in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will feel able to do that on Clause 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Costain. I shall certainly heed your warning and not venture down that path at this stage. But where animals are concerned, vets are absolutely vital and I feel that the Minister could show a little grace and a little willingness by meeting this simple and straightforward amendment at this stage, rather than putting off the occasion until Report, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this group of persons could only improve the functions of the MLC and should, as of right, be included in the list of persons specified in the Schedule. I hope that the Minister, in the light of what my hon. Friends have said, will concede the amendment to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any argument between us on this matter. I have not said that vets are not vital. Of course they are. The point made by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) is relevant, because he has quoted from the list, and in support of the amendment he has more or less helped me. He has rightly claimed that vets are included in a number of organisations. There are
	<br><blockquote><p>"Persons employed in livestock production."</p></blockquote>
No one would say that vets are not interested in that; they are bound to be in on it already. Livestock traders and livestock auctioneers are included in the list. I presume that the hon. Member's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
hon. Friends would know more about that. The list also includes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authorities operating slaughterhouses and livestock and meat markets.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Wholesalers of meat and importers of meat…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Producers of bacon."</p></blockquote>
I think that in every category on this list vets are bound to be there. I have made the point, which I believe is important, that the livestock committees and other committees of the MLC, including the Research Advisory Committee, are also very much involved. I do not underrate the importance of vets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing whether vets should be designated as a category. The point is that vets are involved in livestock production and they are included in the relevant organisations which will be designated, but veterinary surgeons, as such, may not be appropriate as a category because what matters is the function they have rather than their professional status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.

However, I take the point made by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) that the I967 Act is not a tablet of Moses coming down from the mountain. It is something which has been the basis for our consideration. However, the 1967 Act, as well as representations and consultations with the MLC and others, should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Veterinary Association has written to us on this matter and I assure the Committee that we will take another look at this in relation to the MLC to see whether there is adequate representation of vets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There are, however, certain dangers, because one may get a whole crowd of other people saying that other categories have an interest as well as vets. I do not want to name them because it may tempt them. Once we start that, we get duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point on which we can all agree is that we want to ensure that the veterinary interests are well represented. I claim that they are already, but we will take a look at the matter with the MLC and see whether anything more needs to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is, I hope, a portent for the future, that at last the Government have begun to show a degree of flexibility. I am sure that that will be good for us all and that we shall, as a result, be able to get through our business a good deal more quickly. It certainly helps when the Government are flexible.

I do not know what the attitude of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that the amendment seeks to probe this matter was given on Second Reading, when the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food explained the need for some kind of subsidy to the National Proficiency Tests Council. The Minister explained that that body
	<br><blockquote><p>"which devises the tests, has found it impossible to survive without a modest measure of Government support."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1273.1</p></blockquote>
The Minister went on to explain the ties that the Council has with the Agricultural Wages Board and the Agricultural Training Board. In view of the talks that the Minister obviously had had, it had been decided to give some kind of grant, which might well be limited to £25,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief. After all, we now have a certain amount of good will in the Committee. The Administration is giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are a little in the dark. The Bill as now worded gives the Minister power to make a grant to "any body of persons". There may be another body of persons not in the same position as the National Proficiency Tests Council. From what the Minister said, it is quite clear that this body, with this particular task, has this anxiety over funding its work and needs a
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
grant for that purpose. It follows, therefore, that the Minister has in mind no other organisation which might be in this same difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If so, I must tell the Parliamentary Secretary, who I understand is to reply to this amendment, that there seems to be no need to make the clause so wide that almost any body of persons would be eligible for this kind of subsidy provided that it fulfilled the existing conditions. It could be some other body of persons in existence now or to be established in the future which would not need this kind of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be good enough to tell us now, because it is not generally known, why the Council needs this money and why it has been singled out in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) for the spirit in which he addressed his remarks to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Clause 4 is to allow the Government to give financial assistance by way of grant to the National Proficiency Tests Council to enable it to continue with those aspects of its work which have a national application. But the Council is neither a "body corporate" nor a "statutory body"—a point which will arise on the next amendment—and it is therefore not appropriate to refer to it by name in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, as presently constructed, will apply to the Council without specific reference. When the hon. Gentleman said that it empowers the Minister to make a grant to any body, I realise that he meant any body which will fulfil the fairly detailed requirements outlined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also refers to the Agricultural Training Board. That is a training body, not a testing organisation, as the hon. Gentleman knows. The Board submits its trainees to the NPTC tests and, indeed, the Board values the existing arrangement and wishes it to continue. I think the hon. Minister will agree that the body running the tests and the body getting the grant for the tests should be autonomous from the body which has the responsibility for training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With statutory entitlement to a wage premium dependent on the passing of tests, it is undesirable that the training body
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
should also be responsible for the functions covered by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman described this as a probing amendment. I have met his point that we cannot refer to the NPTC directly in the Bill. Furthermore, it would be a mistake to pay these grants to the training board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also bear in mind that, looking to the future, it may well be that some other body will emerge—I think it is unlikely—which will carry out this function. Therefore, the clause leaves us the option to pay a grant to such a body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move Amendment No. 22, in page 4, line 37, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that those tests are approved by the National Proficiency Tests Council."</p></blockquote>
This is the stage where we can ask questions in some detail about the way in which these tests—which have been built up over the years and which are now organised by the National Proficiency Tests Council, operate and their effectiveness. Like other members of the Committee, I have been able to spend a little time examining the report dated February 1975 which was submitted to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by the City and Guilds of London Institute and which is entitled "Proficiency Testing in Agriculture and Horticulture in England and Wales." This document gives us a good deal of detail and background to the matters with which the new clause concerns itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the tests and the standards—which is what the amendment is about—it does no harm at the beginning to draw attention to the results of the questionnaire which this study carried out during the course of its findings. The results are a big clap on the back for the tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question I was whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"Proficiency tests play an important part in training,"</p></blockquote>
and 86 per cent. of those who replied agreed that that was so. The second question was whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"Proficiency tests encourage trainees to make an effort."</p></blockquote>
That secured the highest percentage answer of the whole questionnaire came,
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
where 89 per cent. of those asked out of 125 people who completed the questionnaire agreed. These questionnaires were sent to people engaged in agriculture and horticulture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third question was whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"Proficiency tests help to ensure that trainees learn the right things."</p></blockquote>
This is important, because some of us have seen tests in one form or another where one wondered whether those being tested were learning appropriate subjects. There, 81 per cent. of those replying agreed that that was so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that these tests do good and have met with a good measure of support. In passing it would do no harm to point out some of the things which were somewhat critical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To Question 8, whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"Too much time is required arranging for the boys to be tested,"</p></blockquote>
53 per cent. of those replying answered that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the point which sums up these tests is that people were asked whether they thought
	<br><blockquote><p>"Passing a proficiency test does not mean that a boy can do his job properly."</p></blockquote>
Sixty-one per cent. agreed with that, implying that the passing of these tests is not the start and finish of ability to do a job on a farm, in agriculture or in horticulture, properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, as the Minister explained on Second Reading, the effect of passing these tests is that those who pass them are entitled to a 10 per cent. premium on the statutory minimum wage. My own feeling is—I should be interested to know what the hon. Lady the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) thinks—that the majority of those who pass the tests would, in practice, get more than 10 per cent. over the statutory minimum wage in any case. In saying that, I hope one is not appearing to discourage the operation of these tests or discourage people from taking part in them, because I believe them to be most useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that these tests are properly organised, devised, structured, administered, and that the results and holders of the certificates carry with them a degree of confidence throughout the whole industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause stands, no serious provision is made for seeing that the tests are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
properly organised and supervised. I am not at all sure that it would be wise for Parliament to allow this clause to go through unless we are absolutely assured that a body of some sort, which has the confidence of the whole industry, will be, as stated in sub-section (1) (a):
	<br><blockquote><p>"devising, formulating and promoting proficiency tests in crafts related to agriculture in England and Wales."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee whether that definition applies to horticulture. I imagine that there is a definition in an obscure Act somewhere which means that horticulture is also embraced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sub-section continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"formulating standards for those tests, and revising those tests and standards from time to time;"</p></blockquote>
At this moment I am sure that the National Proficiency Tests Council is the best body to perform that function. As the Parliamentary Secretary said, it is unlikely that another body will emerge. That may or may not be so, but I shall return to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is absolutely essential that Parliament is wholly assured that there is a body somewhere which is fully recognised by the whole industry—preferably one body only, rather than a whole multiplication of organisations which have this responsibility—and we should think seriously about how we could insert, at this point, a statement that it should be the National Proficiency Tests Council which has the job given to it by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise the difficulty referred to in the previous debate by the Parliamentary Secretary. I think that, leaving aside his reservations, it is clear that at this moment the National Proficiency Tests Council is the best body to perform these functions. At present, I understand, these tests are organised on a county basis. I believe that there are one or two counties carrying out these tests which are not recognised by the Council. That means that, for the majority of counties carrying out this work, the approval which is set upon their tests by the National Proficiency Tests Council gives them an air of respectability and adds confidence to the value of those tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is divergence between the way in which the tests are organised between one county and another. I notice that, in paragraph 25 of the City and Guilds of London Institute document I have referred
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
to, talking about this matter, we are told that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"has led to a variety of policies and procedures at county level, which cause problems for the central body."</p></blockquote>
I can understand that, but at the same time it is essential that we have a central body in charge of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These tests have emerged from the grass roots. Paragraph 3I of the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is recognised that the first suggestions for new or revised tests are likely to come from the industry and will probably be made to NPTC."</p></blockquote>
That implies, again, the important role that the Council plays at the moment in evolving these tests. It shows also that the way in which the tests are devised is on the basis of what people at the grass roots want. I am sure that Parliament would wish that the way in which these tests are devised should come from the grass roots. Indeed, the Council itself has emerged from the grass roots. We read in the document that these tests had their origins in the Young Farmers' Club movement and moved on to be dealt with by the National Proficiency Tests Committee, which then gave rise to the present body we know, the National Proficiency Tests Council for Agriculture and Horticulture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So this body has a pedigree and a record of work with which the Committee would not argue. I realise that there may be some doubts about the future of the National Proficiency Tests Council, and reading again from this most helpful document I see, under "Recommendations," proposals that the NPTC may emerge in the future
	<br><blockquote><p>"either as an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or of the Agricultural Training Board."</p></blockquote>
That recommendation was put to the Minister in February 1975. We would like to know how the Minister's mind is working on these matters. He has told us that the Council is not a body corporate and, therefore, for some reason which I am afraid I do not understand, it would be wrong to refer to it in the course of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister agrees that it is important to have a body which supervises these tests and carries out all the functions laid down in subsection(1)(	<i>a</i>), how do we go about setting up the NPTC as a body corporate? Is it not possible that we could do that? It may be difficult to do that at this stage of our endeavours, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
I wonder whether it would be possible in some way to have it made more respectable or more part of the establishment during the remaining stages of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that these possibilities have been considered. I see that a proposal was put forward that the NPTC might become incorporated
	<br><blockquote><p>"within the national validating and examining body proposed in the Report of the Joint Advisory Committee on Agricultural Education, 1973."</p></blockquote>
I see from page 25 of the City and Guilds of London document that that is the course of action which is recommended by the City and Guilds of London Institute. We seem to be coming a little closer to where we might get to make this body more respectable, so that we could name it in the Bill. I imagine that if it moved within the proposed validating and examining body it would be perfectly in order to include it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told in paragraph 41 of the City and Guilds of London Institute report that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The recent work of the NPTC on test development, examiner training and test organisation and administration has been a sound investment."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, very few criticisms have emerged in the course of this independent report on the work of proficiency testing about the way that this body has gone about its duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulties suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary, and, in view of them, it would be difficult to press the exact terms of the amendment. However, this is a good case. It should not be left in the air. We ought to be more specific about how these tests should be organised, and I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Joan Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome very much the standardisation of the tests. It is a sensible thing to do. It was crazy to have different standards in different parts of the country. I welcome the fact that the Government have decided to give a grant towards that. However, I regret that there is to be no grant towards the cost of the tests for those who take them, because those who will take the tests in agriculture are low paid in relation to people working in industry. Even when they have taken the tests and are entitled to the premium, it is low—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Lady sure that she is not speaking to the next amendment? It would be proper to
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard) both acknowledged the valuable work done by the National Proficiency Tests Council. I want to put on record our appreciation of the enormous contribution which the chairman and the members of the Council make to agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland quoted at considerable length from the report of the City and Guilds of London Institute, which showed that some trainee farmers did not regard tests as the be-all and end-all of agricultural proficiency. I hope not. I hope that in no industry do people regard a test certificate as final proof of ability to do a job, whether it be one where academic qualifications are required, as in engineering, or anything else. Hon. Members should not forget that their job requires no qualifications, so we, above all, should be conscious that the ability to pass tests can never prove that a person is good at his or her job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked whether horticulture was covered. Sub-section (5) states that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"'agriculture' includes horticulture and forestry."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the clause is to allow the Minister to give financial support to the NPTC. The Council is now a body corporate, not a statutory body, and therefore it is inappropriate to refer to it by name in the Bill. Sub-section (4) (	<i>a</i>) describes exactly the present functions of the Council, and it will apply to the Council no other reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said already, circumstances could arise—though it is a remote possibility—leading to the creation of a body similar to the NPTC. Even if the Council could properly be mentioned in the legislation, it would be wrong to give it power to veto the payment of a grant to another body by refusing to accept its tests. It may be decided later to have a separate body for horticulture, or for forestry. Provided that body fulfils the conditions set out in the Bill, it may emerge without need to modify the legislation. I am sure that the hon. Member would agree that we should not want the NPTC
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
to have power to oversee its work, and that it should be able to organise tests in its own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City and Guilds report recommended that the NPTC might become the agency of the Ministry. That recommendation has been strongly opposed by the industry and the Government, and I believe that it would be opposed by the Committee. Surely we are all agreed that. it would be wrong to turn such a body, an independent body whose responsible members are the best people from the industry, into a creature of the Ministry. Surely we are in favour of pluralism and independence in these matters, although, of course, the body produces its annual report and accounts and is subject to much scrutiny, since it is in receipt of public funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to reassure the hon. Member for Westmorland. I understand his reaction, and his case for writing the NPTC into the Bill, but I hope that on balance he will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that it would be wrong to bring the Council into the orbit of the Ministry. I think that we could make the Council more independent, though someone said that it should be made more respectable by being brought into the Ministry's orbit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the standardisation of tests. I should be in favour if the same standardised tests were applicable all over the country, so that one knew that a trainee going from Bedford to Norfolk, for example, had passed a test which would be the same as for the farm to which he was going. But there are tests which are needed for a particular part of the country, or are required more in that area than elsewhere. They cannot be entirely standardised, because many skills are required in certain areas and not in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had certain complaints that young foresters have had great difficulty in attending sufficient forestry courses to become proficient and pass the tests. Is the Minister happy that enough facilities are offered to them to become proficient and to take advantage of the tests? In my area there are a large number of Forestry Commission woodlands, as well as private woodlands. Probably because the woodlands staff is small, there is great difficulty, even compared with a farm, in
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
allowing one trainee to take the proficiency tests. If the Minister is satisfied that everything possible is being done to enable them to do so, I shall be happy, but I have heard rumours that the trainees are not happy about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) touched upon the subject of harmonisation in our country. We are all aware that in agriculture we are having to harmonise in a much wider area. Will there be talks with the EEC about this proposal, and about possible ideas for harmonisation of tests throughout the Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point made by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) about standardisation, and the fact that in some parts of the country a particular skill is in greater demand than it is in others. But the vast bulk of the tests, whether on tractor maintenance or some aspect of livestock husbandry, require the same skill and knowledge throughout the country. It is therefore right, especially as there is movement of workers from county to county, that the tests should be roughly the same, with a degree of standardisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because forestry is such a sparse and far-flung industry, there is a problem in getting forestry workers gathered together in sufficient numbers whenever there is a central test or central activity. But I know of no case where particular difficulty has arisen. The Forestry Commission adopts a most progressive role in training If the hon. Member knows of individual problems, I shall be happy to take them up with the Forestry Commission, with which we have a good relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) raised the question of the EEC. We have had no suggestion from the Commission or the Community that harmonisation would be appropriate here. The movement of farm workers between Member States is minimal. We are devising the tests, and the NPTC is monitoring them without reference to what is happening in the Member States of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
clear that it would be wrong to press the amendment, in view of the legal matters, which some of us find difficult to follow, concerning whether a body is a body corporate and therefore whether it ought to be named in an Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) was right to be worried about the standardisation of tests. I should make it clear that a call for standardisation was not part of what I sought to say. Indeed, I referred to the different county arrangements in the organisation of the tests and to the differences among them. We should not try to go for standardised tests, but they should bear relationship to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we move on to the next two amendments we shall be discussing financial arrangements. The whole business of the Government's overseeing these matters will allow us to return to the question in a different context.

	<br><blockquote><p>"of not more than £30,000, or".</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Secretary must give us an explanation about the money that is to be made available to the National Proficiency Tests Council. The Bill gives the Minister a blank cheque. He can give any sum of money, subject to queries that may be raised by the Treasury. But at a time when the Treasury is concerned with expenditure running not into the few thousands of pounds that we are talking about this morning, but thousands of millions, one cannot expect officials of the Treasury to give much time to the bagatelle that we may be giving to the Council. I assume that it is a small sum. We are in some doubt about it for several reasons. The right hon. Gentleman the Minister said on Second Reading that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The amount involved is about £25,000 a year."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1273.]</p></blockquote>
That is quite clear in its context. But what puzzles me is that in the annual report for 1974–1975 of the National Proficiency Tests Council for Agriculture and Horticulture we read:
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The finances of the Council were able to remain stable due to the continuing support of the Ministry of Agriculture."</p></blockquote>
According to the accounts, there was a grant of £10,000 in 1974 and one of £16,000 for the year ending 31st March 1975.

What authority had the Minister for giving that money? If the authority existed—and one must assume that it did—what is the necessity now for giving him this fresh authority? I draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the last sentence of the paragraph relating to finance, which says
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Council only needed to call upon approximately £16,000 of the £25,000 which was available from the funds of the Ministry of Agriculture."</p></blockquote>
That is crystal-clear, even to me. The funds of the Ministry have been made available to the Council up to £25,000. Somehow or other the Minister already has that power. If £25,000, according to the Minister, is all that the NPTC seeks to have in the future, why need we introduce this provision? Why need we spend any time in dealing with the matter if the Council is already getting what it asks for?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is to insert not £25,000 but £30,000. It is perhaps a probing amendment. There was a time when Bills included precise figures, when we had a constant-value pound. It may be that £25,000 is not enough for the Council if the Government continue to allow the value of the pound to decline at its present rate of 15 per cent. a year. Therefore £30,000 might be the appropriate figure for the Council in the following year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary wants a blank cheque, if he says that he wants to be able to give this body—or any other body that has the power under the Clause—any sum, it is tantamount to saying that we do not know what the rate of inflation is to be. The pound may be collapsing. It may one day be worth only half its present value. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is not the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and cannot say much about the rate of inflation, but I think he can say what should be the maximum amount of money for the Council. I hope he will explain why there must be statutory authority to give £25,000 to an organisation when he already has the power to give that sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Government are making this money available. Many people here connected with the industry will remember that the proficiency tests got off to a very shaky start. There were great difficulties in some parts of the country in getting committees established and getting the whole scheme under way. One of our great difficulties was who was to finance the committees and pay for the test examiners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though I welcome the proposed grant; I regret that there is no proposal to make a grant towards the cost of the tests available to those taking them. This is a heavy burden upon farm workers whose wages are not high in comparison with the earnings of industrial workers. Moreover, the premiums which they receive following successful results in the proficiency tests are not high. Those premiums, in relation to the basic rate, have been losing ground over the past year or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The take-up of proficiency tests varies tremendously between different parts of the country. It varies because some areas—for instance, the area represented by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body)—is a fairly high wage area in relation to agriculture. The take-up there certainly was fairly low. I think it was low because people were already getting the rate that they would get if they passed the proficiency tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the question of helping farm workers with the cost of these tests is an important question. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will comment on it and that the Ministry will be willing to consider granting something towards the costs of these tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In referring to my constituency, the hon. Lady's figures were absolutely correct. Might not the reason be that, although in that area we have probably the most highly skilled farm workers in the country, we also have many thousands of unskilled employees who need very limited skills—they are employed on cutting vegetables, and so on. Many of them, as the hon. Lady knows only too well, are women workers. We have thousands of women farm workers. In this respect, we are almost unique in the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point that Mr. Body has made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady must not refer to the hon. Member by name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Costain. Some hon. Members refer to you as Mr. Costain and others refer to you as Mr. Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is that travelling expenses and loss of wages are borne by the organisations involved. I suggest that that is wrong and that help should be given towards travelling expenses and loss of earnings. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will comment on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady, with her close involvement with the National Union of Agricultural Workers, comment on how many of her members she thinks have taken these proficiency tests? The hon. Lady will see from the report that the percentage of tests taken to total number of workers is very small, I suggest to her that most of those tests are not taken by genuine farm workers earning their living on a weekly wage. It is more likely that they are taken by young farmers and others who take advantage of the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As for employed workers, the people taking the test are the young people coming into the industry. Generally speaking the older workers are not taking the tests. I think that happens because, having worked in the industry for most of their lives, they do not feel disposed to take a test to prove that they can do the job that they have been doing for most of their lives. That is why there is such a low take-up by older workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) have made fair and viable points. I shall deal first with the basic observation of the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) about the control of the money which will be made available to the NPTC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can reassure the hon. Member that the money which has been paid in recent years has been paid legally, the statutory basis for these payments being the Appropriation Acts. It is not uncommon for Governments to make payments on this sort of scale for a short period using the Appropriation Acts as the statutory basis, and subsequently to introduce legislation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
which puts the payments on a proper footing. There was an illustration of that only yesterday with the payment of grubbing grants to people who, because of the EEC, wanted to get out of apple and pear production. In 1973—or was it 1971?—the Conservative Minister of Agriculture introduced a scheme very quickly, and it was not until 1974 that the actual legislation was passed, putting the matter on a statutory basis. That is the present position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For how many years has the taxpayers' money been used in this way without statutory authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the money has been paid to the NPTC since it came into operation three years ago. I think I am right in saying that under the old arrangements there was no financial support. If I am mistaken about what happened under the arrangements made by the Federation of Young Farmers Clubs, I shall certainly let the hon. Gentleman know later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the hon. Gentleman's gut point about fixing the limit at £30,000. I understand his arguments. We are discussing a grant which recently has been of the order of £10,000 and, more latterly, £16,000. Our thoughts on what the rate of inflation is likely to be in the coming years would enable us to continue to pay the sort of money we have been paying recently—in real terms—for quite a number of years, and stick within the limit of £30,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, Governments naturally want flexibility for the future. I believe that there is a strong case for writing in a financial ceiling and allowing it to be altered in the years ahead through an affirmative resolution. I undertake to give the matter very serious consideration and to come back to it on Report. I should prefer to do that, rather than accept the amendment outright at this stage. We want to consider more closely the full implication of the limit of £30,000, particularly as we were not aware of the figure of £30,000 until this morning because of the printing error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside. She has raised a very important matter. Her knowledge of the industry enables her to be very close to many of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
county committees and to many of the leading people associated with this work throughout England. Undoubtedly some of these committees have had difficulty, certainly at their outset, in becoming self-supporting, as they must be. It is also true that the cost of the test is a substantial individual cost to many farm workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our problem—I am afraid this is a rather repetitive phrase at the present time—is that Government funds are limited. I should like to be more generous on these matters. One opportunity for improvement might be through the Agricultural Training Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the new entrants scheme—the younger people taking these tests constitute the bulk—the ATB makes a handsome contribution. In fact, the ATB pays the bulk of the total cost to the worker of taking these proficiency tests. In some instances an employer pays, but, notwithstanding that, in many cases the worker himself has to pay the money and, given the level of the farmworkers wages, that is sometimes a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also referred to the size of the craft premium. This is clearly very pertinent. The bigger the premium, the bigger the differential, the bigger the incentive to the worker to embark on training and, above all, to embark on securing a test certificate and craft status within the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the £6 limit in this industry, as in others, has been to erode the differential. The differential in percentage terms has naturally varied throughout the years, but my hon. Friend has a right to expect the Agricultural Wages Board seriously to consider the point he made that this is clearly an important matter—namely, getting the differential right, getting sufficient incentive for workers to take these tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that at this stage I cannot be more helpful, but we will certainly continue to look at the question of financial support and, in particular, at the contribution at present made by the Agricultural Training Board to workers for these tests. With those remarks, therefore, and particularly as I have agreed to look at the question of the £30,000 limit, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will he prepared to withdraw
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
what he has described as perhaps a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to preempt what my hon. Friend the Member for Holland and Boston (Mr. Body) might say in response, except to repeat how glad I am that the Parliamentary Secretary has agreed to look at this matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to raise another point, before the Parliamentary Secretary replied, on why the Government have moved away from the financial recommendations of the City and Guilds of London Institute, but I think that it will be in order for me to raise that matter on the stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain, I assume we can have a vote on Amendment No. 23, if we wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there will be no need for any further Divisions, as we are now making progress with such good will spreading across the Floor of the Committee, and I hope that on this occasion the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with this amendment, particularly in view of his remarks earlier about independence. I did not catch every syllable of what he said, but, if I recall correctly, it was to the effect that these bodies ought to be trusted, and given some kind of independence, and should not be beholden overmuch to any directives from the Ministry of Agriculture. If that was the general sense of
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
his argument, undoubtedly he will be sympathetic to this proposal to delete subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather a slur upon a body such as the Agricultural Training Board or the National Proficiency Tests Council to have conditions imposed upon it by the Minister. Before the Minister decides how much should be given in grants, there will no doubt be talks between his officials and those of the National Council. The Minister will want to know from the National Council how the money is to be spent. He will no doubt have had some influence on the work of the council up to that point and be confident that it will discharge its functions and carry out his policy as it had indicated it would do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems, therefore, unnecessary that we should insert a subsection which is couched in the words that the draftsmen have chosen. I remind the Parliamentary Secretary of those words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A payment under this section may be made on such conditions as the Minister thinks fit to impose, including conditions for restricting the purposes for which it can be used".</p></blockquote>
Is it necessary to legislate in respect of the council, or any other body of persons who may be selected by the Minister, in such language? That appears to be a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all in favour—I have sufficiently indicated this already—of fairly tight statutory control over authority. That is right on expenditure, and on all matters where we are called upon to legislate. We should not leave doors open. But it is unnecessary on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself will decide the body of persons which is to receive the payment. It is surely unnecessary to go so far as to impose conditions upon it in the way suggested by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there will be a continuing arrangement between the Ministry and the National Council, or such other body as is chosen. It will be continuing in much the same way as it has since I97I, or whenever it was that this scheme began. There will be trust on both sides. If there is not, there can be no justification for selecting the particular body of persons to receive such grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider that this subsection is not necessary, and that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
should not have any surplusage in any Act of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My name appears on Amendment No. 23. I approached this matter, not knowing that the two amendments were to be linked, from a slightly different standpoint. My hon. Friend says that the Minister should not be in a position to make conditions, but I, perhaps from a more gloomy point of view, assumed that that is what the Government were determined to have. I wondered, therefore, how we could modify the type of power which the Minister is taking for himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the view that if the Minister is to lay down conditions, impose restrictions, and so on, he must do it in full consultation with various bodies. I felt it right that, before the Minister imposed conditions and paid out grants, he should do it in consultation with the Agricultural Wages Board of England and Wales, with the Agricultural Training Board, and with the National Proficiency Tests Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we come back to our stumbling block of a few minutes ago, when the Parliamentary Secretary told us about the difficulty of incorporating the words "the National Proficiency Tests Council" in the statute. Naturally I accept that reservation, but I believe that, if the Minister is determined to give himself these powers, Parliament should be assured that he is in no danger of doing so in an arbitrary way. This is a familiar discussion in Committees on whatever Bill is going through—that the one thing Parliament always desires is to ensure that, before a Minister does something which can affect the lives and work of people and organisations outside Parliament, he has had the benefit of the views of all those affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will tell us that Amendment No. 23 is out of order because of the words "the National Proficiency Tests Council". I accept that, but, at the same time, would he not tell us whether we could include a form of words which ensured that the Minister consulted with all interested bodies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we could consider on Report inserting the words, after the word "Minister",
	<br><blockquote><p>"having consulted with all bodies which he feels would be fit…"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
and then describe what the subsection is about. I think this would be helpful and would give more confidence within the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed earlier how the standards of the proficiency tests, and the way in which they are carried out, should be policed. Perhaps "policed" is the wrong word. "Overseen" is perhaps a better word. The Minister is taking these powers unto himself; one can hardly read subsection (3) in any other way. Clearly, the Minister himself will be the arbiter of whether the tests are efficiently run, of a sufficiently high standard, and so on. If this is the power which he clearly is taking to himself, we must be assured that, in the use of those powers, he is taking full views from everyone in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I shall again be able to reassure the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) and perhaps his hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 73 calls for the deletion of subsection (3). The object of that subsection is to enable the Minister to make payment subject to conditions. The conditions will be those necessary to exercise proper control over transactions financed from public funds. In accordance with Government accounting procedures, the Council would, for example, be required to present estimates for inclusion in the Ministry's estimates. It would be necessary for the accounts to be open to audit. There is no intention of placing conditions upon the Council which would bring in their train far too detailed a control, but we must ensure that Government money is spent only on those activities approved by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the remarks of the hon. Member for Holland with Boston, and I was a little surprised that he seemed to be suggesting that we should dole out this money without scrutinising what was being done with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh no!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Gentleman has clarified that point, albeit from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was assuming that the Minister knew his job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I think this will wrap this bit up. I said that I thought that this should be left as an independent body and not made an agency of the Ministry. That was because I felt that a body which was independent and was doing its job well should be allowed to get on with it. It was not because I thought that it should not be subject to some financial control, or that the money which it received from the taxpayer should not be open to scrutiny. Therefore, it is necessary to see that proper audit facilities exist and that the accounts are presented in a way that enables us and hon. Members to see precisely what is happening to public money. I think that, on reflection, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will agree that this is right and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the other amendment calling for consultation with the Agricultural Wages Boards, the Agricultural Training Board, and the National Proficiency Tests Council. I have already dealt with the question why it is inappropriate to refer in the Bill to the NPTC. We do, of course, consult the two Boards, but the purpose of the conditions is essentially to see that the grant is spent for proper purposes and that it may be reclaimed if it is not. It seems quite unnecessary for it to be made mandatory for the Minister to consult with these bodies. Clearly if a particular situation or aspect developed which made such consultation desirable he would have no hesitation in availing himself of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry consults with NPTC all the time in relation to money which it receives, and with the AWB and the ATB where appropriate and with other organisations throughout the industry. There would be no advantage in writing into the legislation that the Ministry should be obliged to consult those two organisations in the industry with regard to any conditions which we may want to lay on the NPTC, particularly the conditions primarily relating to the control of public money and the proper scrutiny of how it is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please do not. "Saved by the bell" would be the appropriate expression there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary in his reply seemed principally to be taking exception in Amendment No. 23 to writing in a duty to consult these particular bodies. It seemed that it was to naming the bodies that he was taking the greatest exception. Perhaps I could repeat my earlier request, namely, whether he would consider writing into the Bill only a duty to consult bodies which appear to him to have an interest in these matters, and not specifying the organisations as the amendment does. Would he perhaps take that away with a view to drafting something on those lines, perhaps more vaguely, for Report? It would be helpful if he could consider that and would assist the Committee enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. For the reasons that I have given, I do not think that that would be appropriate or desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may risk fluttering a little the harmony of the Committee, because on this matter I speak mainly for myself. I know that I do not agree with my hon. Friends about a good deal of the past philosophy of agricultural training. The major row over the Agricultural Training Board took place just before I came into the House, but I have always thought that agriculture should have direct responsibility for its training. I have never seen anything wrong in that philosophy, even the original philosophy of the Agricultural Training Board. There are areas where technical proficiency is helpful and profitable to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
the industry. However, I do not consider that at this time we should be giving our blessing to organisations such as the National Proficiency Tests Council, however small and cheap they may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of this matter comes from the young farmers and their proficiency tests, which I suppose on the whole have proved a competitive goal over 30 years or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The desire of the National Union of Agriculture Workers—I am sorry that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard) has left the Committee, because I believe that her knowledge of this matter would be helpful—to introduce various categories of skilled worker into the agricultural wages set-up. in order to get one or two categories paid above the minimum wage was, in my view, erroneous at the time. In practical terms very few agricultural workers receive the minimum wage. Nearly all, in my exeperience. receive a figure considerably above the minimum wage, and as time goes on I suspect that the minimum wage will have less and less relevance in our industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having become saddled with the requirements for professional categories, if I may put it like that, it was then necessary to have an independent body to do the examining and set them up. Therefore, bureacracy marches on, and we now have a highly complicated wage structure, compared with the old. straightforward one. We have this Council. paid for out of central Government funds. and yet the practical farmers to all intents and purposes ignore both. They pay wages above the minimum. and, as the hon. Lady said in answer to my earlier intervention, the average mature agricultural worker will not go off and learn how to do one of these things and then take a test in root hoeing and singling or some of the more esoteric tests which the National Council has put on to deal with the few cases concerned. I am glad to inform the Committee that the 12 people who took a course in watercress handling actually passed the test last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, agricultural training and the Agricultural Training Board have taken a substantial step forward. do not want to be looked upon as a Luddite and so old-fashioned that I believe it should not happen. I held, at a
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
time when it was appropriate, a number of such courses on my own farm, and my own men and my neighbours' men found them immensely useful. However, if I had suggested to any of them that at the end of the day—they were nearly all one-day courses—they should then take an exam, not one of those chaps would have agreed to attend a particular day course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have got ourselves into a bureaucratic muddle, and this seems to be an opportunity where we could do something about it. I am certainly not in favour of the clause, and I am not in favour of the National Proficiency Tests Council. I believe that its objectives can be carried out without the overheads and without Government expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A "Clause stand part" debate allows one the opportunity of fairly general comment. Again. like my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin), I intend to speak purely on my own account and will not necessarily reflect the views of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I felt, bearing in mind my own association in the past with the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs. that I should like to pay due tribute to it for the tremendous part that it has played over many years regarding proficiency testing in agriculture. My own experience lies with the Executive Committee of the Warwickshire Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs, and I was delighted to see on reading the 1974-75 annual report of the National Proficiency Tests Council for Agriculture and Horticulture that there was a photograph on page 6 of Her Royal Highness. Princess Anne, presenting the farm craft gold badge to John Hutchings, who is chairman of the Warwickshire Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sat on the Executive Committee of that Federation for some five years and was most impressed with its dedication to improving qualification and knowledge within farming and the tremendous amount of work that it did regarding proficiency testing. That Federation was fortunate to have as its leader within the county Major John Wilson, who brought great determination and knowledge to his work. Therefore, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
this not unfriendly debate, will refer to the valuable contribution made by the Young Farmers' Clubs in proficiency testing in agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already expressed my own personal views on the merits of these tests, and I do not think that there is any need to go much further into them. However, there are a number of matters which arise in considering the future of proficiency testing. I make no apology for bringing the Committee back to the report submitted to the Minister by the City and Guilds of London Institute in February 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the spending of money, the Minister of State said this on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The National Proficiency Tests Council, which devises the tests, has found it impossible to survive without a modest measure of Government support."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1273.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore. as a consequence we are to spend a certain amount of public money on the National Proficiency Tests Council. Although it may not be a corporate body, that is where the cash is going. and we ought to know how it is to be organised in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 61 on page 19 of the City and Guilds of London Institute's report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consideration should also be given to the possibilities of establishing the NPTC either as an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food."</p></blockquote>
I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he did not think that was a good thing, because neither do I,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of the Agricultural Training Board."</p></blockquote>
In view of the history of that organisation. I cannot say that I am too overjoyed about burdening it with additional duties as is now climbing out of the trough into which it fell in the early clays of its activities. Speaking for myself I am glad that the Agricultural Training Board is restoring its prestige and power after those extremely difficult and turbulent days in its early stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other possibility, to which I referred. is incorporating the NPTC in a body proposed in the report of the Joint Advisory Committee on Agricultural Education in 1973. It is important at this stage for the Minister when he replies to tell us how he sees the role of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
NPTC in the future. As I have said, we are spending money on it and we ought to know what the Minister has in store.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is one to which I refered briefly at the end of the debate on Amendment No. 71. The summary of the City and Guilds of London Institute's report on page 25 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having considered the costs of the present system a revised means of financing proficiency testing in the future is proposed based entirely on fee income."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>Since the tests are intended to serve the interests of employers and employees in the industry each party should be expected to contribute to financing them.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is recommended that any candidate who has followed an approved form of preparation in order to take the tests should pay part of the fee, and the remainder of each fee should be Provided by the Agricultural Training Board."</p></blockquote>

That was recommended to the Government in February 1975. Why have they since changed their attitude? Why are they proposing to pay these grants? I know that inflation has happened. I personally subscribe to the philosophy thaf was laid down in the City and Guilds of London Report. But the Government seem to have moved away from that point of view and we have not yet had an explanation. The Minister spoke about the proposition of putting a financial ceiling on Government grant, which I applaud. But he did not get down to the fundamental point of why the Government are paying anything in view of the exactly contrary recommendation which they had a short time ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. It is confusing when all three hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench intersperse their remarks with statements to the effect that "I am speaking for myself". It makes it difficult, particularly when the deputy spokesman for agriculture tells the Committee at various points that he is speaking for himself. I shall try to unravel when he was speaking for himself and when he was speaking for the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I appeared to do that. If I said that I was speaking for myself, it was through some form
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
of modesty, but I hope the Committee will take it that, of all things, I can say that I was speaking in the capacity that I enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am grateful for rasurance. However, it does not alter the fact that all three hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench speak with different voices, although I am happy to recognise the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) in his official capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-superMare (Mr. Wiggin) put a point of view which could be called the Selsdon viewpoint with regard to the work being done by the NPTC. I should not want to be drawn into the arguments for craft premia. I am sure that would be ruled out with the scope of this debate. But I would respond in this regard. Many farm workers receive above the agricultural wage minimum, but it is not the case to say that no one gets the minimum wage. Clearly, they are earning above the minimum wage, but the minimum wage is a rate relating to so many hours' work. It is not the case in England that hardly any farm workers are on the minimum rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Grant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is crucial and will come into our debates on other matters. Does the Minister possess figures on this and, if the appropriate Parliamentary Questions were to be tabled, would it be possible to elicit from him detailed information about this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman of that. My hon. Friend the Member for Morpeth (Mr. Grant) pointed out that I refer to England, but what I say also applies to Scotland. It is just that the Bill applies basically to England and Wales, but not Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reject, therefore, arguments by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare purporting to describe the NPTC as an undesirable bureaucracy. My goodness, if that very small body run by a group of distinguished people in the industry, with a handful of fulltime people, doing the job it is doing, is an undesirable bureaucracy we shall not have many
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
civil servants or Government activity left, if the hon. Gentleman gets his way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it is not true to suggest that somehow the NPTC came into being in response to the Agricultural Wages Board's decision to have craft premia. The AWB is an independent body which took a decision to have craft premia quite independently. The NPTC tests were there, and it decided to use them for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the work of the Federation of Young Farmers Clubs, I am happy to assure the hon. Member for Masclesfield [wintcrton) thatin my opinion, it did a very valuable job. It was right and proper that the tests should be taken over by a body more representative of the industry, and the NPTC has the full support of the Young Farmers Clubs, of the National Farmers' Union, and of the whole industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I e that the Minister will note that again I refer to the annual report for 1974–75 and the counties with which I have had some interest. I was born in Staffordshire. The number of tests taken there last year was one of the highest amongst all the counties. I was on the executive committee in Warwickshire, which is also at the top of the league, and my adoptive county, Cheshire, has also done a remarkably good job. I hope that the Minister will express individual thanks to these three counties. That is, of course, a constituency point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the remarks of the hon. Member for Westmorland. I welcome the fact that he has dissociated himself from some of the remarks of the Opposition benches to the effect that the NPTC should be wound up and that it is not making an important contribution to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the Government's attitude to this report. Far be it for me to suggest that the work carried out by this body is not useful. The hon. Gentleman has referred to it at considerable length and it brings out the contribution the NPTC is making and the need for that job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the bulk of the industry, and the Government, have been unable to accept the basic recommendations of the report. We are unable to accept the two recom-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
mendations to which my hon. Friend referred, and which he himself indicated he would not want us to take on board. Unlike him, we are unable to accept the suggestion that this body should receive no public funds whatsoever, and that it should be made entirely self-financing. We believe that what has been built up is viable, that it has the good will of industry, and that for us to cut off these funds would be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A relatively small sum of money is involved, and we should keep the matter in perspective. Yesterday we discussed the payment of grants to encourage farmers to cease production. I should have thought that, in principle, most of us are happier about public money being used to encourage workers to acquire skills and efficiency, or to encourage production, than about its being used to encourage people to move out of production. If hon. Members opposite ever have occasion to come to power this century I hope that they will carefully consider where the axe falls when they implement these wide and apparently ruthless cuts in public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stray out of order, but the hon. Gentleman referred to what we debated yesterday and tried to put that together with this debate. Surely he would agree that in yesterday morning's debate on apple and pear orchard grubbing grants the purpose of the Government's policy was to create a larger, more viable apple and pear industry, to get rid of the worst elements, and to encourage the better elements. As we produce only about half our apples and pears and import the rest, surely the purpose yesterday was to improve the standard of the British apple and pear industry so that we receive a bigger share of our own market and more people can work in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I thought the hon. Gentleman was present yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That scheme was introduced by the Conservative Government to facilitate the exodus of apple and pear growers from our industry so that we could take more produce from the Continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Of course it is true. If
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
one reads the Press statement made by the Minister of Agriculture—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is unusual to have to call a Minister to order. This is nothing to do with the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very fair. I am sorry to have departed from the clause. We believe that this is money well spent and that the loss of good will which would occur in the industry, if we were to cut off this money, would be unacceptable and we should be undoing and setting back the valuable activities of the National Proficiency Tests Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland asked me how we saw things developing in the future. We see the NPTC continuing as an independent body. We see it developing closer co-ordination between the county committees. We see it continuing with its present work but doing it better, improving the tests, seeing that they are even more relevant to the needs of the industry and making its contribution to encouraging our work force to acquire the skills it needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be quite clear about this. If we are to have improvement in efficiency in the industry and secure increased production with a small labour force acquiring the skills and techniques with which the NPTC is concerned, we must help these workers, particularly new workers coming into the industry, to achieve maximum productivity and to contribute to this important, valuable and viable industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that by and large hon. Members support the work of the NPTC and are happy to see them continue to receive public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joplin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am not totally convinced of why the Government have not taken up the recommendations on financial matters which were made to them and to which I drew attention. If the Parliamentary Secretary had not during the debate on Amendment No. 7I agreed that he would go away and think seriously about putting a financial ceiling on this, my inclination would have been to ask the Committee whether we really wanted to sign a blank cheque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of the recommendations that the Parliamentary Secretary made and the undertaking he gave, I am inclined, not to oppose the clause, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
To wait to see what he produces on Report. At that time if we think that he has not put in adequate safeguards about the size of the financial contribution we should be inclined to take a different line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>MEASURES TO RESTRICT THE GROWING MALE HOP OF PLANTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 24, in page 5, line 29, after "area" insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of less than 9 square miles".</p></blockquote>
We are now moving into perhaps a more controversial area, and it may test the new spirit which is abroad in the Committee. The clause creates a new crime. It will be a crime for hop growers to grow the male hop. Not everyone on this side of the Committee supports what has been called the Selsdon argument. I re-read with regret the Second Reading debate and the contributions of some of my hon. Friends on the subject of hops. My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Joplin,) recognised the need for "ministerial muscle" if we were to bring to an end the male hop, and muscle we are introducing. We are giving the Minister considerable muscle over hop growers. Although I recognise that my hon. Friend advanced some convincing arguments, I regretted a little that he should be supporting such a high degree of ministerial muscle. The fashion now of Front Benches is to support an extension of muscle, and Shadows can be almost as strong in support of it as their counterparts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is intended to limit the power of the Minister in what is alleged to be an experiment. The Minister made it plain that it was intended to be an experiment. Therefore, I hope the Minister can reassure hop growers that this is still the intention. I say that because the Hops Marketing Board seems to have a different idea. I have a statement, which I understand comes from the Board,
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
alleging that the amendment seeking to limit the associated areas to nine square miles
	<br><blockquote><p>"appears to be based on the erroneous concept that we are still working on an experimental basis."</p></blockquote>
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will make it clear whether we are still talking in terms of an experiment, or whether he or the Hops Marketing Board have in mind something far beyond experiment. A feeling has been expressed by hop growers that the Hops Marketing Board is determined to eliminate entirely the male hop being grown in this country. There may be good arguments for it. We should be keeping in line with not just the rest of Europe but also the rest of the world, because as I understand it we are alone now in still growing the male hop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not an unimportant consideration for people who like to drink the beer that their fathers and grandfathers drank rather than the beer that Mr. Watney or Mr. Whitbread may think good for them because it is the cheapest kind of beer to produce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have learnt their lesson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of them have learnt their lesson, although one regrets that we are not to have that lesson wholly applied in the House, as I understand it from a recent statement made on behalf of the Catering Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to give some reassurance to hop growers that this is an experiment which will be limited to a certain area of the United Kingdom. Perhaps I made a mistake by inserting "9 square miles" into the amendment: perhaps it should have been some other figure. Perhaps it should be a metric figure, as the Bill is concerned with introducing metrication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have a number of hectares inserted, so be it, but there should be some limit to this experiment. As I understand the Bill, the Minister may make an order forbidding the growing of male hops throughout the whole country without coming back to the House for further authority. Perhaps the Minister will contradict that if I have made a mistake, because hop growers fear that this is their last opportunity of making representations to the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
about this measure, which is not necessarily to the advantage of hop growers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be said that it is to the advantage of other interests. Perhaps hon. Members on the Government benches will understand exactly what I am talking about and have some sympathy with the amendment, and therefore some regard for consumers of beer. I realise that hop growers have been consulted about this, but I repeat the fears that have been expressed by many of them, particularly in Kent. Anxiety is felt that the Bill will give power to the Minister to make the whole of the United Kingdom the area where male hops can no longer be grown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head. Perhaps he would explain, because the view that I have just expressed has been put to me by the hop growers and was expressed on Second Reading by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch). The Minister will remember that during that debate my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Hamilton), who is a member of the Hops Marketing Board, intervened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should like to reassure my hon. Friend. The Minister has my entire support on Clause 5, and this is a matter in which I have an interest. The experiments are limited to isolated areas within Hampshire. Regulations of this type are already in existence in, for example, Germany and Belgium. I do not think my hon. Friend need lie awake too much at night about them."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, c. 1333.]</p></blockquote>
These are the words of an hon. Member whom we all respect and know, who spoke with the authority of a member of the Hops Marketing Board, who is familiar with that area of Hampshire, and who said that these experiments are limited to one area. He went on to say to his colleagues who represent hop growing areas, "Do not worry about what is going on. It is perfectly all right. The experiments apply only to a restricted area of Hampshire".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the inference that I draw from that intervention. If that is the proper inference to draw surely the Minister will consider accepting the amendment, because all that the amendment seeks to do is to put into legislative effect the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury who was, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
the Minister, appreciates supporting the Minister on Clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will, therefore, make clear, first, whether it is an experiment; I have already quoted the Hops Marketing Board on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if it is an experiment, then ought it not remain an experiment within a certain limited area, such as nine square miles? If it needs to be snore, so be it. Perhaps it could be limited to one county, if that is a more convenient measurement. Should not such an experiment be limited to one particular area? That should be set out in the Bill because, if not, the Bill gives the Minister power, by a series of orders, to include the whole United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee for me to intervene at this stage. I am pleased that we are speeding up at a time when Concorde is on the way back from its first commercial flight. I am proud to be wearing my Concorde tie as one of the Agriculture Ministers who flew in Concorde, I did that a few years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's service has not been as good as that on Concorde yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the inventiveness and pioneering that produced Concorde is also to be found in the agricultural industry, and the purpose of the Bill is to assist the industry in its task of keeping ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it might be helpful to intervene now as the hon. Gentleman does not seem too clear about the purpose of the clause. It may, therefore, be of assistance if I briefly outline what the clause seeks to do, and try to give the hon. Gentleman some assurances that we are not trying to discriminate against the male hop. That will become known as we continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I object to the term "male hops".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we do not get into sexes and sevens on this clause.

interests of the industry—I refer, of course, to pollination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be to set a limit to the extent of an area designated for the purpose of growing seedless hops. This may be an attempt to improve the position of the individual growers who do not wish to grow seedless hops when neighbouring growers do so. The effect of the amendment would be to limit arbitrarily the size of each area designated for the production of seedless hops. Such areas cannot be limited artificially in this way. The size and shape of the area must depend on 	<i>a</i> variety of factors; the size and disposition of the hop gardens which seek to
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
grow seedless hops, physical barriers, such as hills, and the direction of the prevailing wind on which the pollen may be carried are factors which must be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drawing up such areas a measure of flexibility is essential so that areas may be defined sympathetically with due regard to the nature of the area and the wishes of the individual growers, both within and outside that area—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
