<p><i>Amendment (c) proposed to the proposed new clause</i>—[<i>25th March</i>]—in line 75, leave out paragraph (<i>f</i>)—[<i>Mr. Roderick.</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister is here today because this debate is perhaps the most crucial in this series of discussions on the new clauses. I know that the Minister will have been following our debates and will be aware of the strength of mood on the Government side of the Committee that we must get the measure right.<br><br>
The proposal that there should be a restriction to two transfers on two successions only lies at the heart of the discussion. The principle has been accepted and the clauses attempt to set out the method by which the principle will be implemented. The principle is based on two considerations.<br><br>
The first is that a great deal of hardship or injustice would occur following the death or injury of the tenant farmer. Those who have been involved with him and are close to him in the working of the holding would be deprived of a continuing interest in the holding.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the recognition that farming, unlike many other occupations, requires a continuation of involvement among those who have been involved in the holding in the interests of forward planning and good husbandry. It is because we recognise that farming is not a 12-monthly affair, but is a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-year affair, that we recognise the importance of that provision. It gives an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
interest and involvement in the future among the people who are most closely connected with the holding. It is not just the tenant himself who must put all his energies and forethought into taking in new land and acquiring more capital machinery, but those who continue to farm that holding who also have the same interests. Without that continuing interest, good husbandry will disappear. We face the twin problems of hardship and injustice and the interests of good farming.<br><br>
It has been argued that good farming depends upon the landlord/tenant relationship, and a good deal of it does. It also depends upon the people who are doing the job and their confidence that they can continue to do it. That lies at the heart of the argument about the succession. We are not talking about two generations. Of itself two generations would not solve the problem of long-term forward thinking and forward planning, because two generations could be as short as a year or as long as 50 years. We are talking of two transfers.<br><br>
There is a total illogicality written in to the proposals. I cannot understand the reason for the two successions being written in, and I find it difficult to deal rationally and logically with that proposition. It is outside the perimeter of any logical thinking. It has been suggested that landlords would be reluctant to allow fresh letting if they knew that this system could apply in perpetuity. The NFU thinks that the only possible reason for the proposal might be to encourage the landlord to continue to let. With respect, the arguments that have been advanced make nonsense even of that brave attempt by the NFU to try to find the reason.<br><br>
The two transfers might apply over a short period, but the period could be as long as 70 or 80 years. It is inconceivable that a landlord who would be willing to allow a new let would see any difference between the concepts of long-term, in perpetuity or 50, 70 or 80 years. In other words, the argument that the system would prevent the letting of new farms is not solved by bringing in the two transfers because the length of time that could be involved is just as long as the concept of in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right in logic, but did not the same problem arise with the Rent Acts, and were not two successions agreed there?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0543">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 987</span>
If this proposal is wrong, that must also be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has heard only half the case. I said that there were two arguments. One concerns injustice or hardship, and that applies also to housing. The other is the question of good farming and long-term concepts of husbandry, and that has no analogy with housing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is introducing a new line of argu ment. The Government's argument s that hardship can be created if the succession is not right, after an appeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. That has nothing to do with good husbandry or the length of time involved. It is wrong for the hon. Gentleman to introduce a brand new principle which the Government have never supported.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I gave way. I wish the hon. Gentleman would catch up with our discussions. His intervention was irrelevant.<br><br>
The principle of the two successions does not encourage a landlord to introduce a new let. It makes no difference to the landlord's inclination either to let or not to let.<br><br>
If we say that to deal with hardship or injustice we should allow the continuation of a tenancy to a near relative, again, the principle of two successions does not make logical sense. Hardships are always future hardship, not present hardships. A hardship or injustice does not face Mr. Smith now, because by definition Mr. Smith has not yet died. This provision comes into operation only after death or retirement. It does not deal with existing hardship. By definition it can deal only with a future injustice or hardship.<br><br>
The only way to deal with an existing hardship is by retrospective legislation, but we are not dealing with retrospective legislation, so we are not dealing with present injustice or hardship. By definition the Bill can deal only with a future case of hardship that occurs after the Bill becomes law.<br><br>
We are in a curious logical impasse. We say that we shall deal with injustice only if it occurs on two occasions, but the law has to deal with injustices and hardship in general and not just with two hypothetical cases. Our laws do not pro
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 988</span>
vide that there shall be a widow's pension not for existing widows but for any first widow in the future and for no more widows after that. By definition, we pass laws to deal with all cases of hardship and injury.<br><br>
The logic of the restriction to two tenancies and the possibility of allowing new tenancies to occur is invalid. The argument put forward to deal with existing hardship and injustice is invalid because it is concerned only with future cases. To say that we shall deal only with two successions in future is illogical because, by definition, law which deals with hardship and injury must encompass all hardship and injuries that occur in future. That makes nonsense of the introduction of this principle.<br><br>
I want to deal with the effects that have been predicted by Opposition Members. I am dealing here with the principle and not with the two successions. At the end of the last Sitting I was dealing with what the Scottish NFU says. The Scottish experience is important because within living memory we have had an example of both systems, where security of tenancy existed and where it did not exist. The Scottish NFU says:
<br><blockquote><p>"While it could be argued that, if this were done,"</p></blockquote>
—that is, if we did away with security of tenure in succession—
<br><blockquote><p>"more farms would become available for lelting, the period between 1958 and 1968—during which the tenants' rights of succession were severely restricted—showed no appreciable increase in the number of farms offered as tenancies."</p></blockquote>
The one valid experience we have to draw on shows that the argument of not wanting to discourage letting does not apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>M. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a stupid argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr, Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not an argument, it is a piece of experience.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The period was short. Political risk was evident throughout the period. Of course there would not be any change over those few years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to suggest tht within the 10 years people who wished to let their farms or to hang on to them were influenced by the thought that in future the position might change. The argument would have to be that they expected such a change in the future and, therefore, they were either holed up or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0544">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 989</span>
not holed up, but no appreciable change occurred. They did not react to either political assumption. The system had no appreciable effect either way. The argument is invalid.<br><br>
The way to deal with this is to introduce something like the Danish method and ensure that lettings occur rather than wholesale purchasing or institution buying. I do not deeply grieve over point 5 made by the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs, which is:
<br><blockquote><p>"The future of the small estate owner, who may only possess two or three farms, must be considered more deeply."</p></blockquote>
With respect, the position of the tenant of one of those two or three farms must also be considered deeply, in addition to the hardship affecting small estate owners who may only possess two or three farms. We are making a bridge in the basic application of law in this country. We have accepted that in Britain, where Parliament is sovereign and where we operate without a written constitution, the method of dealing with the future is to pass laws on the basis of what we can understand at present and predict in the future. If these laws go wrong, we change them.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The NFU suggests that we may get some experience within the two successions. If that is so, it is envisaging the possibility of changing the law. This is exactly what one must do. It strikes at the heart of the normal constitutional position in Britain to say that we will pass a law which will come to an end regardless whether the conditions that devise that law will prevail. If the law sets off an unfortunate 'train of events, we pass a new law. That is what we mean by saying that no Parliament binds its successor. But this is an attempt to bind a successor.<br><br>
For all these reasons, the Minister must reconsider this matter. I do not know why it was introduced. I cannot begin to grapple with the thought processes that gave rise to it. I understand that compromise is an essential part of political life. It may be the NFU thought that, having got the principle accepted, we may be able to go forward on that basis. The point about compromise is to try to get universality of acceptance, but there has been no acceptance of the principle on behalf of the Country
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 990</span>
Landowners' Association. The Association does not accept it. I do not see how the compromise applies here. If it was saying, "Let us see if this helps the relationships between tenant and landlord," there might be some justification for it. But there is no argument on that. Instead of being a compromise, it is a surrender of principle. I hope the Minister will deal with that point. I hope he will take his courage in both hands and will recognise that this is a grievous mistake. It cffends me for agricultural reasons. I hope the Minister will say the Government have made an error and will wipe out this restriction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Fred Peart)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought some other hon. Members would like to join in the debate. If not, I hope this is a winding up speech and that we can come to a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are glad to see the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Member will appreciate I was not absent doing nothing. I was in Cabinet or in Europe. It is the tradition of the House, and has always been so, that a Minister may be absent in this way. We are here concerned with the most important part of this Bill.<br><br>
One of the points that we had to consider was whether the scheme should operate for an indefinite period or on a limited number of occasions. Admittedly—and I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said—a precedent already existed in the Scottish legislation where there is no limit to the number of transfers. But, with a 10-year break, the Scottish scheme has been running in one form or another since 1949, and the 1949 scheme reflected a concept in Scottish law which had existed for many years, that a heritable right transmits on succession.<br><br>
We, on the other hand, would be introducing a scheme for family succession of tenancies for the very first time and my colleagues and I felt that to go straight from no inheritance to inheritance in perpetuity would be too extreme a course to recommend to the House. My hon. Friend talked about compromise being an essential part of political life. I accept that. He is an old political
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 991</span>
campaigner and a distinguished hon. Member and he knows that is true. Therefore, I think he will appreciate what I have done. It would deprive the landlord of any assurance that he would ever be able to regain possession of his own land.<br><br>
We felt that such an arrangement would be likely to cause serious damage to the landlord—tenant system and prove a severe disincentive to the letting of farms. I have always stressed that the system has worked well. Whatever the arguments about land nationalisation, that is another matter. We should not damage the landlord—tenant system. I gave a pledge in this Committee and on the Floor of the House in this direction. In the interests of maintaining a healthy and efficient agriculture industry, it would clearly be imprudent to adopt this course.<br><br>
At the other end of the scale—and here I am touching on the amendments of the hon. Members opposite even though they have so far declined to move them—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that in any critical spirit. They will be moved and there will be argument about them. So far they have not been moved. I understand the reasons.<br><br>
We felt that to limit the operation of the scheme which we had in mind to one single occasion would deprive it of much of its practical effectiveness and would be unnecessarily restrictive. It was clear to us therefore that we needed a middle course—there is nothing wrong in that and we looked for precedents about which the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) asked last Thursday. An up-to-date precedent is tenancies of dwellings under the Rent Acts—and here I agree with the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon). These Acts allow a tenancy to pass twice on the death of a tenant before the property reverts to the landlord. They do not cover quite the same situation as the one that we would be legislating for, but there is sufficient similarity in the desire to avoid hardship and to keep the family in their home to justify adopting a similar course.<br><br>
We therefore decided to provide that the right to family succession may operate on not more than two successive occa
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 992</span>
sions. This will meet the case where on the death of a tenant he is succeeded by a son who, in the fullness of time, dies and is in turn succeeded by his own son, that is to say, by a grandson of the original tenant. That is by way of illustration, although I think it fair to describe it as the normal sequence of succession.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has already told the Committee that the up-to-date figure for the average length of tenancy is between 30 and 40 years, so that a considerable degree of family continuity will be provided under our proposals.<br><br>
I should like now to deal with various points which were made in the debate last Thursday. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) pointed out that where the tenancy passes from tenant to brother we will not be providing for succession for anything like 30 to 40 years. This may be so, but the normal run of family successions is father-son-grandson, and transfers from father to brother or sister must be in the minority of cases. Clearly where a family has two courses open to them—by which I mean to decide whether the tenant's brother or son may apply for the tenancy—they may be faced with a difficult decision. It is important therefore that if tenant farmers have views on their successors they should set them down clearly in their wills. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) stated that the NFU asked me to provide for only one succession. That is not correct. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West, has already read out the relevant extract from its circular to hon. Members.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Phipps) pointed out that a particular hardship might arise where the father dies before the son has had time to put in five years' work on the holding even though he always intended to follow his father. This is in line with the other comments that have been made about the eligibility requirement in subsection (3)(b). It is becoming clear that this eligibility rule is too inflexible and may become a legal ban to applications when in fact it is mainly intended as a guide.<br><br>
The answer is probably to introduce a discretionary power if we can do so without departing from the essential link with the holding and leave the matter to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0546">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 993</span>
good sense of the ALT to determine when considering an applicant's agricultural training and experience. We are already looking into this.<br><br>
Finally, I have set out the reasons for the two succession rule in detail. I cannot pretend that it was an easy decision and there are differences of view as to exactly how long a period we are legislating for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just touched on a very important point. He feels greater discretion should be given to the ALT. Does he mean that within the context of the eligible persons already quoted in the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one factor. I should like to look at this again. I will take note of what the hon. Member has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Staunton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought the Minister was particularising his remarks about agricultural training.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be one factor. I will look at this and, if necessary, inform the Committee. I would like time to consider this. Hon. Members have made a very important point and I have taken note of it. Indeed, I came to this Committee armed because I knew this has been raised previously.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor has said that in some cases two successions may take place in only a handful of years, while the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has pointed out that he is the third generation of his family to occupy his farm, so it has already been in his family for 80 years. Both examples are probably the extreme end of the scale. So I stick to my theme that in the normal run of successions we are providing that one family can continue as tenants of their holding for the lifetime of the present occupier and two further generations. In other words, we are legislating for a substantial period of years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr Phipps</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is surely the abnormal period of succession about which we are concerned. We all accept that it is 30 to 40 years on average. What happens when it may be one or two years? We are assuming that everybody will have a son.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good assumption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Phipps</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the exceptional cases we are concerned about.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 994</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I have only one son. What I am saying is that we may be thinking about the daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about hardship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member. I was asked to look at this. I have come to this decision, but I am prepared to look again at matters which can be properly referred to the ALT. We are legislating for a substantial number of years. It is not for too short a period so that our legislation is only a short-term measure, it is not for so long a period that we shall be depriving landowners of their own holdings. This is all a question of balance, and I think that we have achieved the right balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall be depriving landowners for 100 years or so.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the balance is right. Opposition hon. Members can take their own line. I think that what I am doing will have the approval of the farmers' unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it will!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be a good thing. We must bear in mind the importance of the working farmer. I am not arguing against the landlord. I want the landlord—tenant relationship to be preserved in the best sense. As I say, I believe that we have found the right balance. We are introducing an important change in the laws applying to tenanted holdings. For that reason, I stand firm. I hope that we shall be able to come to a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, we are glad to see the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with us this morning. I hope he will agree that we have been reasonably patient. We understand that he has duties elsewhere. Although we have been patient, I hope he will understand that we have been making certain noises in the hope that he would be able to attend our proceedings. For those reasons, we are glad to see him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is exercising reasonable patience. I hope he will understand that I have not attended the Committee because I have been in Cabinet or in Europe. When I was a Shadow Minister, I always insisted that a Minister's first priority must

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 995</span>
be the Cabinet. That has always been accepted. I hope that I have not been disrespectful to the Committee in any way. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that he has exercised reasonable patience. I hope he continues to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for being grateful to me. We seem to be going round in an ever-diminishing circle.<br><br>
We have been particularly keen that the Minister should attend our proceedings at this stage. We have felt that the Government have occupied a shifting position in their attitude towards the new clauses. We have been somewhat disturbed to hear some of the speeches and some of the Government's changes of heart which the right hon. Gentleman's ministerial colleagues have been propounding since we started to consider the new clauses dealing with the succession of tenancies. To some extent, the Minister's speech has further confused the issue.<br><br>
The Minister's remarks about Amendment (<i>c</i>) are acceptable to us. We feel that it would be totally wrong to accept the amendment which was moved by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) last Thursday.<br><br>
The latter part of the Minister's remarks disturbed me. The right hon. Gentleman said that the Government are having further thoughts about these matters. He seemed to imply that there will be Government amendments to the Government's proposals that will be introduced on Report or in another place. It seems that there will be amendments to deal with some of the so-called anomalies. The right hon. Gentleman referred to instances in which the tenant dies unexpectedly before the son has been able to get in the required period of work. That puts us in a difficult situation.<br><br>
The amendments that the Government accepted last week imply that they have now changed their view. If the son—I use the word "son" as a shorthand term as I know that it covers a much wider spread of people—goes to university or some academy of higher education, he does not now have to read agriculture. That means that if he goes to university and spends three years reading Arabic studies, for example, and a further two years going round the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 996</span>
world, he can choose to spend only two of the seven qualifying years on the holding or in devoting himself to agriculture.<br><br>
The Government have departed from their original proposal that five of the seven years must be devoted to agriculture, either working on the holding or studying at an academic institution. The Government have turned that proposal upside down. But, having made that change, the Minister is now saying that if at the end of one year the father dies the young man might still be able to inherit the tenancy. If after leaving school a young man spends three years reading Arabic studies or archeology at university, and another two years travelling round the world or working in another occupation, working for only one year on the farm, it seems that he will be able to go to the tribunal and obtain the tenancy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must remember that this is not a "clause stand part" debate. We are discussing a narrow amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was tempted to go along those paths Mr. Costain, because the Minister gave us warning that the Government are thinking of extending the provisions of the clause. I was tempted along these avenues by the Minister's speech. I think that I have made my point.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will understand that we are disturbed by the shifting ground on which the Government seem to stand. The Minister has repeated his pledge that he is prepared to do anything to avoid damaging the landlord—tenant system. We believe passionately that the measures contained in the new clauses will damage that relationship. We realise that we are in disagreement on that issue, but we firmly believe that time will prove us right.<br><br>
We support what the Minister has said in rejecting the amendment, but we have other amendments on similar matters which I hope he will not reject. I think he will find that some of them have a good deal of importance and appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Phipps</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what my right hon. Friend has said about subsection (3)(b), which greatly helps to give powers of discretion to the tribunal which will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 997</span>
help to produce more flexibility. However, I address myself specifically to the amendment, which seeks to delete paragraph (<i>f</i>). It is important to appreciate the difficulty which my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) seeks to put before the Committee. There can be fairly rapid successions. One example which the Committee should consider is when there is a son of minority age. When the father died, it might be seen to be expedient, to keep the holding, for the tenancy to pass to the mother for one succession and to be passed to the son in another. There are also tenant holders who do not have sons or daughters whose tenancies pass to sister or brother.<br><br>
I suggest that we could introduce a degree of flexibility by reconsidering paragraph (f). If we are to try to produce a period of time that is satisfactory for both landlord and tenant, the easiest thing would be to provide for two successions or a period of years. Let us provide for a shorter period than the average two tenancies in which succession could pass. It could automatically fall after the third or fourth succession, or within 30 years when the tenant had died or given up the tenancy.<br><br>
My suggestion in no way breaches the principle that my right hon. Friend puts forward. I suggest that a reasonable period be provided for tenant and landlord that allows for the passage of the tenancy on more than two occasions within, for example, 30 years. At the expiry of the 30 years, or when he died, the tenant would give up the tenancy and the property would revert to the landlord.<br><br>
I believe that that suggestion is within the spirit of my right hon. Friend's suggestion and overcomes the difficulties raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously trying to cover the unfortunate eventuality of the premature death of the tenant. Perhaps he will carry the argument forward and argue that we alleviate the hardship that is caused by the premature death of a landowner, which often means that capital transfer tax is paid twice within five years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Phipps</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be glad to expand my argument, but to do so would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 998</span>
not be completely within the terms of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for resisting the temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But my point is relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Phipps</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of producing a series of inflexible requirements which will create the very thing that we are trying to avoid, namely, hardship and injustice. I feel that may suggestion meets my right hon. Friend's point and overcomes the difficulties raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor. I hope that the clause will be withdrawn and that my right hon. Friend will reconsider the matter and return with a clause which provides for the elements that I am recommending.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must express my out-rage at the amendments and my only slightly less considerable disturbance about paragraph (<i>f</i>). I believe that it will lead to considerable ossification.<br><br>
I followed the tenor of the Minister's argument, but I am afraid that we are playing with a quantity that is totally unascertainable at this stage. My great fear is that these provisions will be highly detrimental to tenancies of the type and size of those in East Anglia. I appreciate that there is a difference between the East Anglian tenancies and those in the West Country and in Wales.<br><br>
To answer the case made by the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps), I believe that the enactment of these measures will create what has been termed insurable interests. I have no doubt that the insurance industry would quickly get busy. Given the charter of succession which would be embodied, insurable interests will almost certainly be created.<br><br>
My question to the Minister relates to the wording of paragraph (<i>f</i>). The paragraph reads on from the preamble, and when joined reads as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"The following sections of this Part of this Act shall not apply if they applied on each of the last two occasions …"</p></blockquote>
What is the meaning of the word" applied"? Does it mean if they were activated, or merely if they were applicable? A feature that emerges from the new clauses is the absence of voluntary agreements but the ability to arrive at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0549">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 999</span>
voluntary agreements and to abdicate any rights hereunder, or to embrace them within expressly voluntary agreements.<br><br>
If that situation is achieved it could be that "applied" should be interpreted in terms of not activating by passage to the Agricultural Lands Tribunal, although the ultimate is achieved in terms of a written agreement between landlord and tenant, thereby making express reference to the provisions of this measure. It is most important that we should be informed about the meaning of the word " applied".<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The Minister skated very rapidly over the provisions of the Rent Acts and tried to draw various parallels. He did not allow himself to be pressed too far. There are two successions in terms of a close relative. But where the widow survives there is only one succession unless in the peculiar circumstances of Section 3 and Schedule 1 of the Rent Act 1968 that widow re-marries and another widow survives. This parallel falls down because paragraph (f) relates not to widows but to sons of sons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister has reiterated that the average length of tenancies seems to be about 30 to 40 years. That would mean by the two-transfer provisions that the average length of the safeguards under this paragraph would be about 70 years. If, as Conservative Members have claimed, removing the paragraph would create a disincentive, I would claim that a 70-year term is sufficient disincentive for landlords to let farms at all. We do not need to remove the paragraph to provide a disincentive. My right hon. Friend said that the majority of transfers would come under the two-transfer system—such as by husband to wife, brother to brother, and so on. In its brief the NFU said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Union therefore accepts that limitation, since it will still overcome existing hardship cases, and give ample opportunity to study how the scheme operates in practice."</p></blockquote>
If our contention is borne out that the whole thing could be over in a very short period, there would be no experience of the arrangement.<br><br>
There is some merit in offering either the two-transfer system or the attachment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1000</span>
of a time scale. My right hon. Friend wants greater discretion given to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. Does that mean great discretion and flexibility within the two-transfer system, or outside it? Does my right hon. Friend want to retain the paragraph and then give the tribunal discretion to act outside the two-transfer system? In that case, we could abolish the two-transfer system altogether.<br><br>
I should like my right hon. Friend to look again at this paragraph in view of what has been said. Perhaps he could take a long cool look at it and come back on Report. If he could agree to that, I should be happy to withdraw the amendment, but failing that I feel I must press it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ruchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite know what to say because the debate has not been answered. My right hon. Friend talked about getting the right balance and said that two was the right balance. I should like to know on what basis he says that. We agree that the amount of time involved could be from one year to 70 or 80 years, so he is not talking about a balance of time. Is he therefore talking about a balance between the interests of the landlord and of the tenant? The interest of the landlord is to sell the holding, occupy it or let it. The interest of the tenant is to be certain that the succession will take place. I cannot see that there is a balance of interest where the owner might want to sell and the tenant and his family want to secure the tenancy. The question of balance does not arise with the good landlord because he is willing to let the holding.<br><br>
In view of what I said, therefore, there is no balance of time and no balance of interest, so what is the balance we are talking about? The only balance I can see is that the NFU might at least say that the scheme should be started and that we could see where we went from there, but that of itself is a total illogicality.<br><br>
On the question of time I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) that the problem might be overcome by raising the time scale. I welcome that, but that does not deal with the problem of hardship that we are legislating to deal with. It is pointless to say that we will disregard any hardship in 50 years' time.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0550">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1001</span>
The analogy with the five-year tax provision was raised in which it was suggested that the two transfers should take place within that term. It is worth bearing in mind here that the Lands Tribunal considers the whole question of hardship, but that by definition under the capital transfer tax a specific hardship of that kind does not arise. If my right hon. Friend the Minister favours the two-transfer system, may I suggest that he supports the election of my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) to succeed to the leadership of the Labour Party for the next two transfers of power. That would be an exact analogy. We would not elect my right hon. Friend in perpetuity, but just for the next two transfers of power. I hope that my right hon. Friend will respond to that. It would be a very good balance both for the party and the country.<br><br>
This whole provision is shot through with illogicality. It is a nonsense and it does no credit to the Government to introduce it merely to assuage the fears of the Country Landowners' Association. The Minister must say that either he believes in the principle or he does not, and if he believes in it he must delete the paragraph.<br><br>
There is one further reason why he should do so. I welcome his attempt to reconsider some aspects of the matter. In that case, surely it should be left to the Lands Tribunal which has the function to exercise discretion. In other words, my right hon. Friend should delete the paragraph and leave future succession in the hands of the Lands Tribunal, which would decide the balance of hardship in each case.<br><br>
I hope that my right hon. Friend will respond to the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West about the alternative timing. I do not think the suggestion is any better in principle than what we already have, but it might be better in practice. I hope therefore my right hon. Friend will reconsider the whole matter and bring it back on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a sharp, succinct debate. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) asked about the changes being considered. The essential point which must be emphasised is that, although the eligibility rule may become less rigid, the tests of suitability under New Clause 10 will remain unchanged.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1002</span>
These tests refer directly to the applicant's ability as the future farmer of the holding, and that is of greatest importance and relevance.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) asked what was meant by applied". I can only say that provisions of the scheme are" applied' twice in line 9; there is nothing semantic about that. His argument about voluntary arrangements should, I suggest, be advanced on another clause.<br><br>
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that I have tried to get the balance right. We are legislating for a substantial period of years—not as short as the Conservatives would prefer. Our legislation. however, does not cover so long a period that we would be depriving landowners of their holdings. I do not want to harm the landlord-tenant relationship. We are not arguing about the ownership of land. This relationship has survived for a long time. I have tried to achieve the right balance and therefore I must tell my hon. Friends that I cannot look at this matter again. I want a decision from the Committee today. We have talked long enough. Let us have a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the balance between? My right hon. Friend says the average tenancy is 30 to 40 years and therefore there is a possibility of a 60 to 8O-years term over two transfers. He says that this is neither too short nor too long, but surely we are talking of a period of between one and 80 years. What balance is being struck?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend cannot understand what I mean, that is his responsibility. I believe that I have achieved the right balance and I am glad to say that the NFU, which represents the major section of tenant farmers, has broadly accepted my proposal—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But what is the balance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearl</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have taken that decision. I will stand on it. I should like to know what his balance is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Buchan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My balance would be perpetuity.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed New Clause, Amendment (z) in line 75, after "applied", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or a tenancy of the holding was granted to an eligible person".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we can also discuss the following:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Amendment (p), line 75, leave out " each of the last two occasions" and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"the last occasion".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment (aa), line 76, leave out " (within the meaning of subsection (i) above)".</p>
<p>Amendment (ii), line 78, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or, if they applied on the last occasion when there died such a tenant and a tenancy of the land was granted, or was deemed to be granted, to any person specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of subsection (1) hereof".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition having come to the aid of the Government, perhaps the Government will consider coming to the aid of the Opposition, because in this amendment a substantial point of great importance arises. Its purpose is to ensure that a succession by an "eligible person", as defined in subsection (3), will count if the tenancy is let to him or to her voluntarily instead of having proceedings before the tribunal. In his last remarks, the Minister spent a lot of time telling the Committee it was his wish not to harm the relationship between landlord and tenant. I must tell him that, in my view, unhappily, that has already occurred. But it would be quite wrong if matters were to be made worse by disadvantaging those landlords who voluntarily hand on the tenancies of farms to succeeding tenants who, in their view, are suitabl.<br><br>
We have had a great deal of discussion on this already. The Committee will know that I have been a beneficiary of my landlord's goodwill in this matter, as my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1004</span>
mother was, too. It would seem that if this amendment or a similar one is not allowed the land owner will be penalised for granting the tenancy voluntarily. He would have to insist on proceedings, to get a tribunal direction, to ensure the new tenancy counted under (f). Surely, this would be a waste of time and money. We have talked a lot already about lining lawyers' pockets. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) does not always agree that that is a bad thing, and we understand his views. But everybody in the countryside runs efficient businesses in terms of trying to keep down bureaucracy and overheads. If farmers are famed for not filling in forms, it is because they do not like unnecessary paper work.<br><br>
I can see nothing more unnecessary than having to go to a tribunal if there is only one eligible person and the landlord wishes to pass the tenancy on to that person. In the previous debate a new and, in my opinion, very dangerous concept started to creep into our deliberations—that this legislation is designed to ensure a continuity of tenancy simply for agricultural reasons. As I understand it, and as the Government have continually propounded, the philosophy behind these New Clauses is to prevent hardship and to to ensure that a tenant's son, who, in the view of some people, should morally have a right to continue on the farm, should do so. Whether he has never reached the age of majority and gained a living from the farm has absolutely nothing to do with the question of whether he should succeed.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemen who have now left the Committee have tried on two separate occasions to introduce a new concept into this argument. Already the Minister, who unhappily is having to leave us again, has admitted that three tenancies can result from these proposals; and he has further admitted that the average period of tenancy is from 30 to 40 years. This proves what we have said on many occasions, that this legislation will lead
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1005</span>
to a tenancy of perhaps 100 years or more. We cannot be accused of exaggerating. Three tenancies of 30 years would total 90 years and three of 40 years, 120 years. So it is not exaggerating to say 100 years is a reasonable estimate of the time involved.<br><br>
With this amendment we are discussing Amendments (<i>aa</i>) and (<i>ii</i>). It might be helpful if I said a few words on these because my hon. Friends and I consider that, to some extent, they have been dealt with on the previous amendment on which the Committee divided, and it would appear that the Government and the Opposition were to some extent in agreement. In these amendments, we ask the Government to go even further towards our point of view, because, unlike the Minister, we do not believe that 100 or 120 years is a reasonable period. Far from it. We believe it is a very grave injustice which will totally wreck the landlord and tenant system. I cannot conceive how the Government can possibly argue that it will not. Professional advisers will have an obvious duty to their clients to advise them to sell owner-occupied land becoming free from tenancy under this proposed legislation. This is common ground to anybody who has the remotest understanding of how these matters work. There may be some hope of slightly ameliorating the effects of these proposals by these amendments.<br><br>
On Amendment (<i>p</i>), the New Clause enables subsequent compulsory succession to the tenancy of a holding. This will be a very strong deterrent to voluntary letting. It is worth repeating the arguments about the Rent Acts. I do not accept what one or two hon. Gentlemen have said, that these do not apply. There is substantial precedent in the Rent Acts. The protected tenancy of a dwelling under the Rent Act may be passed on twice to a close relative, but where the original tenant dies
<br><blockquote><p>"leaving a widow who was residing with him at his death",</p></blockquote>
the statutory tenancy passes to the widow. A further succession is then allowed on the death of a successor and again the second successor must be the widow. If the first successor dies leaving a widow who is residing with him—this is from Section 3 and Schedule 1 of the Rent Act 1968. Where either the original tenant or the first successor leaves a widow, the statutory tenancy under the Rent Acts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1006</span>
goes on for only one further generation after the death of the original tenant.<br><br>
Unlike the Rent Acts, the New Clause does not require succession by the widow, and under these clauses a widow is unlikely to succeed. We all agree that the typical case, which the Government had in mind in instructing the Parliamentary draftsmen, was for a son to succeed and then possibly the son's son. Amendment (<i>p</i>) would effectively limit the succession to one case only. I believe we have made out a fair precedent under the Rent Act, which was passed under the last Labour administration; and this amendment is based on the same philosophy.<br><br>
Amendment (<i>aa</i>) is really a probing amendment on which the Government may be able to help us. It would seem that the words in brackets
<br><blockquote><p>"within the meaning of subsection (i) above"</p></blockquote>
limit the meaning of "tenant". The result could be in certain cases that the <i>de facto</i> tenant in occupation of the holding will not be deemed to be "the tenant" for the purpose of these clauses. If, for example, the tenant in occupation who derived his title from the previous tenant dies and a close relative succeeds him, the succession would not count. This limits the meaning of "tenant". The reference is unnecessary because of the opening words of paragraph (<i>f</i>)—"if they applied".—that is, if the New Clauses applied and they would not apply except in the case of a tenant as defined in subsection (i) of the clause. This may be a wrong interpretation, but I am advised that we have this correct and I hope the Minister will consider helping us in that small technical matter.<br><br>
Amendment (ii) is very similar to Amendment (<i>p</i>) which would limit the succession to one occasion only. To some extent, it retains the limitation to two successions already in the clause but restricts it to one where the successor was a child or treated child of the deceased. We go back again to what was the original thought behind the clause. I was surprised, to put it mildly, when the right hon. Gentleman said the National Farmers' Union had not asked for one succession only. As a strong sup—Porter of both the NFU and the Country Landowners' Association, I have no wish to be drawn into any dispute between those two bodies, but from what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0553">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1007</span>
I know of the arguments it seemed to me that there was some common ground on the question of one succession only. I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon), who is more involved in these things, can enlighten the Committee in greater detail on that.<br><br>
I am interested, therefore, to learn that the NFU now looks upon more than one succession as what it requires. I must repeat that to take away from a man possession of his property for 100 years or more does not seem in any way commensurate with the principles of Parliament or the NFU, or most of the things we do. I am very sad that we should be doing things of this nature in an unprecedented manner, not extending to any other form of property ownership of which I know, without proper compensation or any thought to the future of people who invested in the land of this country.<br><br>
I have mentioned the Rent Acts, and the same arguments apply to Amendment (<i>ii</i>). Although this amendment is less dramatic than Amendment (<i>p</i>), I would hope that the Government, when deliberating further—as the right hon. Gentleman has said they will—will look on it as a compromise. We on this side attempt to put forward constructive amendments that will make the legislation more workable for those who have to carry it out, suggestions that will lead, hopefully, to less disputes, less appearances before the Agricultural Lands Tribunal, and to a better, easier understanding of the law. We attach the greatest possible importance to Amendment (<i>z</i>). We would hope that, if the Minister is unable to help us over Amendment (<i>p</i>) then Amendment (<i>ii</i>) might be acceptable.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Benyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend on Amendment (<i>z</i>). I cannot believe that it is right or logical, if a tenancy is voluntarily agreed between landlord and tenant, that it should not count as a succession. I have a tenant whose family have been tenants on the same land for 400 years. If I have to give the successor to that tenancy notice to quit before I can establish rights under the Bill, that is stupid and unnecessary. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to meet us on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1008</span>
Amendment (<i>z</i>) if on nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned earlier that as a result of the present wording of subsection (1) of this clause the succession provisions will apply each time a tenant dies leaving one or more close relatives. It is not necessary for succession actually to take place or even for an application for succession to be made.<br><br>
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) is not present. The answer to his question is that if they are applicable, as the Bill is currently drafted, a succession is deemed to have taken place.<br><br>
If on the death of the tenant the landlord voluntarily concedes succession to a close relative, that is to say, it is arranged by agreement between the parties, this will have already counted as "one occasion" for the purpose of paragraph (<i>f</i>) of subsection (5). Therefore, I do not consider this amendment to paragraph (<i>f</i>) to be necessary.<br><br>
However, the wording of paragraph (<i>f</i>) clearly needs tidying up. I propose, therefore, to table an amendment on Report to provide that only when a tenancy passes from a deceased tenant to a close relative, whether by agreement or as a result of a decision by the ALT, will it count as one succession.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members on both sides will regard that as a fair way to go about solving the problem. Surely, a succession should be deemed to have taken place only when it actually takes place. We do not want the situation to arise where a voluntarily agreed succession by landlord and tenant is deemed not to be a succession unless there has been a notice to quit and the formal procedure has been gone through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beayon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the question of death, and again we get to this impasse. What happens if the succession is agreed before the death?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to confuse the issue. I propose to deal with that point in the "clause stand part" debate. The matter was raised also in connection with voluntary retirement, when I said that I would come to it in greater detail later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will make for much better relations if the hon. Gentleman

allows the son to take over from the father before the death of the father. When a landlord dies there is not much time in which to come to a voluntary arrangement, but when the question of inheritance is decided before the death of the landlord much more time is available for making the arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As raid, I shall deal with that matter in the "clause stand part" debate.<br><br>
Amendment (<i>aa</i>) is inappropriate. If the qualifying words:
<br><blockquote><p>"wilhin the meaning of subsection (1)"</p></blockquote>
are taken out of paragraph (f) of subsection (6), the word "tenant" would have the meaning as defined in Section 94(1) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, which includes the executors, administrators, committee of the estate, or trustee in bankruptcy of a tenant or other person deriving title from a tenant. The deletion proposed would mean that the death of a sole executor, which by virtue of subsection (1) of new Clause 8 cannot give rise to a succession, would nevertheless constitute an occasion when a tenant died for the purposes of calculating whether the landlord was due for an exemption under paragraph (<i>f</i>).<br><br>
Under the amendment, a landlord, when checking back to see whether an application of the Act took place might rind that one of the last two deaths of tenants happened to be the death of an executor. But this would not be of any advantage to him because, as the succession provisions do not apply on the death of an executor, no claim for exemption under paragraph (<i>f</i>) can be based on the death of such a person.<br><br>
These are highly technical matters, but I hope that what I have said meets the point.<br><br>
I come to Amendment (<i>ii</i>). As I have already explained in reply to Amendments (<i>c</i>) and (<i>p</i>) we believe that a maximum of two successions strikes an acceptable compromise between the two points of view in the Committee. The proposal in Amendment (<i>ii</i>) by hon. Members opposite has one particular drawback. Although ostensibly allowing two successions in one set of circumstances, that is, from tenant to widow followed by the son, and only one succession in the other set of circumstances, that is, from tenant to the son only, the time span achieved in practice would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1010</span>
the same in either case. So the tenancy would only be handed down through one generation, whereas the Government's scheme, basically, is to hand down the tenancy to two generations.<br><br>
This is a question of balance. My hon. Friends have explained where they stand and how strongly they feel, but Opposition Members wish to narrow down the provisions. The amendment to which my right hon. Friend referred, which limited the succession to one, would go too far. I ask Opposition Members to accept that the Government have had to strike a balance here, and we hope that they will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
I have replied to all the points of substance which were raised in the debate. The Government have sought to strike a fair balance. There is no doubt that what we are implementing will be of great benefit to tenant farmers and near relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a game of chance for the landlord in which the stakes are very high. The argument must be counterbalanced against the hardship argument which has been extended into a much wider area. I can only believe that the subsection will work very much to the disadvantage of the tenant over the years. I come back to the meaning of applied" in subsection (3). The brief answer we heard was not satisfactory—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the hen. Gentleman's amendment in his absence, but I will repeat what I said. We are unhappy with paragraph (<i>f</i>) as it is drafted. He asked whether it applied when it was applicable or when a succession had taken place. The answer is that as drafted it applies when it is applicable. The succession does not have to take place for one to be clocked up for the purposes of the legislation. We want to amend paragraph (<i>f</i>) to make absolutely clear that any succession, whether agreed voluntarily or as the result of a decision by the ALT, will mean that a succession has been clocked up, and a succession will be clocked up only in those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No private agreement could overrule that provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Strang</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked that question before. I think the hon. Gentleman recognises that the law is the law, and private agreements cannot override the law.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed clause, Amendment (<i>q</i>), in line 79, leave out paragraph (<i>g</i>).<br><br>
We move on to what I think the Parliamentary Secretary will describe as the principle of democratic control. That was the phrase he used in the debate in the House on 8th March when he sought to draw a distinction between holdings that were owned privately and smallholdings which are subject to democratic control. Because of the element of democratic control, he felt justified in excluding smallholdings from the provisions of this subsection.<br><br>
I am delighted that the Minister is here. He is responsible for two large smallholding estates, both of which are in my constituency, one at Holbeach and the other at Sutton Bridge. The estates total 6,500 acres. Our purpose in moving the Amendment is to enable these holdings to come within the clause as well as the better known statutory smallholdings which are controlled by the county councils and exist in almost every county in England and Wales.<br><br>
I will deal first with the Minister's smallholdings. My first contention is that they are not subject to democratic control and therefore, for the reason given in the House by the Parliamentary Secretary, they should not be cut off from the bene-</span></p>

<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 9.</p>
<p>fits of the Bill. They are not now all smallholdings. I know that it is difficult to draw the line between farms and smallholdings. It has been said that a smallholding is a holding sufficient to provide a livelihood for one man throughout the year. If that be so, some sheep farms in Northumberland and elsewhere ranging over 2,000 acres would qualify as smallholdings. There is no adequate definition of a smallholding. As a result of what has been going on in Sutton Bridge and Holbeach in the last few years, many of the smallholdings have ceased to be smallholdings and have become farms and should be treated as farms. When I was first elected for this constituency, there were about 1,000 tenants of the Minister. I put a Question down when the right hon. Gentleman was Minister before and the answer was just over 1,000, although some of them were small part-time holdings. Now the figure has been reduced, in round terms, to about 350 and the process has continued whereby those holdings are amalgamated when a tenant dies or leaves for any reason. I regret that it is only when there is a death that there is an opportunity to amalgamate.</p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p>We are dealing largely with farms rather than smallholdings. It is true that not all of them are over 100 acres. I tabled a Question recently to discover how many and was told that there had been quite an increase in the number of holdings over
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0556">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1013</span>
50 acres. Fifty acres in Lincolnshire is not 50 acres in Wales. There are farms of 50 acres where one has the opportunity to go in for three crops a year, all of them on the same land.</p>
<p>At one holding in Holbeach four crops are grown in the course of the year, not only because of the richness of the soil, but also because on the land one can grow flowers and others crops, vegetables included, giving remarkable productivity. Anyone who has not seen this land is taken aback by what can be grown from it. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be as impressed as I was when he sees this kind of farm. I thought I knew about farming, but I realised I knew little until I saw what could be produced from this rich land. A 50-acre holding, though it may appear to be a smallholding, is being farmed like a farm and has the same amount of capital and manpower put into it and its produce might be the equivalent of 150 acres elsewhere.</p>
<p>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not emphasise that we are talking about smallholdings. We are talking about farms and those of over 100 acres are sizeable farms with a great deal of capital in them. I do not understand the element of democratic control which is alleged to be the precious element about it and which makes it necessary for the tenants of the Minister not to have the privileges that other tenants will have. I must ask him a little about this democratic control. May I remind him of what he said in the debate of 8th March?:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Opposition seem to find some difficulty—this is a reflection of their political attitude—in discriminating between the powers which a private landlord should have and those which a democratically elected body should be able to exercise. This is an important principle. Statutory smallholdings are subject to democratic control. The committees which take the decisions on who should succeed are open 'to public scrutiny."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 111.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>That may be the case so far as the county council holdings are concerned where they are subject to the control of a committee of the county council.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On this point concerning county council smallholdings, would my hon. Friend agree that the smallholdings committee must work according to regulations and rules laid down under the 1970 Act? I shall be producing evidence of a case which has arisen in the last 10 days in Norfolk where it is understood
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1014</span>
that the county council concerned believes it has no right to be able to dc what it wants to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This arose from the 1970 Act. It made a number of radical changes in the attitude towards statutory smallholdings. There is no doubt that the regulations are there. They were made with some semblance of parliamentary authority because they were delegated under the 1970 Act. None the less, they are administered by officialdom. Much of the administration of the county council smallholdings could be called bureaucratic rather than democratic because of the change made in the 1970 Act. I agree entirely with what my hon. Friend said about it.<br><br>
If it has become less good so far as county council smallholdings are concerned since 1970, it has never been good so far as the Minister's smallholdings are concerned. He cannot say there is any element of democratic control regarding these tenants. The right hon. Gentleman has appointed an agent. He has an office just like any other large landlord, and he has considerable power. His powers are almost absolute. I appreciate that officials of the right hon. Gentleman's Department come down from time to time and I am not denying that they are helpful on many occasions and many of the tenants are appreciative of the advice they receive. But the control is essentially bureaucratic and not democratic.<br><br>
I cannot see how there can be any democratic element in this at all. This is not the time nor the place for me to explain what I think democracy is, but surely democracy is decisions made by elected representatives on behalf of those whose lives are affected and to whom the elected representatives are answerable. One could not say that principle applies to these 350 tenants of the Minister. The Minister has never been to see his tenants. That is sad. I wish the Minister would see them. We would give him a good welcome and like to see him any time he could come. The red carpet will be laid out all the way from Sutton Bridge to Spalding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the bulbs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, with the bulbs if the Minister comes at the right time of year. If the Minister cannot come, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will come in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0557">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1015</span>
stead. We should welcome him warmly. I hope the Minister will revise his arguments. I know he would not dare to say there was any element of democratic control. The arguments he used for excluding the statutory smallholding cannot carry any weight regarding the smallholdings for which he is responsible.<br><br>
To sum up, first of all there is no element of democratic control, and secondly in the main these are now ceasing to become smallholdings in the ordinary sense of the word and rapidly becoming farms and therefore should be treated as farms and not smallholdings. If the Minister persists in saying there is an element of democratic control, may I ask him who decides on the schemes of amalgamation and who decides the selection of the tenant? The Minister cannot say in either case that there has been any decision by a committee or democratically elected representative in any form.<br><br>
I turn now to the county council smallholdings where different principles apply and where there is some element of democracy. At least a tenant of a county council can identify his local county councillor who may be himself a member of the smallholdings committee. There are already co-opted on to the smallholdings committee smallholders themselves and therefore there is someone to gripe to, if I may use that phrase. Therefore, there is some slight improvement here. None the less, there must be great disquiet about the way these smallholders will not be protected by this New Clause.<br><br>
Not all of them are smallholders now. There have been many amalgamations. In the village in which I live in my native county of Berkshire we have a smallholdings estate and some miles away I have a farm which is adjoining another smallholdings estate. In the last 20 years there have been several amalgamations and we are now talking about farms rather than smallholdings.<br><br>
The important feature of these smallholdings estates is that they have ceased to be the first step in the ladder, that tired cliché used so often about the old smallholdings. The phrase "gateway" is used following the Wise Report. But if it is a gateway it is also a terminus. If once a person gets on one of these smallholding estates, he does not move on. More is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1016</span>
the pity. I would wish that these smallholdings were an opportunity for a young man, having had his farming education and his initial training elsewhere, to take over a small farm, learning the problems of management at first hand, saving up some capital and then going on to have a farm on his own account.<br><br>
This is not the picture. It has long ceased to be. It just does not work out like that. To begin with, the rents are very often far too low—little more than those for council houses. I know from seeing at first hand what happens when the slightest thing arises in the way of maintenance of buildings. The kindly landlord arranges for the merest slate off the roof to be replaced at the expense of the ratepayer. There has been an element of mollycoddling in some of these estates which has been unfortunate. Perhaps I am being a little empirical and controversial, and this may not be the experience in respect of other tenants in other areas. Certainly my experience is that once a person is in one of these estates he stays there.<br><br>
Therefore, these estates are not serving the purpose for which they were intended. It is doubtful whether ratepayers' money should be used to enable men to stay in farming for such long periods on the same holding, thereby blocking any chances of promotion or opportunity for younger men. Men are continuing to work on the estates when they are in their sixties and seventies when they should have long since moved somewhere else.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I realise that the Association of County Councils and individual county councils have been lobbying Members and urging them to oppose the amendment. They wish to retain the same rights as private landlords. I hope that Labour hon. Members who are metaphorically below the Gangway will not subscribe to that point of view. I hope that they will share my view that what is good for the goose is good for the gander.<br><br>
I believe that we should not draw a distinction between the two classes of tenant. If we are to make this radical change in our agricultural laws and give one class of tenant a privilege—that is the appropriate word—there is no moral reason for the same problems not being shared by all tenants.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1017</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has presented a forceful case and we look forward to the reply to this important amendment, but will my hon. Friend substantiate what he has said with statistics? It would be helpful for the Committee to know how many tenants of smallholdings move on to larger tenanted farms or to own their own farms. If the facts are as my hon. Friend has generalised, their production would add weight to his case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the Ministry is in possession of such facts. No doubt we shall hear about them if they are in its possession. My hon. Friend will have studied carefully the memorandum submitted to us by the Association of County Councils. From the memorandum it is clear that it has been the policy of county councils in most areas to amalgamate holdings and to make groups of smallholdings into farms.<br><br>
That is manifestly the policy of many county councils. It is a policy that has operated rather slowly because so few tenants leave the holdings except on retakes place at quite an old age, often at Takes place at quite an old age, often at 70-plus. I urge my hon. Friend to have particular regard to the difficulties that are set out in paragraph 7 of the memorandum, which gives an example of one county which may well be Norfolk. It illustrates how the county is progressing in its policy of amalgamation. Perhaps that is not a complete answer to my hon. Friend's question, but I hope that it is a satisfactory reply.<br><br>
Finally, I ask the Minister about some of his other tenanted farms. I appreciate that they are not in my constituency. On gave a list of his tenanted farms in 17th March, in a Written Answer, he respect of which no exemption is intended and which will fall within. the terms of the clause. It is a surprising number. There are many farmers in Cumbria that are owned by the Minister, and in this instance I rather suspect that there has been collusion between the two Front Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jopling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend looks at the list, he will find that none is in my constituency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the exact location of Broadwath and Thursby.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1018</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not in my division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then there is Carlisle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is Willie Whitelaw's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps some of my suspicions are justified. I am glad that the Minister is progressing into this form of landlordism, although I regret to see this legislation. A large number of farms are listed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jan Ellis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is nationalisation by the back door.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a surprising list. Perhaps some account will be given of the Ministry's stewardship. I believe that that would be in order in view of the number of farms that has been acquired in recent times by the Ministry. As the clause is to apply to these farms, it would be proper for the Minister to explain why they have been nationalised and whether it is intended that they be permanently under the control of the Minister. Perhaps my hon. Friend for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) will give an assurance that they will be denationalised as soon as he has responsibility for these matters.<br><br>
The farms run into many acres. There are 14 farms at Andover and 34 farms in Cheshire. I do not know whether Frodsham is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>:When I represented Billericay I am sure that the Pantiles farm was never owned by the Minister.<br><br>
The list is surprising. It covers a substantial amount of property. There are 21 farms at Laxton, Nottinghamshire and five at Peacehaven. Sussex. The Minister says that the exemption will not apply to these farms. Therefore, the tenants will be able to take advantage of the clause, and sons and others will be able to succeed. Why cannot the same provision be extended to the farms at Holbeach and Sutton Bridge. I know that he has them under his control because he refers to them as statutory smallholdings. However, for the reasons I have advanced, they are no longer smallholdings in the normal sense. In the main, they are becoming farms, and better farms than most of the things that he has in Essex, and certainly in Cumbria—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A disproportionate amount of the nation's capital goes into these areas. I cannot imagine that anyone can draw a sensible distinction between the list to which I have referred and the farms I have spoken about at Holbeach and Sutton Bridge. Therefore, I urge the Minister to think again. Should not the same rules apply to the amalgamations that will apply to the other holdings that he has acquired, by means which we know not, in other parts of the country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) with all the strength at my command, because I feel very strongly about the matter.<br><br>
It is only in the booklet with the orange cover that we find the relevant statistics, but like so many Government statistics they are so out of date as to be of limited use. However, the figures are of some use. We must make allowances for the fact that they continue only to 31st March 1974.<br><br>
There are about 11,000 tenants who come under this category. About 423,000 acres are involved. This is not a matter that we can put on one side as a small problem. We are talking about 11,000 human beings who suffer exactly the same hardships as other categories. It is our purpose to alleviate families from hardship.<br><br>
I shall make my position clear. I was totally opposed to this form of legislative change by means of the Bill. It changes many of the provisions in the Agricultural Holdings Acts, legislation, which is the bible of the landlord and tenant. Although the Minister may deny this, I believe that he was shocked when the wise men behind him told him that he would need eight clauses. I believe that he would not have embarked upon this course if he had known what would happen. However, I am prepared to take his word that he knew exactly what would happen before he started intr-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1020</span>
ducing these provisions.<br><br>
I believe that we should not have made these changes without a complete overhaul of the Agricultural Holdings Acts. I appreciate that the Minister has said that there should be such an overhaul. I believe that we shall greatly harm the landlord and tenant system. Such harm could have been avoided if we had undertaken the overhaul to which I have referred. We could have breathed new life into the landlord and tenant system. We could have provided for long leases and new arrangements to enable landlords and 'tenants to enter into partnerships, as is done in other countries. That is what we must aim for in future.<br><br>
The changes that the Bill proposes will create many legal difficulties. At present very few cases come before the Agricultural Lands Tribunal. My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has referred to the number that go before the tribunal annually. The tribunal will have to deal with many times that number. This cannot do anything but create bad blood in the countryside.<br><br>
As I pointed out—this has not been denied by the Minister—we are creating other cases of hardship.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going very wide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Costain. I am trying to explain why I must support the amendment. I believe that without it we shall be making the job of professional men extremely difficult. All sorts of problem will arise.<br><br>
I have acknowledged that there will be cases of hardship. I think it will be acknowledged by the Minister that I am sincere. I said that I was prepared for the son to inherit and that I was prepared to support the son's succession, but I am not prepared to go along with successions to the brother, sister and spouse. I believe that sort of succession to be harmful to agricultural production. Much more could have been done by providing financial assistance—</span></p>

overstepping the mark, but I have been leading up to my main point, which is that we have passed the point of no return.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I not correct in assuming that my hon. Friend can make points about paragraph (g) only by describing the obverse of the situation so as to put the whole matter in its context?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am endeavouring to do while always keeping within the rules of order.<br><br>
We come now to another wrong-doing which is being committed towards a particular class of tenant, namely, the statutory tenants of county council smallholdings and certain tenants of the Minister. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and I refuse to believe that it is right to treat these tenants as second class citizens, but that is what is happening. If we have decided to ease hardship for some tenants, how can it be right to deny that alleviation to other tenants who have less money, less opportunity to earn a living elsewhere and less financial backing to buy a holding or, if there is another holding to let, to hire another holding?<br><br>
I challenge the Minister as a Member of Parliament to tell the tenant of a 75-acre county council holding or a 20-acre holding under the Land Settlement Association that his son will not have the right to inherit the tenancy but that it will go to one of the big farmers in the constituency who hires 1,000 acres and whose son may inherit in those circumstances.<br><br>
I do not believe that it is right to behave in this way, and I am sure that the Minister does not think it is right either. This is double-dealing. We are told that because the landlord is the county council or the Minister there is no fear that the tenant will be treated harshly. I served on the Norfolk County Council smallholdings committee from 1949 to 1970. In many cases, we leaned over backwards to enable tenants' sons to inherit. There are certain cases, however, where the law, as it is interpreted by the smallholdings committee, does not allow it to do the right thing.<br><br>
May I refer to a report in the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i> for Wednesday 24th March which referred to a smallholder on a county council tenancy at Bacton in the constituency of my hon, Friend the Mem-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1022</span>
ber for Norfolk, North (Mr. Howell). Mr. Martin Brown has been farming his father's smallholding, because of the father's illness, for the past nine years. He had worked with his father since he left school 27 years ago. Now the father has died leaving Mr. Brown, aged 42, with his mother, who is 78, on the holding, and they have been given notice to quit. The county council has considered the matter and reconsidered it. It says that all it can do is to offer Mr. Brown a cottage with no land attached, and Mr. Brown has said that factory work would never suit him and he would be likely to become a farm labourer if he could find a job in the area. He says that he will receive no compensation.<br><br>
The cause of all this is that the county council is duty bound under schemes already agreed to amalgamate the land with four or five other holdings in the district. The law does not allow for any other course of action. Our amendment would enable such a case to be considered by the Agricultural Land Tribunal. Perhaps I may quote from the leading article of the <i>Eastern Daily Press</i> which says
"<br><blockquote><p>The case of Mr. Martin Brown, the Bacton smallholder who has been served with a notice to quit by Norfolk County Council, is arousing within his community and fraternity an indignation that is as merited as it is eloquent. <i>What is at issue is not legality but morality; not the letter of the law, which is being correctly administered by the county council, but the ethics</i> … Mr. Brown has been managing and working the fifty-acre smallholding for nine years, following the incapacity of his father … <i>Now modernisation in the interests of efficiency and productivity is not to be dismissed, but its pursuit is not always attentive to human considerations, as millions of Kulaks discovered in the most monstrous illustration known to man.</i></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p><i>To be uprooted is, of course, greatly preferable to being liquidated, but the prospect of Mr. Martin Brown and his elderly widowed mother being turned out of Grange Farm so that the fifty acres can be distributed among five neighbouring county council tenancies is sufficient cause for outrage in our Norfolk eyes."</i></p></blockquote>
I knew Mr. Jimmy Coe, whom I expect the Minister knew, of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, who was one of the finest of men and a great friend of mine and was chairman of the smallholdings committee for many years. I know, too, the present chairman, Mr. Fred Nicholson, another great friend of mine. Both are dedicated men. They would not cause hardship to people if they could avoid it. It is only because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1023</span>
they cannot refer such matters as this to bodies like the tribunals that the cases arise in the first place.<br><br>
The Minister has introduced the new clauses with the purpose of eliminating hardship, and I cannot therefore believe that he will treat the sons of smaller farmers on a different and worse basis than the sons of larger farmers.<br><br>
I have a letter from the National Farmers' Union dated 20th March which says
<br><blockquote><p>"My Executive Committee are seriously concerned about the provisions of the new clause introduced by the Minister to the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is now before Parliament and dealing with family succession to farm tenancies. While they accept the National Farmers' Union support for these measures in principle, there are, they feel, two particular points which should be corrected before they reach the Statute Book".</p></blockquote>
The first is relevant to our debate today. It is
<br><blockquote><p>"That statutory smallholdings and particularly the smallholdings owned and run by County Councils should be covered by the proposed legislation.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>There can, in my Committee's opinion, be no justification for preventing the tenants of these holdings from having the same security as it is proposed to give to agricultural tenants generally and the argument that these holdings form the bottom rung of the farming ladder does not really hold water under conditions as they will be following this legislation."</p></blockquote>
I agree with that. During the time that I served on the Norfolk County Council smallholdings committee I came across very few cases—I do not think there were as many as 10 in those 21 years—which went outside those smallholdings and were able to take on bigger holdings. There is, therefore, no stepping stone there, and under the Government's proposals that avenue will certainly remain closed.<br><br>
The Minister certainly understands hardship. Surely he cannot condone unfair treatment whereby the sons of tenants on smaller holdings in my constituency are treated worse than the sons of farmers who farm, say, 1,000 acres five miles away in Swaffham. I submit that no Member of Parliament could condone that nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to elicit some information from the Minister because there is undoubtedly a great weight of argument in the case put forward by my hon. Friend and in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1024</span>
statistics which have been sent out by the Association of County Councils. I refer to the statistics which accompanied its letter of 27th February this year which show the serious situation which is developing within smallholdings.<br><br>
The main statistics for smallholdings in England and Wales as at 31st March 1975 show that there are 9,840 smallholdings. They include part-time, intermediate, starter and commercial holdings. The 1970 Act requested the local authorities to draw up re-organisation plans to turn their smallholdings into commercially more viable units. If the figures are correct, the number of 9,840 is being reduced, subject to finance being available and satisfactory arrangements being concluded with the existing tenants, to 5,710. That is a fairly dramatic reduction in the number of holdings available to those who wish to go into farming. Perhaps, above all, it highlights the kind of case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). What is to happen to all those tenants' sons and close relatives who are at present farming with their father when their father dies and they are then faced with a notice to quit, as in the case of Mr. Brown in my hon. Friend's constituency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not in my constituency but in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Howells).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have quite rightly drawn attention to the fact that there is one rule for a tenant of a private landowner and there is to be another, very different rule for tenants of the Government or a county council. I am not taking a hard line on this because I have much sympathy with the position in which the Minister finds himself and therefore I shall listen with considerable attention to his answer. But I would ask him to comment on the inevitable difficulties which will arise if the number of small holdings is to he dramatically reduced from approximately 9,840 to about 5,700. Are there to be many cases like that put forward to the Committee by my hon. Friend? It is a difficult point, and I await the Minister's reply with great interest.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I have some sympathy with what has been said by the Opposition, I must disagree with the amendment. I have had the privilege of being a member of Cardigan County Council for 23 years, and I believe county council small holdings committees over the years have been among the pioneers in helping young farmers up the farming ladder. They have done a great deal of work, but unfortunately they have not been able to finish the job so ably started, due to lack of capital. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West, said that there are 11,000 tenant farmers farming 430,000 acres of land in Britain, which works out at about 40 acres each. But I wonder if he has figures showing how many of the 11,000 tenant farmers are tenants of county councils. If it were included, the acreage farmed by small holding tenants could be even smaller.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that, according to the table in this book, the number of tenants in England and Wales is 9,136.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member, but I know from my experience as a practical farmer that over the years many county council smallholders have moved on to bigger farms and are farming on their own.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will get the figure from the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Body</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has raised a very important point. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West and I have said this could be a stepping stone. It has been a terminus as well as a gateway. My hon. Friend has said that in Norfolk—and he has served for 21 years on a smallholdings committee—he knew of only 10 cases where people had passed on to a larger holding of their own. Can the hon. Gentleman say whether there are as many as that in Cardigan?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. From my experience, many farmers who farm county council smallholdings have moved on, but I am trying to make the point that the purpose of the statutory smallholdings committee in different parts of the coun
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1026</span>
try is to try to help young farmers to become larger farmers outside the smallholdings legislation. But, in my view, the only reason why many smallholders do not go on is lack of capital.<br><br>
I have asked the right hon. Gentleman to look at the possibility of setting up a land bank to help youngsters, since lack of capital is the main reason why a majority of smallholders have not been able to move on to better pastures and become first-class farmers, playing a major role in producing more food for the nation. I hope the Minister will confirm his assurance that he will look into the possibility of setting up a land bank. Perhaps since the last sitting of the Committee, when he gave that assurance, he has made further progress in a European context. If that money will be made available to smallholders, it will be a good thing for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not like the idea of a land bank.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a silly, Liberal idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be an idea to be looked at in Europe, but basically I believe in a pricing system which gives a fair return.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister for his reply. He will know my views on the land bank, but for the sake of young people entering the agriculture industry and those already in it I hope he will do his utmost to help them in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: According to the 24th Annual Report to Parliament on smallholdings in England and Wales, Table 1 attributes a total of 808 acres to Cardigan. This compares with 40,476 in Norfolk, and in Suffolk 16,000, representing approximately 6 per cent. of the let land in my county—and it is the fifth largest of all the county council estates in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will accept the principle of helping the small farmer. Although the acreage in Cardigan is small, the principle is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To talk of a small acreage is a vast overstatement in terms of 808 acres when we are talking of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1027</span>
total of 414,000 acres. I am torn on this matter. From the standpoint of county councils, one can well see that they are anxious to discharge the duties that they have acquired in the past 70 years or so, and which have been imposed on them, particularly in terms of the 1970 Act, to pursue reorganisation and amalgamation of holdings. Amalgamation is a patient task which requires a number of years to come to fructification and for the land to fall in. Therefore, I would have sympathy with my county council. However, the Suffolk County Council Land Agent says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am certainly glad to see that statutory smallholders are to be excluded from the provisions of the Bill, although I accept that this will inevitably lead to discontent amongst our tenants."</p></blockquote>
So it appears that the authorities anticipate discontent among their tenants. I am discontented, although I put on a brave face, because I do not see why what has been visited on the private landlord should not be visited on the public sector. Why should that be immune? I find it a very difficult argument to overcome within myself. I could go down a lane by my house and turn right, and, with not very far to go, I would come across tenant farmers with from 300 acres to 3,000 acres. Those with 300 acres are operating without any help. This is arable farming. If I turn left and go uphill, I come to land of the Land Settlements Association, which I presume is comprehended within paragraph (<i>g</i>) or perhaps paragraph (<i>h</i>).<br><br>
I could not find it within my personal capacity to say to a tenant of the Land Settlement Association or even county
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1028</span>
council tenants, "It is just bad luck; you have to rely on the rules of succession as promulgated in regulations, admittedly as guidance by the Minister, and then filled in in detail by the county council; whereas X, Y or Z has a charter to point to, in terms of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1976". I would not attempt to rationalise that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the question of amalgamation, under the new clauses the landlords will be able to put before the Agricultural Lands Tribunal the fact that they want to amalgamate within the next two years with another holding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>:Two years is a very short time in terms of amalgamation planning. It often takes a decade, if not more, of careful, patient planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:This is a new reason whereby the landlord could obtain possession and therefore, even if the tenants of smallholdings were to get the benefits of the new clauses—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearl: I am glad the hon. Gentleman speaks of benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—there is this saver whereby, if the landlord amalgamated, they could gain possession. The argument of the smallholdings committees falls down because that advice was written before the Minister introduced his proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stainton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wholly agree—</span></p>
