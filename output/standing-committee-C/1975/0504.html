</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had started on this amendment, which relates to the offence committed by an undischarged bankrupt of either alone or jointly with any other person obtaining credit to an extent, as it was, of£10 from any other person without informing that person that he was an undischarged bankrupt as set out in Section 155(a) of the 1914 Bankruptcy Act. I had explained to the Committee that I had some reservations about the situation as it would stand in the light of the Government's own amendment of increasing the amount of the limit here from£10 to£120 applying the multiplier of 12 which we have applied in so many other instances throughout the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in a sense arguing against myself here, but I think it is right in matters of this kind that, if a Minister feels concerned, he should take the Committee into his confidence and this I am doing. I am concerned about the aggregation of borrowings, because there can be a whole series of borrowings just short of the limit of£120 and yet it is conceivable that no offence would be committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that with a certain amount of qualification, because it may well be that,
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
if an undischarged bankrupt were to embark upon a deliberate system of fraud by obtaining credits of, say, up to£119 from a series of separate lenders, offences under Section 15 of the Theft Act—that is, obtaining property by deception—or under Section 16—obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception—would be committed, but there is no certainty of that situation arising. Whether a charge under the Theft Act would lie must dependupon the facts of each individual case, but it is right that I should point out that qualification to some of my anxieties about the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) raised another interesting point. He said that, if one is to have a criminal offence, there ought to be a rounding up of the figure rather than for it to be£120 or£75. I think he was thinking of£100. I have a certain amount of sympathy with that, because this is not an area where the strict application of monetary limits is all that correct, in my judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing about the offence itself is that it is an absolute offence. No question of intention on the part of the bankrupt arises. It is not subject to his knowledge or intent. I considered, of course, the point that Justice made in that respect. It said that it ought not to be an absolute offence any longer—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The offence ought simply to be a failure to pay the debt incurred within a specified time of incurring it—[	<i>Interruption,</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that I could have the attention of the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival). I know that there are problems, but I am trying to deploy a somewhat complex argument and I think it will be of interest to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholly understand that point of view, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will also understand my point of view. I am absolutely between two stools. I want to listen to the hon. Gentleman's argument, and I think that it is an important one. On the other hand, I have to try, while the Committee is proceeding, to decide what course to take on the motionwhich he has indicated will be moved later. It is a very unfortunate situation. I regret as much as he that my attention is divided at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
present. I do not know whether he would think it better to adjourn for 10 minutes so that we can consider these things, but I entirely agree with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a better suggestion. The hon. and learned Gentleman might carry on his consultations when one of his hon. Friends is on his feet. But I understand the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I try to wrest the attention of the hon. and learned Gentleman from his difficulties for one moment, because I want to deal with the Justice argument? It would imply—in fact, it would be express—that the bankrupt would have a defence if he could establish that he had reasonable prospects of paying the debt at the time that he obtained the credit. I, too, am troubled by that proposition, for a number of reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I believe that the change would seriously affect the protection which Section 155(a) of the 1914 Act currently gives to the trading public. It is implicit in the proposals that the bankrupt will no longer be under an obligation to disclose his status when obtaining credit. The offence would no longer be an absolute one. Although it is true that the proposal places the onus of proof on the bankrupt, a prosecution would not be launched without some inquiries being made as to whether the bankrupt had a reasonable prospect of paying his debt. That would in many cases create a situation in which the prosecution could not be sure that an offence had been committed, and in consequence there would be doubt as to whether a prosecution should be instituted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test as to whether the bankrupt had a reasonable prospect of discharging the debt would he a subjective one. Even if the probability of payment was so remote that it belonged to the realms of hope rather than belief, the bankrupt would, in the absence of any evidence of fraud, have a defence if he could persuade the court that he had such a belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Southport has considerable experience, both on the bench and at the Bar, of Section 332 of the Companies Act which relates to trading while insolvent for a fraudulent purpose. I am sure that he will agree that there is considerable
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
difficulty in establishing the intent in that connection. I speak from only a limited experience of legal practice in this respect, and I have always thought that is was almost as difficult—if not more difficult—to obtain a conviction under Section 332, unless the facts were manifest and plain, as for the old offence of receiving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has, therefore, to look in considerable depth into whether the proposal would become counter-productive. I have come to the conclusion, after listening carefully to the representations that have been made, that it would not be a desirable change. It would shift the balance against the creditor, about which the hon. and learned Gentleman has expressed considerable reservation in debates on previous amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Committee will consider with some favour the proposition that I now advance. I believe that there are real difficulties about the courses that have been proposed from both sides of the Committee. I take into account the strong point made by the hon. and learned Member for Darwen as to the need for some definite, rounded-up figure in considering a criminal offence of such gravity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is need to deal, if we can, with the aggregate point. It will not be easy, because it means the creation of a new offence. However, if the Committee is to deal with the matter in that way, we must be able to couple the aggregate limit with a period of time. It would be monstrously unfair, over a period of years of a bankruptcy, for the aggregation to take place throughout those years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose, therefore, that we look again at the whole matter on Report. That will give us time to reflect with rather less haste on the matter. I am not sure that we shall arrive at the perfect solution even then, but perhaps consultation—dare I say that after last night—between the usual channels might be helpful—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—notwithstanding what may be happening elsewhere. The hon. and learned Member and I have consulted about the Bill and I see no harm in continuing those consultations in the weeks ahead. I hope that we shall arrive at a solution acceptable to us both, but at least under my proposal we shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
examine the arguments rather more deeply and that would be of help to the Committee. I now leave the Committee to comment on my proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not able to be here on Thursday, but I read the report of the proceedings with great interest. On reading the brief discussion on this amendment towards the end of the proceedings, I was extremely surprised. I had assumed—like my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) I am a layman in these matters—that the amount of credit that an undischarged bankrupt could obtain was already an aggregate figure. That shows that this is a complex matter with which laymen are not as conversant as they should be. When I realised that this was not so, it seemed that a veritable minefieldwas opened up in front of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) was very substantial. I am glad that the Under-Secretary has just acknowleged that. The offence of obtaining credit by an undischarged bankrupt is an absolute one. As my hon. and learned Friend said, there is no need to prove guilty intent or 	<i>mens rea</i>: the fact of doing it is enough. When that is coupled with the much greater ease with which credit can be obtained these days, both by means of credit cards and the routes open through the Consumer Credit Act, it is very disturbing that the Bill should go forward, either as proposed by the Government or amended as suggested by my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary referred to the difficulty of proving an offence under Section 332 of theCompanies Act—that a company went on trading when it had reason to believe that it wasinsolvent. That is a genuine point. On the other hand, as he will be aware, the threat of continuing to trade when one may be insolvent is a very present one in companies when they find, for example, that their assets are diminishing rapidly, and it is one that is always pointed out to the boards of directors by their solicitors as extremely serious. We shall doubtless come on to that again when we approach Clause 7. But against that background of the very severe penalties for companies if Section 332 of the Companies Act is
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
proven and the absolute nature of this offence as regards individuals, I was not happy with the Bill either as it stands or as amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It did not seem to me that rounding up the figure to £150 or £200 would be sufficient. I was very pleased, therefore, to hear what the Under-Secretary has just said and welcome it. It seems to give a far greater provision of credit than is now available and the likelihood is that in our Society this will continue. After all, the amount of consumer credit 	<i>per capita</i> in this country is still very much below that of the United States or of Australia. In view of that, the suggestion that it should be an aggregate limit is right. I should be very interested to see, when we come to Report, what figure the Under-Secretary proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman sits down I should like him to clear up a point which I should have mentioned. The position is that Amendments Nos. 17 and 27 would have the effect of increasing the minimum amount for the offence by the UDB of obtaining credit in Scotland from £10 to £250 and, in England and Wales, from £10 to £200. Would he agree with me that there is no point in offering this sop to bankrupt Scottish-Nationalists and that there ought to be no disparity between the treatment afforded to undischarged bankrupts throughout the United Kingdom in this regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Under-Secretary is raising a delightful hare which I could run after with pleasure for many hours, because, as a Scotsman by birth, though temporarily, at least, resident in England. I can see a certain advantage in having a higher limit for undischarged bankrupts in Scotland, which is probably the place to which I shall retire in due course, than in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bankrupt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will probably be sooner than I wish. On the other hand, I must accept the Minister's point in principle. As I believe strongly in the union of the United Kingdom, I should like to see comparable limits for all undischarged bankrupts throughout all the integral parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the question of the aggregate limit, I was very interested in what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
the Under-Secretary said about the possibility that someone who ran up a series of debts up to the amount of£119 each, might have committed an offence under Section 15 of the Theft Act for obtaining property by deception. As I have said before, I am not a lawyer. I am not certain whether that is an advantage or a disadvantage in this Committee, but I wonder whether it would be possible to prove that offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential debtor in that case would be quite fairly using the limits available to him under the law of the land. It is rather like using one's bank card on which one can draw any number of times up to£30. There is nothing to stop one from doing that. It is simply an individual limit imposed by the bank so that their own exposure to an individual creditor is limited accordingly. I shall be very interested in the comments of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival). But I should have thought that the deception argument could be very hard to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It leads one on, therefore, to the question which is implicit in the first point as to whether the debtor has a reasonable prospect of paying off his debts. Surely, in any circumstances what the debtor would argue is that at the time he did have a reasonable prospect of paying off his debts. This would be the obvious point for him to pursue; and he would argue, probablywith some evidence that he could adduce, that things had gone wrong for him since then, that his wife had run away with the housekeeping money, or whatever, and that, as a result, the reasonable prospect that he had entertained at the time of entering into all these contractual debts of up to£119 each had diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole prospect of this clause as it now stands therefore seems to be wrong. The total concept is wrong and it cannot be solved by a single limit of any sort. We are led back, therefore, to the Under-Secretary's point of an aggregate limit, which I agree with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the question of the time limit. Will the Under-Secretary during the course of the Committee stage tell us a little more about what he has in mind, so that we have a chance to discuss this in Committee before it comes before us in its semi-final form on
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
Report? It is difficult off the cuff to see what should be a reasonable time limit, because one gets back here to the point of 	<i>mens rea.</i> If a debtor or a potential debtor who is unable to discharge his debts is aware of the law, if he is aware that he can run up debts in aggregate only to a certain figure, it is reasonable that there should be a strict time limiton him. I fear that in many cases the debtor will not be aware of this and that he will be blundering into a pit without realising the penalty to which he is liable at the end of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, the time limit must be generous, which means that it must be a shorter period rather than an extended extensive one. It is an Alicein-Wonderland argument, but that is the way it works out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Under-Secretary can help us a little more with his thoughts at this stage about what the time limit should be, that would assist members of the Committee. However, in general terms I welcome the idea of an aggregate limit rather than a single one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an example of how a Committee debate should go, with one exception to which I shall refer in a moment. In 20 or 30 minutes, or some similarly small interval of time, we have discussed this subject sufficiently to identify three or four problems quite clearly. I pay tribute to the Minister for the attitude he has adopted here, for, the problems having been identified, instead of trying to solve them on the spot, which so often leads to bad law, he has grasped the nettle and said " We are all agreed that there are some problems here. Now let us take a little more time to see what the right answers are." That is exactly how Committees should work if they are to make a useful contribution during the passage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one thing that is missing is that we have not yet had any contribution from any hon. Member opposite except the Minister. I cannot help feeling that I know the reason. But there mustbe some useful contributions which could come from hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two of the problems which we have identified, and which I think we all accept are problems, are those of rounding up and of whether to aggregate. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
express this view at the moment. I too share the view put forward by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) that it is sensible to have round figures. At the moment my thinking is£100 as the sort of round figure which will stick in everybody's mind. We need not perhaps take much more time in arriving at that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aggregating is more difficult. Both the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) have put their finger on some of the difficulties there to which we must give some more thought. However, I want to say a word about the alternative which was raised bymy hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) at the last sitting about the Justice proposals. They would have the great merit of cutting out both the rounding up andthe aggregating difficulties. They would have the merit of getting right away from value, of getting right away from the offence we are talking about—the absolute offence which raises the two problems we have now identified—and putting the matter on a new, different and, in many ways, simpler basis. Both the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex have referred to the difficulties of proving deception. Quite rightly, when someone is charged with an offence which involves deception, both those who present the case on behalf of the Crown and the judge, in directing the jury, will be careful to tell juries that deception has to be proved. The introduction of deception introduces the element of dishonesty, as distinct from an absolute offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to be said for the proposition that one of the essences of the criminal offencehere ought to be dishonesty rather than simply a mistake. Also, although I am not as experienced as others in criminal courts, I have done some advocacy there, and I have never found a case in which there was great difficulty in proving deception or dishonesty unless the evidence was weak. If the evidence is weak, the defendant should not be convicted of dishonesty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one tries to discuss and to analyse this type of point and its requirements in Committee, one gets into a complicated discussion, whereas a jury takes a broad view. One says to a jury, " You must ask yourselves whether you are satisfied
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
that there was the intention to deceive. Are you satisfied that this was dishonest?" One doesnot, in directing a jury, give definitions of those terms. These are terms which ordinary men and women can readily grasp, and they can judge them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. and learned Friend, who has infinitely more experience of the subject than I have, would like to develop the correlation between the deception and a reasonable ability to pay off the debt. As I understand it, deception could not be provenif there was at that time a reasonable ability to pay off the debt and a reasonable prospect that it would be repaid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, but if the person who obtains the credit has, at the time that he obtains it, a reasonable prospect of repaying it, he would not be acting dishonestly. It istherefore arguable that in those circumstances he should noti be found guilty of a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one introduces the concepts of deception and dishonesty, the burden of proof is that much higher, and so it should be. However, it is not so high as to be sufficient to make this offence in substitution for the other of little value. It could still have considerable value. Itwould also have the further merit that it would only catch the person who has acted dishonestly. There is a good deal to be said for so limiting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want to say about the possibility of going over to the Justice proposal is that I wonder whether the Minister would—between now and Report—have a word with his colleagues in the Home Office, if that has not already been done, because we are talking about thecriminal law, and that is especially the province of the Home Office. It would help the Opposition if the Minister could obtain the views of the Home Office, if he has not already obtained them, and let us have them before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I am happy to respond to the Minister's suggestion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I shall not ask my hon. Friends to vote for any of theseamendments. I should have done but for the fact that the Minister has suggested that we should take time to consider this question and return to it on Report. I express that hope and expectation and give this indication, rather than seek to bring the debate to an end, because ifthe Minister wants to comment on what my hon. Friend or I have said, so be it. It would help us to hear his comments. That is a matter for him. I am not urging him to do so. I am merely indicating that, when the time comes, I shall not ask my hon. Friends to vote in support of any of the amendments. My reason for not asking them to do so, which will result, of course, in the amendments being negatived, is simply that I have no conceivable alternative and this is the best that I can do in response to the invitation extended by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I shall deal briefly withthe points which have been raised. First as to the time limit and its reasonableness, I do not know at present! I have an open mind on that. We shall consider the matter, without my offering any thoughts at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have indicated my agreement in principle with the point about rounding up. There is substance in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also indicated that, on balance, although, again, my mind is not closed to the situation, I prefer the creation of a new offence to deal with the problem of aggregation, rather than with the Justice solution, which I think will lead to immense difficulties. However, we shall consider it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absolute offence has a certain deterrent value. We shall have to consider that aspect as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the creation of a new offence, the hon. and learned Gentleman was absolutely right. Ofcourse, it is implicit in what I have said that one would have
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
to consult the Home Office carefully before undertaking to propose or accept an amendment of this character. This will be done, and at a suitable opportunity the hon. and learned Gentleman, his hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), and I will be able to discuss the results of the interim conclusions which I shall have reached after I have considered the whole matter further.

I am therefore grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman's suggestion that we should now proceed to a vote, having regard to the caveat which he has entered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 20, in page 10, line 34, leave out £60 ' andinsert£120'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What our debates so far has established clearly is that, whereas it is probably useful as a basis for discussion simply to increase all these amounts 	<i>pro rata,</i> when one looks at individual items in many cases there are substantial arguments worthy of consideration, at least, to the effect that that basis—even as a temporary one—would not meet the justice of the case in certain instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate which we have just had clearly demonstrated that. We shall now have a debate on three or four specific points. I hope that the Committee will feel that the amendments which have been tabled indicate that there are particular considerations to which we should pay attention in each of these fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shortest way to make one's point is to show the Committee what is intended by the amendments. One of the difficulties is that the schedule does not make any sense, even to a lawyer, without looking at the Acts in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I should first like to invite the attention of the Committee to Section 23(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, because it is proposed to amend that subsection in line 34 of Schedule 1, and it is the amended amount to be substituted by line 34 which is the subject of the amendment now before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 23(1)(c) deals with the arrest of a debtor in certain circumstances. One of the difficulties of this kind of legislation is that a lawyer or layman would not, on reading line 34 of the Schedule, have had any idea that what we were dealing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
with was the arrest of a debtor. This is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may have been thought that in an amendment on the minimum amount to found a petition we stressed the position of a debtor. I hope that this and the following amendments will show thatwe have been no less careful of the position of the debtor either. The question of risk is one of immense importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 23(1) of the 1914 Bankruptcy Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court may, by warrant addressed to any constable or prescribed officer of the court. cause a debtor to be arrested, and any books, papers, money and goods in his possession to be seized…".</p></blockquote>
"In his possession" does not just mean in his pockets; it means in his house, or in his office, or in his possession elsewhere.
	<br><blockquote><p>"… and him and them to be safely kept as prescribed until such time as the court may order…".</p></blockquote>
That is the consequence which is brought about by the provision of this section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those consequences may be brought about—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… under the following circumstances."</p></blockquote>
Section 23(1)(c) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, after service of a bankruptcy petition on him, or after a receiving order is made against him, he removes any goods in his possession above the value of five pounds, without the leave of the official receiver or trustee".</p></blockquote>
This may arise as early as immediately following the service of a bankruptcy petition. The debtor is at risk from that moment on. The Minister will say that these powers are rarely used, and I quite appreciate that. But that does not alter the fact that one must infer that they can be used in circumstances in which one would not wish to see them used. The first thing to do is to see what is the risk entailed for a debtor by reason of these provisions. It arises immediately after the service of a bankruptcy petition on him. What brings in the risk is if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he removes any goods in his possession above the value of five pounds, without the leave of the official receiver or trustee."</p></blockquote>
Now it is proposed in Schedule 1, in line 34, to increase that figure of£5 to £60. It is proposed in our amendment to increase it from£5 to£120. It should love it if this was increased to£200. The purpose of the amendment is to suggest to the Committee that at least a substan
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
tial further increase is called for, and not to suggest that£120 is necessarily the right figure. Here again, this point may recur through a consideration of these amendments. There is much to be said for rounding up to a figure that sticks in the mind. It is a good, practical point. Perhaps it would be better to round up to£200.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, then, is the position? If a debtor, after bankruptcy notice has been served, were to remove any goods in his possession above the value of£60 without the leave of the Official Receiver or trustee, he would be liable to arrest and to have all his books and so on, seized.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of the value of goods—goods to the value cf£60 amount to almost nothing today—I wonder whether the Minister can tell us something that I was unable in the time at my disposal to ascertain;namely, when the figure of£5 was introduced. I cannot help feeling that it must have been long before the 1914 Act, but the Debtors Act 1869 was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act. It is not easy to trace the figure back beyond that SLR Act, but I cannot help feeling that£5 must go back a long way. Therefore, even if one looks at it as a mathematicalfigure, one realises that just multiplying it by 12 is not enough to bring it up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another consideration. There are some things in respect of which values have risen less rapidly than have the values of others. The sort of goods that a bankrupt may have are personal goods and possessions. They are the sorts of things that have risen most steeply in value, so multiplying by 12 is not enough to bring the figure into line with reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of tabling the amendment is to express the view that even raising the limit to£60 is insufficient. it is too harsh on the debtor to be liable to those penalties if he removes goods to the value of£60 without leave. I pause long enough to point out that this is an absolute liability. There is no question of any intenticn having to be proved. If he does remove those goods, even unwittingly, these processes may be set in motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I daresay that if those concerned with putting those processes into motion discovered that the person was acting unwittingly they would not set them into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
motion. I have no particular experience of proceedings under this subsection but in other fields one has seen how, when somebody has felt that he has to move quickly instead of taking time to make inquiries, he has started up the processes, and once they are started it is difficult to bring them to an end. It probably would not have happened if there had been more time to consider the matter. It is possible that that could happen here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, our view is that to bring the figure in this subsection up to£60 isnot enough. It still places too heavy a risk on debtors acting unwittingly. It should be raised to at least£120, and my personal inclination is to round it up to£200.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. and learned Friend on the amendment which the Committee is considering. I should perhaps start by telling the Committee that when I was appointed to be a member of the Standing Committee to consider this Bill my joy was somewhat contained because, as a non-lawyer, I felt that I should be spending many mornings discussing the minutiae of a Bill which was only of the most passing interest to me. I am bound to tell the Committee, however, that as I hear the proceedings develop I am coming to believe that weare dealing with a matter which is not only of the greatest importance, not least for those who may have to use the provisions of the Bill, but of the widest interest. When we shake the kaleidoscope of a fairly straightforward—some would say dull-asditchwater—amendment which simply says "for 60 read 120", we fail to recognise that underlying this and many other amendments is a vast area which is ripe for consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to touch on a specific point which follows upon what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) said, and then to conclude with a general observation aboutthe amendment itself and its relationship to the whole matter which we are to discuss on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend told the Committee what the amendment refers
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
to, and he did a service by reminding us that the interest of the debtor is not being overlooked in our consideration of this legislation. The fact that the amendment relates to books, papers and personal effects in the possession of the debtor causes us to reflect that whereas it may seem an enormous jump to go from£5 to£60, and that by any reckoning 1,200 per cent. appears to be a large multiple, we are overlooking the fact that£5 may notitself relate to the figure introduced in 1914, but possibly to an earlier period. Perhaps theUnder-Secretary of State will confirm that. Also, we have to take note of the fact that in hardly any area has inflation been more rampant than it has in relation to personal effects—books and papers of the sort to which this section of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take note of that fact, we realise that it is not enough to stand aghast at an increaseof 1,200 percent., but that we have to ask ourselves just how far£60 would go today inthe purchase of the personal effects to which we refer. Like my hon. and learned Friend, Iam not a slave of£120. I, too, support the idea of a nice, round figure, and perhaps something substantially higher would be more appropriate, but the point of principle to which we are right to draw attention is that£60, seeming to be a large multiple, is, in the reality of 1976, inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by broadening the question a little but still relating it to the amendment under discussion. As I address my attention to succeeding amendments, which seem merely to contain the suggestion that for one figure we put in another, I believe that we are seeing revealed the need for a comprehensive review leading not just to the Bill which we are discussing, but perhaps to one embodying many more substantial amendments—not just to the figures contained in some former statutes, but to the detail—to bring the whole practice much more into line with the facts of 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could lead one to the conclusion that we should leave everything exactly as it is, either in the form of statutes, or exactly as the Government are proposing, being reasonable multiples of the figures in the statutes, but there are some things which are too important to await such a general view which, by the admission of the Minister himself, is not likely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
to take place for a considerable time. I suggest that on this amendment we cannot allow the Government to get away with the figure of£60 on the basis of it being a substantial multiple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask the Minister to look not only at the multiples of the original figure, but to see whatthe new figure suggested in the Bill would buy in 1976. I respectfully suggest that if he didthat he would come to a figure substantially closer to that in the amendment moved by my hon. and learned Friend than that contained in Schedule 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from pressing the Government in the way suggested by my hon. Friend bysaying that we should not allow them to get away with the proposal, I think that in this casethe Government should think again. Let me quote a few figures to illustrate changes in pricesof ordinary office equipment. Recently, I saw that a reconditioned typewriter cost£75. At the weekend, in one of the colour supplements I saw an advertisement for what was described as the cheapest new standard typewriter on the market, at a cost of just under£99. A box file, which I used to be able to buy for about 10s. in former currency, is now selling for about£5 or£5.50. These are the changes in modest personal equipment in an office, and in the light of such prices the Government should look at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main points made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) was that the wording in the Bill looks innocuous and one has to go back to the underlying legislation to see what is involved. It is then that one realises that the penalties are Draconian indeed. As you will know, Mr. English, this goes back to the danger of legislation by reference, which was spelt out so well in the report of the Committee under the chairmanship of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Huntingdonshire (Sir D. Renton). Until we get away from this degree of legislation by reference, this sort of omissionand concealment of the real penalty that lies behind the Bill will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) said, that the more one gets into the Bill, the more one wonders
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
whether it is appropriate to bring forward these minor amendments, these tinkerings with the nuts and bolts of the engine, when it is the engine itself that badly needs an overhaul and consolidation to bring it up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every time the Under-Secretary says there will be a major review of the bankruptcy laws some time in the future that is fine as far as it goes, but in the meantime we are passing minor amendments to an Act that is now very much out of date. One wonders, therefore, whether it is appropriate to tackle the subject in this manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To follow the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Sir R. Gower) about the risein values and costs since 1914, what was the intention behind the legislators of the time in 1914 when they put in the£5 limit, assuming that it came into the 1914 Act for the first time? The Under-Secretary may tell us that it has been there since the nineteenth century, but let us assume that it came in in 1914. Presumably, it was the intention that someone who had got himself into difficulties should be able to carry away enough of his worldly goods tokeep himself going without real distress. This would, presumably, refer particularly to clothes and household goods, and therefore I assume that at that time there was a relationship between the cost of such basic articles as clothing and the level of the average wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reasonable to assume that the average wage at the time was about 25s or 30s per week. The legislators in 1914 felt that if they enabled someone to carry off with him goods worth upto four times his weekly wage, at least he would not become completely destitute and he and his family would not have to go straight to the poor house. As we all know, the average industrial wage today is about£50 to£60 gross. I submit, therefore, that all that theGovernment are doing in their amendment is enabling someone to take away goods that approximate to a multiple of one only of his average weekly wage, as opposed to the multiple of approximately four that must have existed in 1914 when this legislation was originally written. On that basis, the appropriate figure today would be£200£250.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My major concern is not with the level of the figure—although I accept the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
amendment moved by my hon. and learned Friend—but with the basic principle behind it, namely, that people will generally not know the penalty to which this legislation refers. This is a serious gap, and I would far rather see this matter dealt with in consolidated legislation in which the penalty itself is reviewed, rather than just have the figure stated and leave open the question whether, if one goes over a certain figure, one is subject to arrest. Itis to the question whether the penalty of arrest in these circumstances, tied to this limit, is correct that we should be bending our minds, rather than to a figure of£150 or£200.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment has led to an interesting debate, and perhaps I may deal initially with the somewhat peripheral points and then get on to the substance of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of legislation by reference, I do not know how else the matter could have been dealt with. If hon. Gentlemen ponder on that, they will agree that all statutory instruments are legislation by reference. That may be bad in some respects, but it is difficult to conceive of an alternative when dealing with matters of this kind. It is incumbent on legislatorsto look at the source of the legislation, and clearly they have done that, so we now come to the worthwhile arguments which we have heard from hon. Gentlemen this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let me make an observation which is not intended in any sense to be spiteful or malevolent. I sense that the Opposition have shifted their ground perceptibly from the early days of the Committee's proceedings, when I was told that we had shifted the balance so unfairly against the creditor. This morning the social problems of the debtor have been represented to the Committee. I do not grumble about that. It is right that the Committee should consider these difficult matters in that way. However, while it is right that some minimal relief should be afforded to a bankrupt or to a debtor in respect of the serious consequences and inconvenience caused by bankruptcy, the object must, nevertheless, be to deter the bankrupt from defeating the justifiable claims of his creditors. The Committee would be ill-adivsed to omit that considertion from its deliberations this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
The second relevant point is that when the debtor gets into this sort of difficulty the consultative processes available to him are well known. He has explained to him the Position of the trustee and Official Receiver. He is encouraged to consult, the benefits of constultation are made adundantly plain, and therefore the maxim that might be applied is, " Do not do anything without the advice or, where necessary, the leave of the Official Receiver or the trustee."
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is submitted to the Committee that the figure of£120 is not magical, it is not oneto which the Opposition attach significant importance, and they are not sure what figure it ought to be. None of us can be sure, when considering all these matters, that the right solutions have been reached, and I suspect that if we enter into further consultation we shall not be sure at the end of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I considered the situation with some care before the debate began, and none of the arguments that have been adduced is fresh to me. I am not suggesting that they are all stale. Indeed, nothing coming from the lips of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) could be stale. But he has been my most ardent supporter on a number of other Bills, so I must not say that. We must, however, apply the basic considerations which I put to the Committee a moment ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not here talking of sanctions under the criminal law. This is arrest through the process of the bankruptcy court. The social consequences of arrest, while of course being most unpleasant, have not the long-term consequences of a conviction. It does not count against the record of somebody in the way that a conviction does, and that is a material factor when we are looking at this position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked about the origin of the figure of£5. I believe that it goes back tothe 1883 Bankruptcy Act. It could conceivably go back to 1861, but is not likely to go back much beyond that. The Committee might like to take into account that the value of today's pound, relating it to 1861, is 9p. Related to 1883 its value is 81/2p, but in 1914 there was no change from that, and it is, therefore, fair, if one is to apply the multiplier, to apply the multiplier as at 1914, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
there is no perceptible difference. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are saying that we should not apply the multiplier, but should take into account the other arguments which they have put forward. I do not agree with that, because one has to take into account the need to deter a debtor from behaving in a way that will be prejudicial to the interests of the creditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a simple way of dealing with this. It is not a question of a debtor suddenly taking his goods and disappearing. He has had the opportunity for consultation. He has been briefed, so to speak, by the Official Receiver and by the trustee. He knows what the rules are. It is not something that just falls upon him. Therefore, I think that there is not a case here for the wide-scale review to which reference has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one more point in response to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton). I hope thathe is not seriously suggesting that we have engaged on an attempt to conceal the effects of this provision. There is no intention to conceal, and it would have been unworthy of me to have tried to do so—not only unworthy, but extremely foolish, because hon. Members have the right and the capacity to see what is the source of all this. There is a strong case for leaving it at £60, and I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for those expressions of views. I am sorry that I cannot go further in this instance and support them to the degree that I did last time, but I shall limit my references to them to two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the point raised by my hon. Friends about legislation by reference. He said that there is a great deal of it, and that even statutory instruments are legislationby reference. We can all agree to the first of those propositions. Of course there is a good deal of legislation by reference—far too much—but that does not get us anywhere I am not sure that I follow the hon. Gentleman's point that statutory instruments are legislation by reference. That would not make them either good or bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we want to achieve is the situation in which the public possibly, certainly Members of this House, can look at a Bill or a draft statutory instru
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
ment and see what it means. That is the evil to which my hon. Friends are referring—that one can look at this for as long as one likes and not have any idea of what it meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that on some points legislation by reference may be inevitable, and sometimes perfectly acceptable. I remember that the Senior Parliamentary Counsel once gave this example: if there is a railway timetable which for Sunday trains says As for Saturday, except for the 9.10 ", that is legislation by reference, but very sensible. There one can see in the shortest possible form exactly what the position is. The complaint we raise about this kind of legislation is that it is so difficult to see what it means. It is a general point, and one on which I would have hoped there would be agreement thoughout the Committee to this extent at least, that it is something that should be avoided wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then suggested that we had shifted our ground. It is really a case of the pot calling the kettle black. He has been telling us all the things that the Government propose to do to deter creditors from using bankruptcy, and now he is saying that these provisionsare to deter debtors. Our position is clear. The Government, by increasing the figures upon which a petition may be founded, are limiting the availability of the remedy of bankruptcy to creditors. We accept that the figure should be raised, and that should be some such limitation, but our point is purely and simply that the limitation has been too great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said from the beginning that we do not merely recognise, but assert, the necessity tomaintain a balance between creditor and debtor, and in these amendments we turn to the position of the debtor. What we are saying here is that we agree with the proposition that the conditions of bankruptcy should be sufficiently stringent to ensure that it is a worth while remedy. I prefer to put it that way, rather than to put it in terms of deterring the bankrupt from doing this, that and the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that when one has taken bankruptcy proceedings the rules provide adequate safeguards to make sure that all the assets are not made off with. We accept that, but there is the further factor
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
in the equation—I should not have thought that anyone would have quarrelled with this analysis—that we must not go to the extent of making the provisions too rigorous, or more rigorous than are reasonable from the point of view of the debtor as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point here is that we are dealing in Section 23 with an extreme remedy—arrest. It is true that it is not arrest for a criminal offence, but I do not think that I quite understand the hon. Gentleman's point that it matters less if one is arrested under this section. I should have thought that, so far as the general public are concerned, the fact that somebody is arrested, whatever the basis of the arrest, is the greatest possible restriction of individual liberty and therefore of enormous importance from that point of view. From the point of view of public stigma it may be that much less, but I should have thought that it was still aconsiderable stigma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the point I was seeking to make was that the longterm consequences as far as public stigma are concerned are appreciably less. It has a Draconian effect in the first place, and if it were widely known there might be a public stigma for a fairly short time, but it does not represent a stain on a man's character, as one normally understands that term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content to put it this way, and the Minister will probably agree, that it is a very nasty thing to happen to anybody, both from his personal point of view and from thepoint of view of his reputation amongst his friends and relatives. It is a nasty thing to have happen. Therefore, although we are not saying that this provision should be available to meet the case where somebody is trying to make off with goods and therefore defeat his creditors, we are saying that it should be available only in circumstances which one can say are reasonable, having regard to everybody's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining point which the Minister made and on which I should comment was that these powers were not likely to be used because there is plenty of opportunity for consultation in the bankruptcy process. I think he is right about that. That is one of the good
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
things about it. That is why it is so much better than the administration order proceedings, because in bankruptcy proceedings the organisation is there, the habits are there, the customs and practices that have been built up, and they are very good. But it does not alter the fact that there are occasions when these powers may be used; otherwise, we might as well scrub them altogether. What we have to do is try to ensure that the basis upon which they may be used, is reasonable to all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were there any consultations about this figure before the Bill was presented? If so, what representations were received. and from whom? I should be pleased if the Minister would answer those questions and add anything that he can on the various points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not do it immediately, in case the Minister wants to add something, but I propose, with the leave of the Committee, to ask to withdraw the amendment. It was a probing amendment, and the Minister has said some things about which we want to think. We venture to hope that he will think about the things that we have said and thus leave the way open for the future and, in particular, for further discussions between us or for him to communicate to us such further thoughts as he may have.

	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
All the preliminary observations that I made on the last amendment apply equally to this one. I shall not repeat them, but will come straight to the point to which those preliminary observations led me—namely, to draw the Committee's attention to the provision which it is proposed to amend. In this case, line 39 of the first schedule puts forward amendments to Section 38(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914. We do not quarrel with the purpose of that amendment, which substantially increases the figure in that subsection, but we think that it has not been sufficiently increased so our amendment proposes to make it even higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 38 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The property of the bankrupt divisible amongst his creditors, and in this Act referred to as the property of the bankrupt, shall not comprise the following particulars".</p></blockquote>
The last amendment related to the removal of goods. This is not the same thing. It excludes certain goods from the property available to creditors anyway, so that these excluded goods may be dealt with by the bankrupt as he wishes. This is of enormous importance to the bankrupt, and of great importance to the creditor. What we are trying to do here, as in all other instances, is to hold the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is excluded from the property of the bankrupt by reason of Section 38(2) are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The tools (if any) of his trade and the necessary wearing apparel and bedding of himself, his wife and children, to a value, inclusive of tools and apparel and bedding, not exceeding twenty pounds in the whole".</p></blockquote>
It is proposed in Schedule 1 that that£20 should be increased to£250. It is proposed in our Amendment No. 23 that it should be increased from£20 to£500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Committee has to consider is what items are comprised in the figure, whatever it may be in the end. It is the value of
	<br><blockquote><p>"The tools (if any) of his trade and the necessary wearing apparel and bedding of himself, his wife and children … inclusive of tools and apparel and bedding, not exceeding twenty pounds in the whole".</p></blockquote>
I do not know when that figure of £20 was introduced, but I do know that I hope to hear this matter developed by my hon. Friends who have practical experience in the different fields that are relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about tools of trade, does my hon. and learned Friend not agree that some tools of trade in 1976 comprise instruments of an extremely expensive nature? The figure in the schedule could well be eaten up by that item, and that is before one gives any consideration to clothing or bedding. Even the£500 proposed in the amendment seems, on the face of it, to be particularly low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I had got as far in the sentence as what I do know. What I was about to say was very much in line with what my hon. Friends then said. I was about to say that I feel strongly that£250 cannot be enough to cover those items, for a variety of reasons. The first is the very good point made by my hon. Friend, a practical one which I hope that he and other lay members of the
Committee will develop. Whereas the tools which a man might need for his trade at whatever date this figure was fixed, may have been fairly few and unsophisticated, as my hon. Friend so rightly says, the essential minimum tools for a man now may of themselves far exceed either the£250 or the£500 which are the two figures before the Committee, the£250 being the figure in the schedule and the£500 that we suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that my hon. Friend will think that there is now a case for taking tools of the trade right out of this figure, saying simply that tools of the trade are not within the property divisible, and then perhaps putting some limitation on it. I should like to hear this from the Minister. I should say that this is essentially a matter on which we should like to know the views of the trade unions, and particularly the craft unions where if a man is to do his work, he must have a set of tools of his own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first item of tools of the trade, it seems to us, and even to a lawyer, that£250 or even£500 may not be enough to cover even the basic tools necessary for a man to earn his living. My two specific points are these. First, is it not time to consider a different approach to that, excluding tools altogether, subject possibly to some qualifications to ensure that there is no deliberate evasion? Secondly, what is the view of the trade unions on this and, in particular, what are the views of the craft unions whose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
members will be particularly affected by this provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One then comes to the other items,
	<br><blockquote><p>"wearing apparel and bedding of himself, his wife and children".</p></blockquote>
What wearing apparel and bedding for a man, his wife and children could be covered by£250? This makes nonsense of what we are doing. We are trying to increase these figures to introduce some air of reality and, if possible, to make the figures represent reality, not merely now but for a year or two. Although everyone talks about a wide-ranging review—my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) stressed it again today, and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) has stressed the need for this—and although since 1920, or the early 1920s, the need for that comprehensive review has been accepted by all and there have in fact been three comprehensive reviews at the behest of the Government. the two 1920 committees and the Blagden Committee, nothing has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, there has been a comprehensive review by the Justice Committee and its observations were not even taken into account in putting forward the Bill, nor was it consulted about these provisions. I think it would therefore be optimistic to expect that there will be any comprehensive or far-reaching review, or at least any action upon it, within the next few years. So while we are putting these figures up, we should not be hidebound by mathematical calculations that might just bring them up to the sort cf figure that would be realistic today, even if that were right. Even if the Government's present figures about inflation are right, they will be out of date within a year or two. We are only asking the Government to be practical about these figures. Of course a figure of £250 would deter, but let us consider the way in which it would deter. " Deter " is not the right word. It would reduce a bankrupt to being able to retain only such amount of tools, bedding and wearing apparel as may, on the simplest of tests, be far below his minimum needs and might have the result of making it that much more difficult for him to go on earning money and pay off his debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
I would mention to my hon. Friends and the Committee that what is in question in this section is not merely the humanitarian approach of not stripping someone of everything, but also the practical approach of leaving him in a position where he can go on earning money to pay off his debts. I suggest that even the figure to which the Government proposed to raise the figure in this section is not enough to do justice to either of those needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more we study the wording that lies behind these clauses and go back to the 1914 Act, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) has once again done, the more it strikes us that we are trying to amend Acts that refer to totally different social conditions from those in which we are now living. The language which is brought back to us by the 1914 Act is the language of Newgate, of the Debtors' Prison, of totally different social circumstances. This reinforces the difficulty of trying to amend the Act by simply updating the limit figures in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could refer immediately to one obvious injustice in this amendment seeking to increase from£20 to£250, as suggested by the Government, or to£500 as suggested by my hon. Friends. This covers necessary wearing apparel and bedding of wife and children. I have five children, and my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) has only two. Is it right that the same limit should be applied to us both, when clearly in these circumstances I shall have to look after, clothe, feed and keep warm six people and my hon. Friend will have to clothe, feed and keep warm only three people? This is the sort of anomaly that arises on these limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that one of the most interesting passages in the Under-Secretary's last reply to the previous amendment was when he told us that the pound today equated back to the worth of 9p in 1861—I hope that is the right date-8½p in 1880, and 8½p again in 1914. This emphasises the total security of money in the latter days of the Victorian age—how very well our grandfathers and great-grandfathers looked after us and how totally secure was money considered when it was invested in the Funds at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
How very different the situation is today. One wonders therefore, in approaching these limits, and being conscious, as my hon. and learned Friend said, that the likelihood that the consolidation measure on bankruptcy will actually come forward within the next few years is very remote, whether the proper approach to reconsidering these limits would in fact not be to index them in some way. Possibly we could tie them to the retail price index so that if and as inflation continues, perhaps at the more modest rate of 10 per cent. per annum, at least these limits should be adjusted upwards, because if they are not, and if we do not have amending legislation again within, say, five years, these limits will once again be totally out of date, at the rate of inflation from which we are suffering under the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to come back to the question of tools of trade. Clearly, when this was written into the 1914 Act, the legislators of the day had in mind fairly modest tools, which as my hon. and learned Friend said were necessary for the debtor to continue to win his livelihood, to continue to earn his wage, and thus to have the ability to pay off his debts, which must be the wish of everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens today, for example to the salesman whose livelihood depends on having a motor car? This is his only trade, and he cannot ply his trade without a motor car. Any second-hand motor car that has to do a lot of mileage today will be worth at least several hundred pounds. He does not even have to be a salesman to have to have a motor car. He may be living some way out from an industrial town and have to have a motor car in order to get in to the factory where he has his job. If that motor car is taken away from him, he will not be able to get to his place of work, he will lose his job, and his ability to pay off his debts will disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the figure of£250 could not possibly encompass a second-hand motor car as well as all these other items covered in this subsection. I would have thought, therefore, that it was realistic for a subdivision to be attempted and for tools of trade to be at a larger figure, provided that the debtor could convince the Official
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
Receiver that the tools of trade were necessary for continuing in his business. Obviously conditions here may vary greatly, and a figure of, say,£1,000, which may be appropriate to the salesman living out in the country with the need to get into the town to ply his trade, will be very different from the figure appropriate for someone living in the heart of an industrial city, who might need only£200 or£250.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for a subdivision here on tools of trade, and, I submit, a larger but separate limit on the question of wearing apparel and of bedding. Above all, I should like to hear in reply from the Under-Secretary what he thinks about, and whether he would accept, the principle of indexing for these figures so that in inflationary times they should be kept up to the genuine needs of the debtor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would have thought, from listening to the hon. Gentleman, that this was a terribly serious problem which has suddenly given rise to the most serious social problems. This is very old law. What we are doing is, as I have repeatedly said, to restore the value of the monetary limits because the Bill has a narrow compass. The very fact that we have a Second Reading Committee procedure indicates the relevance of what I have just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is, in practice the figure of£20 is not strictly adhered to. I quote here from Williams on Bankruptcy, page 306.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"In practice the figure of£20 is not strictly adhered to. If the bankrupt has tools, clothing etc., to the value of more than£20, or some part of which is, by reason of his having several similar articles, unnecessary, there appears to be no procedure for determining which articles he is to keep."</p></blockquote>
That is a matter, therefore, which needs study, and is appropriate for the wider review—for which I am not prepared to fix the time limit, as I was, I think, being encouraged to do in earlier observations I heard before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Williams on Bankruptcy goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This exception is intended for the protection of workmen so that they may not be prevented from earning a livelihood; it does not include documents, even if used by the bankrupt in his business; but it would presumably include a writer's typewriter or dictating machine. Whether artificial aids to the natural faculties, such as spectacles, false teeth, etc., are ' wearing apparel 	<i>quaere;</i> in the case pf gold teeth, the point might be material."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
What this means is that the Official Receiver exercises a substantial area of discretion. He is there, not to make life absolutely intolerable for the bankrupt, but to ensure that there is a measure of fair play for the creditor. It is right that we should stress the interests of maintaining the balance between the debtor and the creditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) asked me whether the trade unions had been consulted. It is very refreshing for him, of all people, to suggest that the trade unions should be consulted in every possible respect. It was not always his view. It certainly was not always the view of his Government. However, I must not be deflected by some of the observations from the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) to vent my spleen on the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that we have had no communications from the trade unions about this matter. This indicates that, if this had been a serious social problem, affecting a substantial number of work-people, and if they had been prejudiced in the way that was being outlined to the Committee, I am certain that we should have had the strongest representation from the trade union movement, but none has been forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I want to make to the hon. and learned Gentleman in particular, but also to his supporters, is that we cannot divorce the problem that we are considering on this amendment from that relating to the execution of a warrant of execution against a debtor's goods. The present limit there of exempted items is£50. That is fixed by the Protection from Execution (Prescribed Value) Order 1963. That was an order proposed by the Conservative Government of the time. They did not seem to take on board the points which have been made during the course of this Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore feel that so that the two things can at least be kept within measure-able relationship one with the other, the figure of£250 is an equitable amount as between the interests of the debtor and the creditor. We think, in fact, that the figure should be£240, applying the multiplier, but we have rounded it up to£250. It is higher than that applicable to goods which
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
are exempt from seizure by a bailiff or an officer executing a warrant of execution, as I have already indicated. To restore the value of the latter limit would require a new limit of £150, but it is not for me to deal with that. It must be for my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will just add in this regard that it is rare for those two limits to be kept in step, as was pointed out in a case in 1899, with which I will not trouble the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex. Those Victorian days obviously were days which he would rejoice to have back. Perhaps his father and grandfather were able to deal with the matter along the lines that he was suggesting, but I venture to think that that was not, is not, and cannot be, the view of the vast majority of people in this country. There was some stability about the pound but there was terrible instability about life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested the indexing of the figures. I must say that that is a bit rich. He was not here when the point was argued by his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke). It was an argument with which I had much sympathy, as I said earlier this morning. Though we are dealing now, not with criminality, but with something different, it was nevertheless necessary to have some certainty, something of which the debtor or bankrupt will be able to have some knowledge. If we are to index the figures, where will he stand? He will have no certainty about the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally fail to follow that argument. The Minister said that the Official Receiver uses his discretion in this matter. One of his arguments for not accepting the amendment is that he says that the Official Receiver does not keep to the present limit. I gather that that is what the Minister is saying, although the words in the Bill are "Maximum value".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was putting forward the principle of indexation—because I am not a believer in indexation as such—in the belief that the overall review of the Bankruptcy Acts would not happen within the next few years and that it would be necessary to keep the limits up to date in a highly inflationary period. Surely it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
possible for the Official Receiver to give guidance, to which the Under-Secretary has continually referred, to any bankrupt as to the current limit in any year and whether the RPI indexation were to apply. Therefore, to say that the bankrupt would not have certainty in this matter is nonsense, because guidance, and therefore certainty, could be given to him by the Official Receiver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Official Receiver would be in difficulties as well. However, leaving that aside, I am perfectly happy to see some reasonable flexibility in the situation. That is why I have proposed in Clause 1(2) that the Secretary of State should have power, by regulations, to
	<br><blockquote><p>"increase or further increase any of the sums specified in the provisions amended by subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
However, I am afraid that the Committee, in its wisdom—or lack of it—thought that that was an inappropriate way of proceeding with the matter. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. No doubt he will support me when I seek to reinstate that proposal in the Bill on Report. I look forward to that opportunity of welcoming him to the Division Lobby, because if he does not do that he will be in a position of great uncertainty himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the question of the tools of trade, there is a case for the consideration of this matter. However, I think hon. Gentlemen will agree that it is not right, within the narrow compass of the Bill, to go into these important issues of principle which require a far closer scrutiny and analysis than we are able to give them now. That is why we are having the wider review. If we did not do that, there would be no point in having the wider review. That review should be thorough, and it should go into the multiplicity of issues to which the hon. and learned Gentleman was seeking to direct us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman has said this several times in the course of these debates. The Committee should restrict itself at this stage to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, and I had made the point. I had hoped that it would not need reiteration, though evidently it does, Mr. English, but I take
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
your point. In all those circumstances, I hope that the Opposition will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some matters to which some observation by way of reply is necessary, though that does not apply to all the points made by the Minister. It is a little less than generous of him to single me out and regard it as especially surprising that it should come from me that there should be consultations with the trade unions. It seems that the Minister still shares the view that every Conservative is necessarily without any interest in the trade unions. Has he not woken up to the fact that we are well on into the twentieth century? I am happy to say that for many years I have had very good relations with many trade unionists, and I have not got them simply by doing what his Government do, which is agreeing with everything they say. The relationship is all the more valuable for that, I think, and the hon. Gentleman should be careful before letting slip snide and unconstructive remarks like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary referred to a warrant for possession. I am not going to say anything about that, because I am not conversant with the procedure to which he was referring. If necessary, I shall come back to him for further information later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister brushed aside what my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) said about the stability of money in the latter part of the nineteenth century. I hope that he will look again at his observations, because he did less than justice to the progress in other spheres which was made all through that quarter of a century whilst the value of money remained stationary, not least in the field of education, factory legislation, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to concentrate on two points which he made which went specifically to the amendment and to the provisions affected by it. The Minister said—as though this was a reason why we should not be too worried about these limits—that the Official Receiver exercises a wide discretion. He has no discretion. King Charles lost his head for dispensing with that. The Official Receiver has no discretion here. Of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
course he does turn a blind eye to the law, but I should not have thought any of us would regard that that was a good thing. Surely to goodness what we are concerned with here is to bring the figures up to date so that the law can be applied, not ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's main point was that the purpose of changing these figures is to restore the value of the monetary limits, but his argument here is superficial compared with the attention which he has given to previous figures which we discussed. Surely it is plain that, in this field about which we are now talking, it will not do just to talk about the difference in the value of money. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex started his observations by saying that we are now dealing with totally different social circumstances, and so we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing not only with totally different social circumstances, but also with totally different circumstances relating to the tools of trade. Whereas£20 may have been adequate to cover the tools which a man had to have to ply his trade when these provisions were introduced, and whereas it may be that£20 would be adequate in some cases now, it is plain that there are many instances now where it would not be within a mile of being adequate. Therefore, I urge upon the Minister reconsideration of the next point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex, which was that he should reconsider separating tools from the other items.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On listening to the discussion a point occurred to me which was not particularly in my mind at the beginning of the debate. I have just made it in outline. We have now reached the situation where one figure for tools does not make any sense, because the different tools which different men need for different occupations have such different values that to attempt to deal with the matter by way of a financial limit no longer makes sense. In some instances it will be far too high. and in others far too low. Therefore, I ask the Minister to tackle the matter by dealing with tools in a different way, perhaps with a maximum monetary limit, but possibly by leaving out the monetary limits and introducing different ways of arriving at the answer
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
as to what tools should be excepted, and then have a monetary limit for bedding, clothes and apparel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the wider review, since it may be referred to again on other amendments may we know at some stage how far that has progressed? When we started to consider the Bill it became clear that there had been no consultation with anyone outside the Department, even on the matters that are covered in the Bill. I do not believe that there has been any consultation on any of the other matters that are said to be the subject of the wider review. Since it may well be material to further amendments, and as it keeps cropping up as a reason why we should not deal with something now, may we know either now or the next time the subject crops up whether any and, if so what, progress is being made in connection with the wider review?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This being a probing amendment, I shall not advise my hon. Friends to vote on it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 24, in page 10, line 46, leave out '£600' and insert£1,000'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a shorter amendment, but it is not without interest, and I come straight to the provisions that are affected by it. They are the provisions of Section 50(3) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, which covers the situation where an incumbent has been declared bankrupt and the assets have been sequestrated, and the Door unfortunate curate has not had his pay for some time. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The sequestrator shall also pay out of the profits of the benefice the salary payable to any duly licensed curate of the church of the benefice in respect of duties performed by him as such during four months before the date of the receiving order, not exceeding fifty pounds."</p></blockquote>
It is proposed that that figure should be raised to£600. It may be that no curate earns more than£1,800 a year. If that is the case, this would cover his salary for four months. But if that is not the case, why on earth should a curate be in any worse position than any other employee? What we have done in the matter of preferences for wages—and this is another kind of preference in respect of wages—is to say that in the case of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
bankruptcy the wage earner shall have a preferential claim for up to£800; and in the case of company liquidation the employee, or the bank being subrogated to the ranks of the employee, shall have a preferential claim for£800. It was said that that was taking a rough stab at the whole thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that different considerations arise in the case of a company winding up, where there is the right of subrogation, and that the sensible thing was to round all the figures up to the same amount. In the amendment which we tabled, because we had to get something down Quickly and did not have as much time to consider these matters as we would have wished-—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:It may be of help to the Committee if I ask the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be very happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman, the Second Church Estates Commissioner, but to judge from the movement of his head it is clear that he does not wish to intervene. So be it. I am obliged to the Minister, because he must have realised that I was working round to that. The amendment proposed "for£600 read£1,000". I was explaining that this was a probing amendment and we have put down an alternative figure for consideration. I was about to suggest to him that there is no reason why it should not be the same as for all other workers. and that therefore we should like to see
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
the figure of £800. As the Ministert's undertaking to put down an amendment on Report will give effect to that, I shall be happy to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. Do I understand that the Minister has given such an undertaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give such an undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question has not been proposed, so the amendment falls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 25, in page 10, line 49, leave out ' £600 ' and insert£300'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Committee is not doing badly: in two out of four cases there will be changes. That is not a bad record for any Committee. I appreciate the Minister's approach to the last amendment, and I hope he will feel that similar constructive suggestions may be made about Amendment No. 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me adopt the same course as before and acquaint the Committee with the provisions to which the amendment relates. They are contained in Section 89(5) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914. Section 89 deals with payment of money into the Bank of England. I need not bother the Committee with the first four subsections, but come straight to subsection (5) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a trustee at any time retains for more than ten days a sum exceeding fifty pounds, or such other amount as the Board of Trade in any particular case authorise him to retain, then, unless he explains the retention to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade, he shall pay interest on the amount so retained in excess at the rate of twenty per centum per annum, and shall have no claim to remuneration. and may be removed from his office by the Board of Trade, and shall be liable to pay any expenses occasioned by reason of his default."</p></blockquote>
It is proposed to raise the amount which he may retain without incurring the consequences of Section 89(5) to the sum of £600. The purpose of the amendment is to reduce that sum to £300.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should it be necessary for the trustee to retain for more than 10 days more than£300 in cash? We have upped the figure of£50 to£600 by multiplying it by 12 without taking into account any of the other relevant considerations. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
do not know the date on which that figure of£50 was first introduced, but let us assume that it was in 1914. In 1914, the communications and banking systems in this country were quite different from what they are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One asks oneself why it is necessary for a trustee to keep in cash any substantial sum of money for any period. Presumably, all the sums of any size that he has to pay out will be paid by cheque. In order to do that he will have to put the money into the bank, and the sooner he puts it in, the better. What we are talking about today is simply what should be the cash float that he retains. That is not what they were talking about in 1914. They were talking about having regard to the situation then, the banking facilities all over the country, and so on, and what was a reasonable sum to retain for a period of more than 10 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it hard to see why it is necessary for a trustee to retain any substantial sums of money in cash other than simply as a float, and I should have thought that£300, as a float was a substantial sum, bearing in mind that he can keep any other sum for up to 10 days. All that we are talking about here is the amount that he must not keep for more than 10 days. If he wants a cash sum for any particular purpose, that is all right. If it is not more than £300 he should draw that, but not more than 10 days before he is required to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem that what we are proposing here would impose any restriction, limitation or difficulty upon a trustee. It may be that trustees have been asked what they think about it, but I anticipate that the Minister will say, that this is just a mathematical exercise. We are saying that this is another case where merely a mathematical exercise does not make much sense. It is not a big point. It does not take a long time to discuss it, but why would £300 not be a perfectly adequate cash float? Unless there is some reason why we should allow trustees to retain more than that, why not just accept this amendment as a useful change to the Bill and pass on to the next one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand how this provision got into the Bill. They may have thought that as they were increasing a number of other figures
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
to realistic, present-day values they should do the same thing here. On the whole, I am opposed to the Government's proposal and to our own amendment. I do not like either. I cannot see why a trustee should be encouraged to hold a lot of cash. I can see no reason for altering the original figure from what is was in 1914. He should be encouraged to put the money in the bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that extent, and with great diffidence, I tend to differ from my hon. and learned Friend. I hope that the Minister will reflect upon this. Is there any valid reason why the trustee should be encouraged to keep in his office, his pocket or his safe what is quite a substantial sum of money in contemporary terms? I cannot see any reason for it. It is convenient nowadays to bank money. There are branch banks in small towns, and there are numerous banking institutions including trustee banks, and so on. Perhaps some years ago other arguments could be addressed to this issue, but in today's situation the original wording is adequate and there is no reason why the figure should be stepped up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy for what my hon. Friend the Member for Barry (Sir R. Gower) has said. I should like the Under-Secretary to explain what the trustee does with the money during the period of 10 days in which he can, I gather, keep any sum of money, and with the larger sum that it is now proposed he should keep after the 10-day period. I do not follow why he should need to have such a substantial cash float. It may be that there is some factor of which I am unaware, in which case the Under-Secretary will explain it. Otherwise, my hon. Friend the Member for Barry is on the right track.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those of us who are involved with charities found that the treasurer had a cash float, or a sum of money of more than, say,£25, which he had not banked and therefore was not getting interest on it, we should tend to regard him as a bad treasurer, and we should encourage him to break down his cash float to see that more money was on deposit. After all, it can be on a demand basis so that even if it is in a deposit account he can get it within 24 hours should the need arise. Obviously, the wish of the trustee must be to maximise the amount of interest that he receives on the debtor's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
assets in order to pay the creditors the largest sum possible. Against that back- ground, it seems totally unnecessary for the sum of money to be increased so far, but perhaps there is some reason of which I am unaware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Mem- ber for Southport (Mr. Percival) was right to emphasise the much greater growth of banking facilities today compared with those that existed in 1914. It is not just a case of banking facilities. The trustee or his clerk can place the money on deposit in any post office in the land and get the benefit of interest, either from the Post Office Savings Bank, or with Giro. With the far greater extension of banking facilities and the ability to with- draw money from deposit on demand, the extension upwards seems unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wait to hear the Under-Secretary's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) said that some mathematical exercise has to be carried out, and that is quite right whether one applies£600 or£300. I submit that a figure of£600 is logical having regard to the points that I have made time and time again relating to the erosion of monetary values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limit was fixed at£50, and one does have to have regard to what it was worth then. I have had no representa- tions made to me about the proposal that we have made. If anybody within the profession had felt very strongly about it there would have been no difficulty on his part in making strong representations to me. We are talking about a matter of convenience. It is a question of col- lecting small debts. That is the point that we are seeking to try to resolve so far as the convenience of the trustee is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the Committee that we have only rarely had need to apply any of the sanctions that are refererd to in the Act, and we have had to threaten to use them only in a rare number of cases. There is not much of a danger here. We are talking about a maximum of£600, and therefore the maximisation of interest over the period concerned is relatively small. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an amazing statement. He
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
says that it is a question of convenience. For 10 days the trustee is at liberty to have these amounts, so presumably he will be walking around with his pockets bulging, or the money will be in a desk in his office at some risk and earning no interest. I cannot see what convenience is involved, when it easy for him to walk into a bank or a post office and deposit some of it. I cannot see why he has to have£600, or anything up to that sort of figure, just for convenience. It would be highly inconvenient to have that sort of money hanging around. With great respect, I cannot see anything convincing about that reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that no representations had been made to him. I am not a bit surprised, because everybody, including the hon. Gentleman and his advisers, are still being taken by surprise at how much is in the Bill and how much discussion is needed. It is not surprising that people did not know and that there were no representations beforehand. As far as I know, nobody was invited to make any. No draft Bill was circulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman must be fair. He knows perfectly well that I spent many hours with the professional interests most concerned with these matters. They did not make any representations on this issue, because it is a minuscule one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that there were no representations in those discussions, because I know that those concerned wanted to concentrate their attention on the major points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that it will not do for the Minister simply to say that the issue is a small one. Because it is a small one, we have taken very few minutes on it. Because it is a small one, it would be perfectly easy for him to agree with it. I think it is better, when a problem has been identified and a point of view aired, for a Committee not necessarily to try to reach a conclusion on it at that moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because it is a small point in the context of the whole Bill I shall not take any more time over it, save to urge upon the Minister his own argument. It is an argument that falls in a small compass. All the points of argument advanced in the Committee today have pointed in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
one direction. They have pointed to the Minister making some concession in our direction. In the hope that he may reconsider what he has said, and because we are not wedded to a figure of£300, or any other figure, I shall do what I have done before in the spirit in which I have done it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we come to Amendment No. 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will take even less time, because I have to say that at some stage some error has crept in here. As the amendment reads, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"leave out from beginning to end of line 41".</p></blockquote>
which would mean leaving out both the amendment to Section 223(a) and the amendment to Section 248(2). At no stage was it intended in one amendment to propose those two changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman carefully specify exactly what he is proposing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am proposing is not to propose anything. I was giving an explanation for saying that I propose not to move the amendment. If my shorthand was unintelligible, let me make it clear that that is what I was proposing to propose. The matter which gave rise to it was that we are concerned about the wording of the amendment to Section 223(a), but that is dealt with in another amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman cannot just stand up and make a speech to a non-existent amendment. If he subsequently wishes to withdraw the amendment, will he either propose the one on the amendment paper, or specify the one that he is proposing? He can then say what he likes to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You anticipated my last sentence, Mr. English, which was that I do not propose to move the amendment. That resolves all problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 34, in page 11, line 38, leave out:
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>'winding up on grounds of insolvency '</p></blockquote>
and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'service of statutory demand'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment proposed here is not an amendment to the figure. We have already dealt with that on another amendment that was discussed with the amendment to the amended sum for the minimum amount for a petition in bankruptcy. We are concerned here with the wording in column two. The wording as it stands, as the Committee will see, is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Minimum debt for winding up on grounds of insolvency."</p></blockquote>
Column two is an important column, because it is the only description which the reader of the Bill has of what is being done by a particular amendment set out in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most uninstructive in most cases, even where accurate. I do not complain about that, because I have already said it is inherent in this kind of legislation that a short description in a schedule like this may leave most people in total ignorance. But I think the Committee will agree that it is highly desirable that what is said should be accurate so that those who have some knowledge of the matter may be put on to the point that much the more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Line 38 proposes an amendment to Section 223(a) of the Companies Act 1948. Following my own advice to myself on previous amendments, I shall draw the attention of the Committee to the provisions of the subsection in question. Section 223 is part of that part of the Companies Act which deals with the circumstances in which a company may be wound up by the court. Section 223 is headed " Definition of inability to pay debts " and it starts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A company shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts "—</p></blockquote>
in any of the circumstances there set out. The first is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) if a creditor, by assignment or otherwise, to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding fifty pounds then due has served on the company, by leaving it at the registered office of the company, a demand under his hand requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for three weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor;"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
This is machinery devised to assist creditors. If they serve what is called a statutory demand and that demand is not complied with, the company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts and a petition for winding up may be presented. That is known in all circles where people are concerned with the practice of winding up as the statutory demand. It is, in fact, something quite different from insolvency, because it may happen that such a notice may be served and the company may fail to comply with that notice even though it is far from insolvent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I anticipate further arguments on this and say that I am prepared to accept the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I seem to have got it wrong. It is the proposal, not the amendment. We had better have a look at the amendment again. It is a little inelegant, but I shall accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is very elegant. It is elegant in the sense that it says in the minimum number of words exactly what it is desired to say in an intelligible form. But I shall not be ungracious about it. I shall not look this gift horse in the mouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 31, in page 12, line 37, leave out paragraph 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I twist my mind from one part of the schedule to another may I say that I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for the course that he has just taken, and also to the Law Society, the Bar Council, and the Joint Committee who put forward the amendment. I should not like it to be thought that I was so observant as to spot that one. It was worth spotting, and I am glad it has been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes to leave out paragraph 5 of Part II of the first Schedule of the transitional provisions, which appear on page 12. I should like some information from the Minister about how it works. Does it have the effect that if the sheriff or under-sheriff has sold goods before the Bill comes into effect the amounts of money which dictate his
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
course of action thereafter, or for the next 14 days, remain the same as if the Bill had not been passed, and the Bill applies only to sales made after this part of the Bill has come into effect? Is that how it works? Is that an adequate description of how it works in relation to companies, or is there some better and more succinct description?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether I am in order on the next question, because the provision about changing the sum by way of regulations has been taken out cf the Bill. The Minister has indicated that he intends to try to put it back, and the small point, which is much better referred to in Committee and which would arise if it were put back, is whether these transitional provisions would apply to further increases which were made by order under Clause 1 (2) if the subsection were still there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I want to move a motion in a moment or two and say something pertinent to it, I shall simply say that at our next sitting I shall deal with the points which the hon. and learned Gentleman has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the debate be adjourned.</p></blockquote>
I am in no way anxious to frustrate or truncate reasonable debate on the Bill. It is an important Bill in its own way, and it has been found to be deeply interesting by a number of members of this Committee. However, it is a Bill that was expected by the Opposition and by the Government not to take very long in Committee. I expected six sittings to be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It now appears, having completed Clause 1 but not yet finished the schedule, that we are almost there, but the progress that we have made is, to say the least, disappointing. A number of important issues will arise in consequence primarily of amendments that I shall propose later on, particularly in relation to questions of automatic discharge of bankrupts, and so on. I have tried to take those leading for the Opposition into my confidence as much as I can in terms of the time-scale and to consult with them about provisions of the Bill, but the progress is disappointing, and they have indicated that consideration of the Bill is likely to take considerably longer that I had anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
Bearing in mind that another Bill is in the pipeline—the Companies (No. 2) Bill—which will almost certainly engage the activities of a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and having regard to the fact that that is a 30-clause Bill which is subject to the same Second Reading Committee procedure I think that one should look at the situation as a whole. I therefore propose to ask the Committee, unless the most remarkable progress is made on Thursday, to consider sitting in the afternoons as from Tuesday of next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weatherill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Certainly not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition Whip who has just said, "No, certainly not," was one of those who thought that six sittings would be sufficient. If we sit in the afternoons we shall be able to acheive a reasonable time-scale. We shall not have any unnecessary or unreasonable truncating of debates. Therefore, the proposal which I have indicated—I am not making it yet—is reasonable in all the circumstances, and I hope that it will commend itself to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to have regard to the time-scale which is available to the Government for the Bill. We cannot have 12 or 15 sittings for this Bill, so that we have little or no hope of getting round to the Companies (No. 2) Bill, which is an equally significant measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would I. be in order, Mr. English—since it is nearly One o'clock—in asking you to extend the sitting for 10 minutes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a case of my willingness. I am not able to do so, because the Question before us is, That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned, and if that is not carried before one o'clock, I shall adjourn the Committee at One o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, this is a very important matter, and I shall have to gabble what I have to say, because I know that my hon. Friend wants to speak to it. My view is that as a result of what we have put forward, and because of the Minister's amendments, later in the Bill—provoked by us, by the Law Society and by 	<i>Justice—this</i> will end up a much
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
better Bill than it started. I hope that the Government will not grudge time which has those results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have now at last reached the amendments to Clause 6. We now have the opportunity to consider those and to come back to the Minister. I am sorry that he made the threats that he has, because it should now be possible to agree a course for the Bill in the light of the amendments that have been proposed. That is something which we have not been able to do before now. It is a pity that he did not come back to us on that before making these threats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my knowledge, nobody indicated that six sittings would be adequate. At the one meeting which we all attended we all expressed grave reservations about that. I shall not say any more, because I hope that we can have a discussion about the possible future course of the Bill in the light of the major amendments now tabled and I do not want to prejudice the possible outcome of those discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weatherill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my hon. and learned Friend in what he has just said. When I came into this room this morning, it was intimated to me by the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Coleman) that we might not sit on Thursday, but that we should sit instead on Tuesday afternoon. It is, therefore, with some astonishment that I now hear we are to sit on Thursday and on Tuesday afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, Mr. English, as you well know, these matters can be easily resolved through the usual channels, but I must protest that nobody has come to me as the Opposition Whip, to hear what view we take on the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is not present, and I have not been able to consult him. That being so, I do not think that it would be possible for us to do as the Minister suggests. We should discuss the matter through the usual channels and come to some sensible arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
