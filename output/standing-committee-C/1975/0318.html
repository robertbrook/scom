	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Yesterday I sought to amend my new Clause 14 by adding to subsection (4) the words:
	<br><q><p>"Provided that the tenancy of the eligible tenant may terminate at a later date than aforesaid by agreement of the landlord and tenant."</p></q>
Due to a mistake—I do not know on whose part—this has now been put down as new Clause 16. I hope that this can be corrected, because I understand that it is perfectly in order to amend one's own new clause if so desired.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have noted that. We have discussed new Clause 14, but it will be in order to discuss amendments to that clause when we reach it. I do not think we shall reach it today. It is probably in ordr then to discuss new Clause 16 although it is virtually new Clause 14 with an amendment. We shall meet the problem when we get to it, but I think I should give the Minister notice that it seems reasonable, in the circumstances, that any necessary discussion should take place on new Clause 16, but I shall reserve my judgment and wait till we reach it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment</i> (	<i>d</i>) 	<i>moved to the new</i> clause—[	<i>16th March</i>]—in line 4, leave out:
	<br><q><p>"(b) a brother or sister of the deceased; "[	<i>Mr. r. Jopling.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think you agreed, Mr. Costain, that we should take amendment (e) with this amendment. As I began by saying on Tuesday, the purpose of this amendment, which is the first of a number that we on this side have put down, is to try to lessen the impact that these new clauses will have upon the agricultural industry. The purpose of the amendment which I have moved is to leave out from the list of eligible persons a brother or sister of the deceased, and we also want to remove a person coming under subsection (1)(	<i>d</i>) and described as a treated child. It is true that the majority of speeches that we have had, which began with the Second Reading on 1st December, including speeches from the Government side, have referred in most cases, probably in shorthand terms, to the tenant's son or the son of a deceased farmer. Of course, I know that that has not happened on all occasions, but it is the son, in particular, who has been in our minds. He comes under subsection (1)(	<i>c</i>) and naturally we are not proposing to take that out. Neither are we proposing to change the position of the remaining, spouse, but, in passing, it might be as well to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, to tell us that paragraph (	<i>a</i>), which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>855</span>
covers the wife or husband, would apply only to a wife or husband existing at the time of death, by which I mean that a divorced wife or husband would not come within this category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we believe that it would be wise to leave out from this definition a brother or sister, or a treated child. There is a good case for leaving out a brother or a sister, because if they could qualify it would lead to a serious anomaly. If there were a situation where a tenant aged 60 died, and he had a son of 20—not an impossible situation—and also had a brother who lived with him on the farm, the brother could succeed to the tenancy if paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is left in and would continue to farm with the son of the deceased brother remaining with him. We could get into a situation where the son of the deceased tenant would have absolutely no standing when his uncle died. It is possible that the son of the uncle, the young man's cousin, could then inherit the tenancy, and his cousin, the son of the previous deceased tenant, would have absolutely no standing at all. Therefore, it is a major confusion to bring in the brother or sister, and it is widening the situation much more than is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is tempted to say that the succcssion of the brother is something which clearly would have been considered by the landlord when the farm was originelly let, and it would seem apparent that at that time the landlord was reluctant to let the brother have the tenancy. There might have been very good reasons why the brother was not given the tenancy, and it is not our business to extend it to a brother or a sister in a way which the landlord had evidently not wanted when the farm was originally let.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now turn to paragraph (	<i>d</i>), which we are considering with this amendment. I imagine that its purpose is to include an adopted child, and with that I would not choose to argue; it is right that an adopted child should be treated in the same way as a child under paragraph (	<i>c</i>): but I am not too sure about the legal situation, and no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to tell us whether an adopted child comes within the definition of " a child of the deceased " in paragraph (	<i>c</i>). Certainly, I would not be averse to an amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>856</span>
being made to paragraph (	<i>c</i>), to say that a child may be an adopted child of the deceased, but paragraph (	<i>d</i>) puts us into all kinds of situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may suggest a somewhat bizarre example which would be included. I know of some cases in the north of England where, during the war, girls of the Women's Land Army went to live and work on farms. They went at an early age soon after leaving school and they lived with the family. Some stayed on after the war, and to this day they continue to live on those farms. I should have thought that, if someone wanted to argue about it, a land girl could be included in paragraph (	<i>d</i>). I do not think it is our business to extend the scope of the law so that a girl who had worked on a farm could inherit the tenancy. We are getting into the realms of an amendment which we shall be discussing, next, which has been put down by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), on the position of farm workers. I shall not trespass on that, except to say that I do not think this would be a wise addition to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) could lead to a number of abuses. It is not impossible that a tenant who had no children but wanted to do a favour for a young man could make an arrangement with the young man's parents to treat him as a child of the family. I do not understand the meaning of the phrase:
	<br><q><p>"was treated by lhe deceased as a child of the family".</p></q>
I should have thought it was not impossible for a young person to be treated as a child of the family by a kind of manipulation, in order for that person to inherit a ttenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not forget that, if what I am suggesting is possible, there is a great deal of financial gain for a young person if he can get himself regarded as being treated as a child of the family. We are talking about something which is worth very many thousands of pounds to any person who finds himself in the fortunate position of being able to inherit a tenancy under the provisions of this clause. That is why, when we debated these matters on the Floor of the House last week, some of us expressed our amazement that the Labour Party should be proposing a new system of law which gives to families a near right of inheritance, which is worth a very large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>857</span>
amount of money indeed. If the provisions of this clause pas into law as they are now there will be a great deal of thought given to how people can work themselves into positions where they are able to inherit these tenancies. I predict that in some cases there will be just as much thought given to that as is given to ways of lessening people's liability to taxation. I am most concerned that the definition " treated as a child of the family " could lead to the most serious abuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall have a good deal more to say about this when we reach the next amendment, because it becomes much more apparent there, but those are the reasons why we on this side believe that the provisions of subsection (1) are too wide. We are not arguing about the eligibility being extended to the child, provided that that embraces an adopted child—which I am sure is right—and also the wife or husband of the deceased, but to extend it further, to the brother or sister, or to a treated child, is wrong and ought to be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support the amendments. It appears that in this case we have out-Celted the Celts if we can define it like this. I understand that the Scottish legislation about which we have heard all too much in the course of this Standing Committee does not include the brother and sister. If I am wrong about that I must be corrected. I am not quite sure why south of Hadrian's Wall we have got to make provision as widespread as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be serious, the object of what we are all trying to do is to avoid hardship, and all of the representations that have been made—by the National Farmers' Union. by the Young Farmers, all the other bodies—have accepted that the Government's object is to allow children, and, of course, the spouse as well, to have the opportunity to carry on the tenancy. It is immensely important that there should he no uncertainty. I suggest that both paragraph (	<i>b</i>), about the brother and sister, and paragraph (	<i>d</i>), about the child of the family, produce uncertainty, which will cause trouble. People can always produce odd cases which they can say are terribly hard—the brother farming in a partnership,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>858</span>
the person living in the family, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hardly dare use again the expression that hard cases make bad law, but in this instance it is terribly true. The important thing is certainty. If people in these categories feel there is a chance to inherit a tenancy and they are turned down by the ALT the position becomes far worse. I hope it may be possible to have another look at this, particularly the case of the brother and sister where, as I have said, we are going out on a limb in relation to the present Scottish law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for not hearing the whole of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) I do not think the points I am raising were all covered by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has argued many times that the Government have responded to a request by the NFU for this legislation. It is not within my knowledge that the Farmers' Union requested the inclusion of the persons specified in either paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) or (	<i>d</i>) in this new Clause 8 as suitable people for the passing on of tenancies under this new clause. If that is not the case perhaps the Minister can tell the Committee who thought up these proposals. I assume there must be some reason why brothers and sisters should he included. In a way, I am sorry that these two amendments were coupled together although I am sure, Mr. Costain, that you will allow separate Divisions on them. The subjects of the two amendments are slightly different judicially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone can decide who is a brother or a sister and there is a mass of case history of disputes about that matter. A case has been going through the House of Lords on this similar sort of thing recently. I have never seen a phrase more designed to give the lawyers heart and to ensure perpetual litigation than this in paragraph (	<i>d</i>):
	<br><q><p>"… was treated by the deceased as a child of the family in relation to that marriage".</p></q>
I can see the most splendid unions being proposed, on a pay basis even, if necessary, to ensure that paragraph (	<i>d</i>) can he brought into operation before—of all courts—the Agricultural Land Tribunal. A more mind-boggling thought scarcely has arisen in the annals of the judicial system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see a marriage being arranged.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>859</span>
Mrs. Bloggins has a fine young son and is quite prepared to give a handsome gift to a tenant in his 80s if he will do her the honour of becoming his wife so that a marriage can be established and this fine strapping young son can be treated as a child of the family in relation to that marriage. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman who interrupts from a sedentary position should read carefully paragraph (	<i>d</i>). Even in Scotland they have not gone as far as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always all agree that we have a substantial duty not to pass mumbo jumbo and not to pass legislation which is bound to increase lawyers' bank balances, bound to be the subject of constant dispute and, above all, is not fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not follow the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) about hardship. I believe that the hardship is a difficult thing to prove although I will have more to say on this at a later stage. The landlord and tenant relationship is a contractual one. Both parties place their signature on a document and know that throughout the period of that lease, which is basically only an annual tenancy—the fact that it is a protected annual tenancy is another matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make clear that the point I was making was that the only motive anyone has advanced for this legislation is hardship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I was trying to say that even that is a poor one. I take that point. We have had debate about this in the House and in Standing Committee. No doubt we shall continue it further. I do not accept the hardship argument in the way my hon. Friend does, but the Government have made this a plank whenever they have been trying to justify this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I discussed with a lawyer last week the actual real value of the concession contained in this new clause. What is the real value? What is the value of enjoying a property? Perhaps I should not ask you, Mr. Costain, to answer this question, but you will know in your professional expertise that a lawyer will look upon a 99-year lease as being not quite a freehold but having a substantial value. When the lease runs to 150 years, in terms of enjoyment the value is equivalent to that of the freehold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>860</span>
We are proposing in effect a tenancy, as has been suggested, of 100 years; it could be more, it could be less. It is my belief that we are giving to the tenant by this legislation—and " give " is the right word—the enjoyment of his farm, albeit at an economic rent, and the enjoyment of his land, for what is amounting to a full freehold period. I can see no reason why paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Parliamentary Secretary will argue paragraph (	<i>b</i>) with more passion because, I suppose, there can be circumstances where a brother or a sister enjoy a similar position to that of a son. I beseech him to be cautious before he widens the provision of his original thought and the provisions asked for by the NFU. It is my definite impression when I speak to people in the NFU about this matter that they certainly did not ever envisage such a wide application of their ideas as is contained in new Clause 8. I believe that the hon. Gentleman will find that the NFU is opposed to his provisions. I hope he will say what has come out in discussions on this. It is my clear impression that they never asked for so many people to be included. It was merely a question of son, daughter or widow in certain special cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The NFU statement, issued to all members, said:
	<br><q><p>"The NFU is also glad to note that the Government has contained the category of those eligible to apply for a tenancy within the limitations of the legislation applicable to Scotland but with the addition of ' brother or sister ' of the deceased tenant."</p></q>
Far from deploring it, it welcomes it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did say that the hon. Gentleman would no doubt argue the brother and sister point with considerable passion. He has said that the NFU continued its blindness by wishing the legislation to extend beyond the original proposals and give its blessing to the Socialist legislation proposed. I think there is no mention made of paragraph (	<i>d</i>). I have not that paper in front of me. I will look at it later, but I do not think there is any mention of widening the clause to this extent. It is essential in the interests of equity and fairness that this matter be narrowed back to the original ideas and extended not one inch further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to inter-

vene but I could not let these remarks of the hon. Gentleman pass. He suggested that it is his impression that the NFU has a particular point of view. I was reading from its statement that shows it had a precisely opposite view. I do not want him to give a totally false impression to this Committee. This thing, Oscar Wilde once said, is the better left to the dentist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement said:
	<br><q><p>"This will allow for the sort of situation that can arise in practice where, say, two brothers are farming in partnership but the tenancy is in the name of the one who died first."</p></q>
In fact the NFU recognises this important category. It should be included and the NFU welcomes its inclusion. All of us with experience of this know that very often the case that does cause hardship is the case of brothers who were in farming together. Therefore I think there is no case whatever in trying to delete paragraph (	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a technical problem, but a real one, when there is a son of the deceased tenant too young to inherit. I do not understand the intricacies of the English law. No doubt, a comment will be made on that. It seems perfectly possible for the son of the tenant who has died to be safeguarded in some such form as a trust or whatever. Therefore, in equity it is proner that this paragraph should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two things are forgotten. One is that there is at the end of the day a judgment to be made by the Agricultural Land Tribunal in which a number of these cases will be taken into consideration. This could be dealt with by only extending it to two generations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was commenting on the use of the word " only". I thought I had made the point that, far from being " only ", the concession in this new clause allows virtual freehold use of the property taking it away from one person and giving it gratuitously to another. I suppose that is Part of the hon. Gentleman's political philosophy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a safeguard from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>862</span>
that point of view, but the other point will be subject to decision of the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second curious thing is that when dealing with property in relation to taxation, hon. Gentlemen opposite say that taxation is so crippling that no one wants the property, that the property is a dead weight around the neck and that people are being taxed out of the market. However, as soon as the suggestion is made that it should pass to someone else, then it is a valuable property: it is priceless: we can hardly set a value upon it. They ought to make up their minds which it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point is in relation to paragraph (	<i>d</i>) and the astonishing carry on in the countryside of Mrs. Bloggins marrying the tenant of 80 in order that her son should inherit. I do not know if this is the case particularly in the landed, lurid circles of the Tory Party, but it is not encountered in real life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to wonder what real life the hon. Member ever sees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are dealing with is the perfectly straightforward situation in which a child is brought into the family and hought up as the child in that family. It has been on the holding and has satisfied all the criteria and in equity should be treated as a child of the deceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think hon. Members opposite have made out their case for the exclusions, and I hope the Minister will reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going to restrict my comments basically to the views expressed by a group of people who have no political allegiance and are solely interested in the health of the agricultural industry in this country. I refer to the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs. That is an extremely active group of people who have done, continue to do, and will always do a great deal of good for our agricultural industry. They say quite categorically that they accept the inclusion of directly adopted fostered children as being eligible to succeed to the tenancy. They also believe that stepchildren should be eligible to succeed, provided, of course, they fulfil all the other requirements, but they do not believe, and they have said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>863</span>
this very firmly, that any other possibilities should be considered. Therefore I am supporting my hon. Friends when they say that paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) should be left out of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dockers have protection for their jobs but I do not believe even they allow for a dramatic increase in the scope of the people who may succeed to their jobs and become members of the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to know from the Minister why the Government have drawn the clause as wide as they have. I do not think it will help agriculture. The Parliamentary Secretary will have to make out a very good case, which has so far not been made out, that the scope for eligibility should be drawn so wide. Perhaps the Minister, representing, as he does, a Scottish constituency, can indicate that the Scottish legislation will be as wide in its scope as this new legislation. I really think it is unnecessary to draw it quite so wide. If the few hardship cases which have been drawn to the attention of the Committee are anything to go by it will relate virtually entirely to the son of the deceased tenant. I am not saying it will exclusively, 100 per cent., but if we are to see justice done to all sections of agriculture the scope of eligibility in this clause is too wide and will not act in the interests of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give full attention to this and make certain concessions so that the reasonable amendments we have put down can be incorporated in this legislation. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that we are trying to improve the legislation, not to obstruct it or scrap it. I fully support the views expressed from this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried throughout to look at the matter from the point of view of good husbandry. I do not believe we shall help good husbandry by the widening of the categories of people who can inherit tenancies. I personally think it is a retrograde step. I know of cases of hardship, including spouses, particularly in my part of the world. Women are capable, but there are many women much more capable of doing other things than running a big arable farm. I personally do not believe that the sister should be brought into this. All the farmers I have spoken to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
feel that it should only go as far as the son. I met my own branch of the NFU in my home town a few weeks ago, and those farmers thought that they ought to go along with the question of a son being considered, but felt we should not widen it to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe, if there are two brothers of about the same age, that, unless the landlord has adopted them as joint tenants, the one brother should have a perfect right to continue the farm after the other has died. I cannot really see why a brother, merely because he has lived on the farm, should inherit that tenancy. I cannot believe that a brother or sister of the deceased will be the right person to get the most out of the land which he or she is farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will try to explain a little more fully to me what these words really are going to mean. I hope he has considered this matter with really good legal advice. If we widen this scope very considerably I believe we are laying upon the shoulders of the Agricultural Land Tribunal a far greater burden than it is accustomed to. The number of people who will come in front of the tribunal to claim the right to inherit will be very large, and there will be a difficult job to do. I support my hon. Friends, to cut back the number of people the Agricultural Land Tribunal will have to consider. I do not believe that for good husbandry. and production from the land, there should be inheritance of tenancies in those cases I have mentioned. We are placing an enormous burden of judgment on the Agricultural Land Tribunal. I hope the Minister will try to explain the lengths to which paragraph (	<i>d</i>) will take us and how far this can go. As my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has said, it seems to draw the matter very wide indeed. It seems to me that this will make the job of the Agricultural Land Tribunal almost an impossibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly reply to a number of very specific questions asked by hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) that when we talk of the wife we are indeed talking about the wife of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
the deceased tenant at the time of his death and no other wife. A divorced woman would not be eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member referred to the possibility of some dissention, or a son being disadvantaged when a brother succeeded to the tenancy where the son of the deceased tenant was already working on the holding. Hon. Members must bear in mind that we specify in these provisions that where the deceased tenant has bequeathed the holding to a near relative then the Agricultural Land Tribunal will be required to give that relative first priority. We would advise very strongly all tenant farmers who wish to see their holdings pass to a near relative to make a will specifying which of the potentially eligible persons they would like to succeed. Of course, in the case where there is no will the Agricultural Land Tribunal will decide which of those eligible persons is the suitable person. I can inform the hon. Gentleman the Member for Westmorland that an adopted child is indeed a child as defined under paragrap (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) has spent some time during our proceedings complaining that we are slavishly following the Scottish legislation. He used the phrase " Out-Celt the Celts". He sees this as part of some great takeover by the Celts to impose laws on the poor Saxons. I do not think he can have it both ways. I do not think he can complain when we religiously follow the Scottish legislation but also complain when we depart from it.

The hon. Gentleman the Member for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) raised the question of the NFU. As far as the position of the brother and sister is concerned, the National Farmers' Union specifically requested that they be included. Hon. Members will understand why. We can envisage a situation where two brothers have farmed the holding, where, perhaps, there are no sons of either. I can think of a case near where I was brought up myself. In all fairness it would be right to enable the brother to carry on after his brother had died. There are obviously grounds for real hardship in that situation. It was right and proper for the Government to respond to this request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>866</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, and a brother can succeed to the tenancy, can a landowner at the end of that tenancy, when the brother dies, take that farm in hand without all the paraphernalia of the legislation we are considering? Or can that tenant then have two successions within his family?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members must study the new clauses. If there is still a succession to take place and the brother of the deceased tenant becomes the tenant farmer, then his son, assuming he fulfils the qualifications, will have the right to apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), raised questions which are fundamental to this whole matter. I do not wish repeatedly to respond to these points. I believe these provisions will lead to better agricultural husbandry, and to a higher level of investment by tenant farmers who put the bulk of their investment into the holding. Furthermore, by introducing these clauses, I believe we shall be reducing a not insignificant number of cases of real hardship which arise in relation to these matters. I do not wish to go over that ground again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Macclesfield, I respect the views of the Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs. I have read in detail what the Young Farmers have said. They are opposed in principle to the whole idea of giving a younger relative a right to apply to the Land Agricultural Tribunal. I can understand their views, as I do those of the National Farmers' Union and the Country Landowners' Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member from Norfolk, South-West, I hope he will stop using the phrase "inheriting a tenancy". We are not giving someone the right to inherit a tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come now finally to the treated child. This particular category of designated close relative follows a similar provision in the Inheritant Provision for Family and Dependants Act 1975.

	<br><q><p>"was treated by the deceased as a child of the family in relation to that marriage."</p></q>
I should assure the hon. Member for Westmorland that an adult taken in to live with the family will not qualify. He will have had to have been taken in and to have lived as a child of the family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to save a few words when saying "inheriting the tenancy". I am sure the Minister knows exactly what I meant. He has now quoted as the reason for paragraph (	<i>d</i>), as far as I understand, some Inheritance Act. It seems to me the Minister is relying on this inheritance legislation to bring paragraph
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>868</span>
(	<i>d</i>) into being, and I have not yet had it explained fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of the day it is obviously a matter of judgment whether we feel it is right and proper that we should, through this legislation, ensure that not only the bona fide child of a marriage on the holding, but also a child who has been treated as a member of the family, should be similarly classified for the purpose of this legislation. I have indicated the precedent for this. The reason for the precedent would be obvious to hon. Members and to others in these humane and compassionate days. As far as reasonable, one should not discriminate between a child brought up in a family who does not happen to be a blood relation of the parties and does not happen to have been adopted and a child who is a proper child of one or other of the parties to the marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all a matter of balance, but we have decided, on balance. I am fairly certain the National Farmers' Union did not specifically ask for this category, but I would have thought there would be strong support for it throughout the industry. At the end of the day it is a matter of judgment. The Government's judgment is that it is right and proper in this legislation, as has been the case in other legislation, to allow a child in this category to be treated as though it were a normal child of the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, with these remarks, hon. Members might be prepared to reconsider their attitude to these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have to do better than this if he wants us to accept his explanations.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the first case first, he told us of the brother, and he accepted there might be hardships existing. I wish to explain in a fuller way what I meant to say before. I can envisage a situation where a tenant dies, who has a brother working on the farm; that the tenant might also have a son, say, aged 21 or 22, who has not worked on the farm the full five years suggested by this new clause. On the tenant's death the son does not qualify under the new clause because he has not worked long enough on the farm, but may be the landlord feels he is prepared
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
to take the risk of having one so young and inexperienced and he wants the son to have the farm. Yet the brother can come along and say "No; the son does not qualify under new Clause 8. I am going to put my son into the position of ultimately being able to inherit the tenancy". I am sorry to use this phrase, but it is a useful shorthand way, and it is factual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The brother is put into an impossibly advantageous position compared with the children of the tenant. This must be so. Where we have the situation of a landlord who wants to let the farm to the son or his ex-tenant, he is not able to do so because we are including the brother here. A brother can set up his own dynasty for his own children by claiming it against the wishes of the landlord and of his deceased brother's son. This seems totally unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel it would not be a severe hardship to exclude brothers from this clause. In most cases, when a tenant dies, if he has a brother working on the farm, actuarially it will be true that that brother will be near the normal age of death or retirement in any case. There will be comparatively far less hardship to a tenant's brother after the death of the tenant, than there will be to a tenant's son. This must be so. There can be no argument about this in actuarial terms. I plead with the Minister to reconsider his attitude to the brother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the second part of the discussion—to the treated child. Following the remarks which were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) last week I have obtained the text of the letter in 	<i>The Times</i> newspaper of last Tuesday morning from Mr. Wilfred Cave of Marlborough, who is, as I understand it, a leading member of the Labour Party. It is a letter on the very matter we are discussing:
	<br><q><p>"Thus an elderly tenant farmer without children could ask for and no doubt obtain a considerable sum for adopting a well-qualified would-he farmer".</p></q>
This is what I believe is likely to happen. I can see that a family having enough money to set up a son as a tenant farmer would think, when that young man leaves school, of looking for an elderly tenant farmer and asking if he would be prepared to adopt the young man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only "adopt", because the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>870</span>
Parliamentary Secretary let slip this morning a phrase which set the alarm bells ringing in my mind. Whilst Mr. Cave talks about adopting a young man, the Parliamentary Secretary said "treated as a member of the family". That would mean where a young man goes to live with a farming family, lives in with them, spends all his time with them, works on the farm, lives permanently in the house and goes around with them, by the definition the Parliamentary Secretary has given us this morning, that young man, almost anyone who gets into this position, does not have to go through the rigmarole of adoption. The Parliamentary Secretary has taken this proposal even further than I realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage in the future arguments about this matter going on in the Agricultural Land Tribunal. I can see a tenant's family or a young man claiming he was treated as the member of a family and saying: "The Parliamentary Secretary in his speech in the Committee said hat if you were treated as a member of the family you were entitled to be called a person who qualified under subsection 1(	<i>d</i>) of this section of this Act."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has not told us what the position is. I spoke earlier about the land girl. The position I cited was that of a girl who, when aged 16 or 17, joined the Women's Land Army and went to live on a farm during the war. She was a child by the definition that the Parliamentary Secretary gave us. I am perfectly sure a girl in that situation would then be allowed to claim the tenancy and be considered as an eligible person under the provisions of this clause and in accordance with the remarks made by the Parliamentary Secretary this morning. I am perfectly sure we have here a tremendous opportunity for abuse, and I plead again with the Government to think again on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary has not convinced me at all and unless he can do a good deal better in explaining this matter I feel we shall be forced into the position of trying to get our amendments put into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister possibly reply on the point about the tenant with a son and a brother and the case put by my hon. Friend the Member for West-

Morland (Mr. Jopling) of a landlord wanting the son to inherit? It is the kind of case that I myself have come across as a land agent. I cannot believe the Minister really means that to apply if a tenant has a son of the age of 20 or 22 who is living on the holding but cannot possibly have worked on it in terms of subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>),
	<br><q><p>'throughout a continuous period of not less than five years",</p></q>
As far as I can see that son could be completely cut out from even applying to the Land Tribunal at all and the brother could more than place him just in front. Even if the tenant writes into his will a clause saying he wishes his son to inherit, I understand that through the operation of the clause the son would not be able to qualify at the age of 20. I may be totally wrong, but that seems to me to be a case where a landlord might well feel that a young man, perhaps undergoing a year or two at an agricultural college, might be a better man to inherit than the brother.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify that point, obviously we have to write in certain qualifications which have to be fulfilled before anyone can apply to the ALT; and if the son does not fulfil these qualifications it is inherent in any scheme of things that he will not be able to acquire a direction from the ALT that he should succeed to the tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Anyone who knows the agricultural world can imagine what will happen where there is a series of people able to apply. One can imagine many cases where people will feel they would have had a right to inherit if the father had lived a year or two longer. I do not believe the National Farmers' Union realises the situation, or that the Minister would wish this kind of hardship to be perpetuated in yet another form of hardship. In this case bad blood will be caused in the agricultural industry— not between landlord and tenant, but between those working in the agricultural industry as tenants or prospective tenants. Feuds and hardships will be created between farmers. There can be no doubt whatever about that. I feel very strongly on this point and the Minister should accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the new clause, in line 8, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(	<i>e</i>) any farmworker employed by the deceased on that holding, where no applications are made under section (Applications for tenancy of the holding) of this Act, by any of the persons within paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>d</i>) above."</p></q>
Since discussions started on these amendments, following the discussion on the Floor of the House, I have been looking at the very valuable points made by the Opposition, particularly those made on the hereditary principle, which it is felt, in this day and age, can be carried too far. I took this view on board in framing this amendment, so as to achieve maximum unity on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second point made by hon. Members on the Front Bench opposite, to which I paid a great deal of attention, was the possibility, as they saw it, that these provisions might dry up the flow of new entrants into farming. I considered those points carefully and felt that the Opposition were right in saying that there could sometimes be exclusivity on heredity as well as on other aspects. I do not think there is great danger of any drying up of new entrants, but, clearly, we wish to achieve maximum unity and support for the general principle, since that general principle has never been rejected by the Conservative party, and it seemed to us on this side that it might be more appropriate, and more effective, for this gesture to be made by a Back Bencher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against that background that I move this amendment. We have been dealing with the question of possible injustice over succession, and the Opposition agree that there should be succession by a son in all cases, except those of a spouse, brother or sister, or by a person treated as a child. Therefore, the principle is clearly established. Bringing these poipts together, bearing in mind the attitude of both sides towards the hereditary principle, and having in mind the importance of bringing new entrants in, as emphasised by hon. Gentlemen opposite, it seems to me that the best way of bringing this about is by including provision for the farm worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farm worker is clearly identified with the holding. His livelihood has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>874</span>
depended upon it, as often has that of a son, brother or other relative. Therefore, the case in principle for the farmworker should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second aspect related not only to involvement of the holding but to the question of new entrants. Clearly, we do not want the kind of institutional buying of farms that has been taking place. Rather we want to open farming up to people with experience and skill; and this has been emphasised during the debate, to their credit, largely by hon. Members opposite who have spoken of the danger of people coming into farming through inheritance without the necessary skills and experience. This ties up with that right, because the farm worker has the skill and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not pushing this proposal too far. We realise that there must be a balance between heredity and new entrants, but we say that, where there is no succession under the family category, the farm worker should be considered by the ALT, again making a balance between the farmer and the son of a farm worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take an extremely broad view on the definition of " farm worker " as covering a man who works on a farm. The question has been asked, particularly by hon. Gentlemen opposite, " What about the situation of the farm manager? " They emphasised this particularly strongly in the context of new entrants, saying these were people with experience of managing and of farming. We are not seeking to block them from opportunities of holding a farm, and the definition which is here included will, I hope, cover them completely. I see no reason why it should not. Perhaps the Minister will make that point clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While a farm manager may well be a farm worker, a farm worker more often than not will not be a farm manager.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is pretty clever, and I accept it. That was why I made a broad definition, so that they can be joined. It is absolutely inclusive of them both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two points. First, many people who go into farming have exactly the same kind of experience as a farm worker. They have, perhaps, worked on a holding and gained their skill and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>875</span>
experience, without any formal diplomas or agricultural education. Therefore, they are on all fours with them. There is also no reason to suppose that a farm worker who is not the son of a farmer will not have the ability of the son of a farmer. We all know that the farm worker probably has a wider range of skills than any other worker in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is no reason why, given this new amendment, we cannot extend the skills and experience of farm workers by giving a fresh urgency to the question of training—not just in the technical skills, but also in aspects of management—which could open up opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with this final point that, if hon. Members are concerned lest someone does not have sufficient skill, experience and knowledge, it will be a matter of judgment by the Tribunal. We seek no more than that they should be considered in that way, along with other people whose devotion, life and work have been given to a certain holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I waited before rising to reply because I thought that hon. Members opposite might have been drawn to make a few comments on this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have them all—on the last amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that my hon. Friend is correct in believing that hon. Members opposite are supporting this amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We on this side feel that it would be better to hear what the Minister has to say, and we want to listen to his reaction to this proposal. If the Minister is not quite ready to make his speech and has not thought up his line, perhaps we can adjourn the Committee for a few moments so that he can gather his thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am very happy to respond to my hon. Friend's amendment, but hon. Members opposite have repeatedly said how they want the Government to take into account their views on all these matters, and it is normal for us to expect them to give their views before the Government reply. I am happy to accept this different approach from the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say to my hon. Friend that he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>876</span>
has made a very compelling case for the farm worker? It is indeed the case that what we are saying with regard to these provisions is, first, that if someone is to have a right to apply it must be a near relative, someone having a close relationship with the tenant. Secondly, he or she must have a close relationship with that holding, must have worked on it, who has a better relationship with it than the farm worker, who will have had to work there for five years? In many instances, the farm worker will have worked there for decades; indeed, farm workers have sometimes worked on a holding for longer than the tenant farmer has farmed it. So who can have a closer attachment to and a more intimate knowledge of the holding than farm workers in that position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has argued cogently that one of the attractions of his proposal is that it would bring new blood into tenanted farms. It would ensure that when the tenant farmer died, and he did not have a near relative who had the qualifications and wished to succeed to the holding, workers who were qualified would be able, subject to the authority of the Agricultural Land Tribunal, to succeed to the tenancy of the holding. I do not think any hon. Members would dispute that that is a very exciting proposition, and it is certainly one which would meet a number of criticisms which hon. Members have made with regard to the effect of the provisions on new tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some counter-arguments to be put. I suppose some would argue that the farm worker who was chosen under this procedure might well not be the most deserving to take over a holding. Some would argue that it would be better that farm workers not just associated with the holding, but who had, perhaps, acquired not only expertise in relation to work on the farm but managerial expertise, should be in a position to apply. That is a fairly weak criticism, because we have always accepted as implicit in our approach that the son or near relative should be associated with the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have indicated that I feel my hon. Friend has put forward a proposition which must attract great interest and support throughout the industry, but it incorporates a completely new principle into what we have in mind here. The principle which has been argued through-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>877</span>
out, and, indeed, it is the whole basis of these provisions, is the element of hardship which could arise were a near relative of the deceased's family unable to succeed to the holding. When my right hon. Friend opened the debate in the House on 8th March, he said:
	<br><q><p>"… in principle some limited legal provision for family succession is desirable".</p></q>
Later he said:
	<br><q><p>"… it seems to me that in social or human terms a claim to succeed to a tenancy, if the main purpose is to avoid possible hardship, is likely to have real strength only in the case of a near relative".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March 1976, Vol. 907; 	<i>c.</i> 47.]</p></q>
I think my hon. Friend would concede that, and would acknowledge that real hardship—and, to be fair, very few hon. Members, if any, have denied that instances of real hardship arise at the present time—is likely to arise in relation to the farm worker. It is also fair to acknowledge that, very often, we are dealing with a situation where the capital is regarded as a family asset. It is not uncommon nowadays for people to regard money which their father, wife or son has, when working together, as communal capital. So there is an argument for saying that the investment in a farm, when there is a son working on it with his father, is not to some extent just the capital of the father, but is also the capital of the son.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So what I have to say to my hon. Friend is that, though I am deeply attracted by his propsal, the Government have decided, on balance, that it incorporates a completely new principle, and that the purpose of these new clauses is to avoid the hardship which could arise in the situation of a near relative. Therefore, we have decided that on this occasion it would not be correct, in relation to these new clauses, to incorporate this new principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member had better make up his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a problem of making up my mind. The problem is whether there is anyone else in this Committee who opposes this amendment. May be hon. Members have things to say which it would be valuable to hear—[Hon. Members: "We are trying to make progress."]—If no one else wishes to speak, then I shall do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed the opening two-thirds of the Minister's speech. He argued the case rather better than I did for the amendment, so I was surprised to hear the change of tone towards the end of his speech. I thought he made an impeccable case for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I recognise that what impels the introduction of these clauses is the question of hardship arising for the family of a tenant farmer. What we are saying is that, having introduced these clauses, we recognise that other hardships will arise. There will be a new relationship, which the other side of the Committee has stressed, and it is important to ensure that a satisfactory tenant takes over a farm. A farm is more than land and property: it is also the people who work on it, and they will be placed in a new situation, and an element of hardship can arise for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in all the circumstances, particularly in view of the tacit approval that we have received from all Members of the Committee, other than the Minister in his last few words—and I think that, if he intends to vote against it, it will be a pity to be in such a small minority—I feel that I have to press it to such a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understood that it was a principle of the operations of the House and of its Committees—indeed, I remember it being applied in one case in this Committee—that the vote follows the voice. I remember my hon. Friend the Government Whip being isolated because he shouted " No " to a Government amendment, and found himself in a minority of one. It seems to me that it is a valuable principle that the vote should follow the voice, but I accept that there is a difficulty when there is no voice, and that is what has happened on this occasion.

	<br><q><p>"and for requiring Tribunals to be convened and to funclion according to rules covering procedure including the content and form of applications, rights of appearance and representation, rules of procedure, together with details of the Tribunal's rights to award costs.".</p></q></p>
	<p>Amendment (	<i>h</i>), in line 19, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>"and for specifying procedures to give adequate time to the landlord to take the opportunities required to be afforded him by sections (Applications for tenancy of the holding) (7) apd (Opportunity for landlord to obtain Tribunal's consent to operation of notice to quit) (1)".</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the new clause, in line 19, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>"and for requiring that where there is more than one such application in any case, all applications shall be heard together at one hearing".</p></q>
When we originally put the amendments down we put down amendment (	<i>ee</i>) as an all embracing one on the subsection. We do not propose to move that one, and that is not what I wish to talk to. If we pass amendment (	<i>ee</i>) we cannot talk about amendments (	<i>dd</i>) and (	<i>h</i>). We are getting into complications with all these
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>880</span>
designations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause allows applications from a wide class of relatives, and, as we have already heard today, of non-relatives as well. It will be possible to have a number of applications, perhaps many, and the landlords should not be required to tackle a succession of cases before the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (	<i>dd</i>) would require applications to be taken together. If not, a landlord might defeat a bad application only to find that he has to start again with further proceedings. This is a valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to amendment (	<i>h</i>), we are again on this question of the procedures before the tribunal. The detailed procedures for applications under this new clause are not provided for, but subsection (2) provides for an order be made requiring applicants to give notice of applications to the landlord or other interested persons. It will also be important for the landlord to be able to appear at the hearing of applications, to make his case. Therefore he must have adequate time to prepare his case and must have suitable notice of the hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under new Clause (10)(7) it is required that a tribunal should:
	<br><q><p>"afford the landlord an opportunity of stating his views on the suitability of that applicant".</p></q>
New Clause 11(1) requires the tribunal to:
	<br><q><p>"afford the landlord an opportunity of applying for their consent under this section to the operation of the notice".</p></q>
Amendment (	<i>h</i>) would require an order giving the landlord adequate time to take these opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are relatively technical and, I would hope, fairly u ncontroversial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope from what the Minister said on a previous occasion, I think the last time we met, that we may he pushing at an open door here. These are intensely practical points that we are raising. The aim of Amendment (	<i>dd</i>), that all applications should be heard at one sitting, is obviously sensible. From the Agricultural Land Tribunal's point of view, they want to be able to compare all applications together. It is rather like opening tenders. It is a question of good husbandry. If we spread out the hearings the farmer will suffer in the intervening period, and the costs to the tenants, the Land Tribunals, the country and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>881</span>
landlord must mount. I hope that the Minister, even if these precise words do not find approval, will be able to say that he agrees in principle to this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendment (	<i>h</i>), I think the Minister acknowledged to me at a previous sitting that he was himself aware that it is very necessary that a series of procedures and time limits and so on be laid down. The points which I would make and the Chartered Surveyors' Institution, of which I am a member, has already drawn to his officials' attention, are as follows. It is essential that time limits be laid down. Otherwise both landlord and tenant, and, for that matter, the country, can suffer because of the delays in getting a new tenant. Since obviously, many tenants could be involved in these hearings and they could involve tenants competing against one another it is my own opinion, and that of the Chartered Surveyors' Institution, that assessors should be appointed in every case, where there is more than one at any rate, and that they should, as a mandatory provision of the regulations, sit with the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to know what the Minister can tell me about the question of costs. Has the Agricultural Land Tribunal the right to award costs? I believe there ought to be a right in the tribunal to award costs one way or another, and in most hearings of this sort it is possible to do so. It is not made absolutely clear in the new clauses as they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations should be made without delay once the Bill is enacted. There must be a number of cases which will come up as soon as the Bill is enacted, and the details should be determined clearly, and the content and form of application. The Minister has under the Agricultural Holdings Act a number of useful forms which are used by applicants over many matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a large number of extra burdens on the ALT as a result of this new clause and new Clauses 11 and 12. From what we have heard earlier today on previous amendments they will be the most extraordinarily onerous burdens. The decision of deciding between one person and another as to who should have a livelihood, who should have a tenancy of a holding, will need a great deal of expertise, human knowledge and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>882</span>
examination. I am not at all sure that in all cases Agricultural Land Tribunals up and down the country are fully fitted for it, which is why I have asked before about the position of assessors, whether the list of assessors is up to date, and whether they have been used recently, because I believe that in the future they are going to be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to know what the record of the ALT—with the small burden placed upon it at the present time—has been in taking hearings. It is very important that we do not have unnecessary delays. We cannot have the delays there are in the courts of this land at present. Cases are delayed month after month. Land has to be farmed and farmed well. The sooner we can arrive at a new tenant the better for all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is very important that each party has the right to challenge the evidence of the other party. This is not clear in the new clauses. I believe it comes under new Clause 10(7) which we shall be looking at later. According to my advice at present, it is not clear whether each party will be able to challenge the others. I hope the Minister will be able to tell us today more of what he intends will be in these regulations, and that they will cover the points raised and that they will be brought into operation, after consultation, during the next few months, the moment this Bill has finally received the Royal Assent. Any delays over bringing cases to the ALT, any delays which the ALT have themselves in hearing cases, will be bad for farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any legal practitioner will be a little worried about Amendment (	<i>dd</i>) which imposes a procedural fetter. It requires tribunals to hear all applications at once. The word " shall " has been inserted, not "may". This could cause some difficulties. In the first place, if there is a number of applications the hearing will be prolonged, and all parties will have to be there or feel obliged to be there. Not only will that cause some personal inconvenience, which could be, perhaps, immaterial in cases like this, but the cost will be that much greater. It might prove onerous to those parties who have only a very small part to play in the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is important is that the chairman of the tribunal must be assumed to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>883</span>
have some common sense and will dispose of the matter with expertise and to the convenience of everyone. Before the applications are heard inquiries will be made of those taking part, particularly of their legal representatives. If it is convenient to all concerned that those applications should be heard at once and together they will be. That is how all courts behave. I do not think anyone could say that courts do not take into account, as far as they can, the convenience of all parties concerned, not least, the issue of cost.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would mean a fetter. It would have to be applied regardless of the circumstances.

This ought to be left to the chairman of the tribunal, for him in the ordinary way to carry out soundings of those concerned and reach a conclusion.

The most important point he raised relates to Amendment (	<i>h</i>) where he is asking, quite reasonably, that the landlord should have sufficient time to prepare his case in order to oppose an application to the ALT to succeed to the tenancy. The answer to that was touched on by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). As hon. Members know, the procedures with regard to this matter are laid down by statutory instrument, and we have envisaged that once we have enacted this change in the law it will be necessary to modify the statutory instrument. We shall do so in full consultation with the Country Landowners Association, the NFU and other interested parties. We will take account of the reasonable point the hon. Member has raised, that it is only sensible to ensure that the landlord has time to prepare his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to cost, the normal procedure here is that the Exchequer meets the cost of the tribunal's hearings, but, of course, the parties are responsible for their own costs. In exceptional circumstances the tribunal can award costs against the person concerned in the reference of the application when it appears to the tribunal that he acted frivolously, vexatiously or oppressively when applying to the ALT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very interesting point which the Parliamentary Secretary has just raised. Who is a vexatious litigant in these circumstances? Should it not be widely known that if somebody who does apply has no reason to do so could find himself faced with costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are really referring to the extreme position. Obviously there will be cases where someone feels he is an eligible person but it is a borderline case, perhaps in relation to how long he has worked on the holding, or in relation to his agricultural qualifications. I am sure the hon. Gentleman would be the last to suggest that someone who applied in good faith to the ALT should automatically be regarded as required to pay the costs himself or herself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are precedents, but my concern is to be clear that this is not to be a two-way traffic and that any costs that may be awarded may be made available to either party to the action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That is a fair and helpful point. Obviously this has to be a two-way traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had just touched on the point the hon. Member raised in Amendment (	<i>dd</i>) where he seeks to write into the legislation that all applications shall be heard at the one hearing. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) described this as a procedural fetter on the ALT. We would obviously envisage that in all normal situations the tribunal would indeed hear all the evidence and would consider all the applications at one hearing. This is a sensible procedure to adopt, and we shall assume that the chairmen of the tribunals—and they are very responsible men—would invariably adopt that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it would be a mistake to write this into legislation. If, for unusual reasons, the tribunal were unable to complete its consideration of applications in one hearing, we would have a situation where it would have contravened the law as suggested by this amendment. This is a point which we can consider in relation to the procedures which we will be laying down. The procedural framework within which the ALT will have to operate with regard to this system is, of course, laid down in new Clauses 8 and 10 and we will have an opportunity to discuss these when we come to them. However, this will be supplemented by amendments to the statutory instrument to take account of the new situation created by these new clauses.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister he saying something, when we come to other new clauses, about the question of challenging evidence?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the assurances he has given that aspects of these matters can be reconsidered at a later stage.

	<p>	<i>Amendment to the new clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment—(	<i>w</i>) —to the new clause, in line 25, after "below)" insert "(i)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Amendment (	<i>x</i>), in line 34, at end, insert:
	<br><q><p>"(ii) a child of the landlord who fulfils the copditions of (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) above, except that lhe qualifying periods of work under (	<i>b</i>) may have been carried out on any agricultural holding".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment I am moving is of a very minor nature, introductory to what is of a great deal more importance. Amendment (	<i>x</i>), which tries to give opportunity for the child of a landlord to share in some of the very large benefits which, in terms of cash and the enjoyment of the use of a holding, are proposed to be extended under these arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been talking a great deal, throughout these debates, about hardship. On this side we have recognised that certain cases do exist where hardship is caused particularly to the sons of deceased persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can quite often find a landlord who has bought a farm with a sitting tenant on it in the expectation that, after that tenant's death, the farm will become available for the use of his son. It will be recalled that when we debated this matter a week last Monday I actually read out a letter which I had received and which I have since sent to the Minister and which deals with a very similar case. I have had another letter from another hon. Member of the House: it is not advisable to reveal names, although I am perfectly prepared to reveal names privately to the Minister.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>887</span>
I have further evidence of another case where a man, for the use of his son, bought a farm with a sitting tenant, and bought with the intention of his son's farming the holding after the tenant's retirement or death. I am sure there is a very great risk that with the passing of this legislation we could create a situation where sons of landlords could suffer very considerable hardship indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to see that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) has seen fit to put his name to Amendment (	<i>x</i>). Many of us thought he made a very thoughtful and reasonable speech when we debated these matters on the Floor of the House. It has given me very real pleasure that this amendment, which I drafted myself, has met with his approval. I hope this will give added weight to the case we are putting with regard to it, and I am hoping very much indeed that this is one of those things which the Government will be able to agree to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that if one is going to try to give some priority to the child of a landlord then he or she should, of course, have to comply with a good many of the rules in the same way that the son or near relation of a tenant should have to. We believe that the son of the landlord should have worked for seven years, prior to the death of the tenant, in farming, and that five years out of the seven should have been on the farm. We believe he should not be the occupier of another holding because it would be hard to claim there would be quite so much hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know of very many cases where the landlord's son actually works on the farm which is let to a tenant. Therefore I think one has to make a difference for the child of a landlord, and that is why we have put in this amendment the proviso that the qualifying period of five years' work out of seven years' could have been on any other agricultural holding. It would be totally unreasonable to say that the work should have taken place on the holding in question. However, in relation to the son or near relation of a tenant it is quite right and proper that the Government should have insisted, as they have. that the qualifying work should have been done on the holding in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe this is a step in the direction that we on this side have been calling
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>888</span>
for all along. We have said one or two of these provisions go too far and we want some levelling of them. The first new clause, which has been withdrawn, has been the father and mother of all the Government's seven new clauses. With the backing of the hon. Member for Durham and with the reasonable attitude that he demonstrated over these matters when we had the debate on the Floor of the House, with this unity across party lines, the Government, I hope, will he able to tell us they can accept this amendment. It may be that the drafting is imperfect: I drafted it myself, and if the Minister tells me that its drafting is imperfect I will accept the criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a modest amendment which could be of great assistance in certain cases to the small landlord. I do not think this amendment will be of much help to the large landlord. It is the small landlord who will be most seriously hurt by the provisions of these new clauses. It is particularly in that direction that the amendment will give some leavening and some assistance. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us he can accept the principle, even if he is not prepared to accept the words of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple question for the Parliamentary Secretary. It is purely for my information although it has a hearing on the general theme advanced by my hon. Friend. Would it be within the power of a tenant in any way to renounce either generally or specifically the rights that will be conferred upon him by the passing of this Bill with these new clauses? The implications of that are that one might arrive at precisely the situation which he advocated by means of amendment. But the question does also have other implications. I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary could give us guidance and interpretation on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is " No". If T understand the hon. Member correctly, what he is asking is whether the son of a tenant or the tenant himself can, in advance, renounce the statutory right which the tenant's near relative will have to apply for the tenancy if he is an eligible person. Any arrangement of that nature would have to be a voluntary one.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>889</span>
A voluntary gentleman's agreement between a tenant and a landlord would not cut across the legal provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has raised an interesting point. He is seeking to ensure that the landlord's son, although he has now worked on the holding—and that is one of the clear requirements which we have written in here—will be able, provided he has worked on some other holding, to apply for the tenancy, and that his application will be considered by the Agricultural Land Tribunal alongside any other applications from near relatives of the tenant farmer. If the hon. Gentleman's purpose in this is quite simply to ensure that greater hardship should not befall the landlord and his family than the deceased tenant's family, then we can go some way to help him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be in this way. On a previous occasion hon. Members have raised the question of what will constitute greater hardship. What criteria will the Agricultural Land Tribunal have to bear in mind when deciding whether or not there will be greater hardships on the landlord than on the near relative, if the Agricultural Land Tribunal were to agree to an application by the near relative to succeed to the tenancy? What we are prepared to do, and what I undertake to do, is to look at how we can make this " greater hardship " phrase have greater substance and meaning—in other words, to give guidance, and to ensure that this type of situation is taken into account. If the hon. Member is purely concerned with this question of greater hardship which might befall the landlord, then we are taking that on board. What we cannot accept is that the landlord's son will be treated on an equal basis with the son of the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again, the landlord's son will apply, as will the tenant's son, and the Agricultural Land Tribunal will have to take a decision, all other matters being equal. This is the clear impression we have gained as being the hon. Member's intention from the wording of his amendment. My reply is that we cannot accept the amendment; we cannot accept the situation where the landlord's son will always have the right to apply for the tenancy. I gave the reasons for this to my hon. Friend who spoke about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>890</span>
position of the farm worker. We are talking here very narrowly about the question of hardship which arises in relation to a near relative. We are conscious of the need to ensure that social justice takes place, and because we want this phrase "greater hardship" with reference to landlords to apply and to have some meaning, I have indicated we are looking at the possibility of defining this question of "greater hardship" more adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I have some clarification? I am surprised the hon. Gentleman has not shown more sympathy to the amendment. There could be a landowner who has only one or two farms in addition to the one which he is farming himself, and whose son, who has been away on a colleague's farm, working and learning, then reaches the age when he wants to stand on his own two feet and wants a farm of his own to pay his own way in life. It seems to me somewhat unfair that the landowner cannot have his son treated on a basis equal to that of whomsoever is applying to succeed to a tenant on one or two other farms. It would seem there is a very good case for the son of a landowner to have an equal chance to take over the farming of that land which belongs to his father. While I accept some of the assurances the Minister has given, does he appreciate that there are some occasions when there would be justification for treating the son of the landowner equally with whomsoever is trying to succeed to a tenant of a farm?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This legislation seems rather biased, and we want to have from the Minister that flexibility which he promised at the beginning of these debates. He has disregarded this amendment too easily. I know he has said he will try to work out some arrangement under the hardship clauses where the landowner is concerned. I am not sure that that includes the case I have put to him, which could occur in the future, particularly for the small landowner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure what the Minister means by what he is going to endeavour to do, although I can see that perhaps he is going to do it in the procedures and regulations laid down for the Agricultural Land Tribunal. I hope he will be a little more explicit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>891</span>
As I understand it, my hon. Friend' amendment does not try to give the landlord's son a greater chance of inheriting the tenancy than any other applicant, only an equal claim. I put this case, which has occurred quite frequently—where a farmer, who is an owner-occupier, has died, leaving a son of 14 or 15. The widow has let the farm to an older tenant, may be a neighbour who is, perhaps, 60, thinking that by the time he is 70 the son will be 25 and he will be able to take over that farm which was their owner-occupied farm. The Minister has always said he does not think there is a very large number of hardship cases and that he wants to try to help the hardship cases. Here is a case which is quite frequent, where the son, having grown up, having worked on a neighbour's farm, having gained his experience, would endure a great hardship if he, the son of the former owner-occupier, should not be entitled to inherit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other farmer to whom one might have let it might have a few thousand acres with several farms, perhaps for his sons or relatives to inherit. This might be a moderate-sized farm of 300 or 400 acres. In this case the Minister ought to consider it a case where the landlords should be considered on all fours with any other applicant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will be a little more forthcoming about this. I think he does see some of the dangers we are in in being too oppressive to a certain kind of landlord, the small landlord, who is very vulnerable on occasions like this. He has indicated he has sympathy with this case. Can he go further and say he will look at this before Report? There is here a very important principle, and we shall make much more progress from now on if we can have his assurance on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure what it was the Parliamentary Secretary said he would do. I certainly welcome what he said as far as it went, and as far as I understood it. Would he be kind enough to explain a little further exactly what he means about his review of hardship?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he talks about the review of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>892</span>
hardship situation of the landlord, will he also include in that hardship the hardship of the landlord's son or child? That is the crucial thing. Can he tell us that he is going to have a major review of the hardship situation which does not include the landlord, whom one could see is less prone to hardship, but does include the landlord's son, who, I should have thought, in many cases would be extremely prone to hardship?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage a situation where there is a farm of which the holding is in dispute. The tenant dies and his son is working on it. The son of the landlord may be working on a farm a few miles away and may want to farm it and may see no other opportunity of getting a farm except through the possibility of farming his father's farm. It seems to me we are getting into extraordinary country in saying the landlord's son who cannot find anywhere to farm is to be precluded from farming his father's farm. To me it seems unbelievable. Certainly, our intention is that a son of the landlord should be put into a position where he has the same rights as the tenant's son. I really do not see why we should differentiate between them. The hardship can be just as great for the one as for the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I myself have been in this situation in the past, in that the farm I live on was let, and my only real prospect of farming was to go and farm it. If this legislation had been enacted before that time, before the tenant of that farm decided he wanted to retire, I do not suppose I should ever have had an opportunity of farming and living where I now farm and live. It would be most unfair to rule out the child of a landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst we are firm on that, we are a little uncertain what the Parliamentary Secretary meant about hardship. Perhaps he could give us an undertaking that that will include a review of hardship as far as the landlord's son is concerned. If so, we should look a little more kindly on what he has said. With regard at the moment to our amendment, we feel very strongly on this, and are very disappointed that even though it has the backing of the hon. Member for Durham (Mr. Hughes) the Government are intent on throwing out this amendment. It seems a very great pity, and I fear we shall be inclined to vote on it, and I shall advise my hon. Friends to join me in doing so.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>893</span>
Before that, however, it would be very helpful if the Parliamentary Secretary would clarify what he said in his earlier remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not realised that the hon. Member is the son of a landlord. I suppose it is quite appropriate, so far as the discussion of these matters has acquired a class basis—[Hon. Members: " Oh. No."]—in the sense in which Marx would use it, that the hon. Gentleman should be the son of a landlord and I should be the son of a tenant farmer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make absolutely clear that I am a tenant farmer. It is all highly confusing. My farm happens to belong to my family but at one time it was rented. When the tenant left the farm I went to live there. So I am the son of a landlord, and a tenant farmer; but my landlord happens to be a close member of my family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I could not resist that comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give the landlord's son a statutory right to apply for the vacant holding on an equal footing with the tenant's close relatives would introduce major complications in our proposals. The central purpose, as I have reiterated, is to help a near relative of the tenant to apply to the tribunal. To incorporate this addition would confuse things and introduce a major complication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of greater hardship, we envisage that the son of the landlord will be able to appear before the ALT but will do so in relation to new Clause 11, as part of the landlord's case for repossession on the ground of hardship. It was to that that I was referring in saying we are happy to look at the position with regard to making this hardship aspect more specific and more meaningful in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recognise that where the landlord is able to take over the holding—and I am stating the obvious, but it must be said at some stage—whether it be because there are no near relatives or because the near relatives do not qualify on the basis of the criteria laid down—and they will not be infrequent—or because a landlord has successfully challenged the application of an eligible person before the ALT, then
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>894</span>
the landlord will be free to help his son to move in as tenant of the holding. Hon. Members opposite have to keep these things in perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must add my voice to those of my hon. Friends—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear the words which the hon. Gentleman interjected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I should not have spoken from a sedentary position. I was saying only that hon. Gentlemen opposite have now found their voices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should be clear that I speak in disagreement with the outmoded notion raised by him on a previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking in terms of hardship I felt that my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) did not put a particularly good case in talking about a landlord's son who is going to be married, when bringing up the question of greater hardship or greater need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite clear that it is the landlord's child who should be able to apply and it is not at all funny to indulge in Marxist references. I am endeavouring to deal with a fundamental matter in a straightforward way. I regard this whole discussion as an extremely serious one. I depart from the hereditary principle with great reluctance. I do not see any justification for excluding the child of a landlord in any context of what one would describe, hopefully, as a free society. No doubt this matter will be raised again on Report. I can but tell the Parliamentary Secretary and his hon. Friends that if at that time they want humour or whatever, they are inviting it and are due for it. It is not a matter which will go through at all easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) excused himself in terms of his own lack of adequacy for drafting and asked the Parliamentary Secretary to bear that point firmly in mind. A point that occurs to me is that the amendment introduces a point on which we must be very careful, and one which, I hope, the Parliamentary Secretary will take on board in terms of hardship. The situation could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>895</span>
be dependent on a conjecture of events and dates, whereby a child of a landlord becomes a landlord. That could happen quite easily when one is going to have to identify who is the landlord at what point in time. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary accepts and understands the point, even in the restricted context of hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the child of the landlord being considered for succession on all grounds, other things being equal, is absolutely elementary to the whole concept of free society from which we in this country are retreating very rapidly</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
