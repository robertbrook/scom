	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are also discussing the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 114, in page 25, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'In this subsection "relevant date" means the date on which the company has comptied with—
	<ol>
	<li>section 407 of the Act of 1948 (documents to be delivered for registration by oversea company when estabtishing a place of business in Great Britain); or</li>

	<p>No. 115, in Schedule 2, page 36, line' 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>Section 409 of the Act of 1948 shatt be renumbered as subsection (1) of that section, and after that subsection there shatl be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(2) If any change is made in the corporate name of an oversea company, the company shall, within the prescribed time, deliver to the registrar for registration a return containing the prescribed particulars of the change."</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. For the convenience of the Committee I thought it right to rise with regard to your selection of the new clauses and submit that New Clause 17 ought to be taken separately from New Clause 10 and the other new clauses which you have decided should be taken together with New Clause 10. I think that would assist the Committee because my understanding is that New Clause 17 deals with rather different matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. My own feeling would be that whereas the new clauses in the name of myself and my hon. Friends are related to a technical practice commonly known as "warehousing", which is essentially a tactical matter, the point about which the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) is concerned in New Clause 17 is a more strategic question of objective interest. I am sure that we would be wise to debate them separately. I do not think that it will involve any duplication of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for letting me know of their decision to raise this at the beginning of today's sitting. I am prepared to look at the matter. In the light of what I then read into it, and having discussed it with the hon. Member who is moving the amendment I will give a decision later. I should like to think that we shall reach it today, but I do not think we shall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a limited amount of time to deal with these amendments at our last sitting, more particularly because I had mislaid my notes, which took up at least one and a half minutes of the time available to the Committee. Perhaps I may therefore start by referring tc the main purpose of Clause 22, which is essentially to provide the Secretary of State with the power to control the use of undesirable or misleading names by companies incorporated overseas which establish a place of business in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will be empowered to serve notice on an overseas company to that effect. It would be an offence committed by the company and its officers if the company continued to carry on business under such a name more than two months after the notice had been served. We discovered a lacuna in the drafting subsequently because the clause provided that the Secretary of State could serve notice on companies only within six months after their registration under Part X of the 1948 Act, or within six months of the coming into operation of the Bill, if that was later. There was no power to deal with the situation of an overseas company which had been established here for a period in excess of six months and which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
changed its name to one which was undesirable or misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendments taken together is this. First, the Secretary of State can serve a notice regarding the undesirability or the misleading nature of an overseas company's name up to six months after either registration under Part X of the 1948 Act or on receipt of notification of a change of the corporate name. Secondly, since there is no present requirement for the Registrar to be notified of a change in corporate name by an overseas company under Section 409, this becomes an additional requirement and is effected by a consequential amendment, Amendment No. 115.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 113 is to provide that no notice under the clause shall be served more than six months after the relevant date. Amendment No. 114 goes on to define the relevant date as that on which the company has delivered documents for registration on first setting up a place of business in Great Britain. That is already provided for by the clause and the addition is that the alternative situation is prescribed; if the company has changed its corporate name the date on which the change was notified to the registrar is the effective date.—I have already stated the effect of Amendment No. 115.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that sets out the position for the Committee and I hope the Committee will feel that this is a desirable addition to the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has explained these points very clearly, having discovered his notes which he had mislaid last time. My immediate reaction to what he says is that this seems a sensible arrangement. Obviously, we shall need to consider his arguments between now and Report stage Perhaps there is a point to which I may return on clause stand part. But, other than that, we would not wish to oppose these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i></p>
	<p>No. 114, in page 25, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>`In this subsection "relevant date" means the date on which the company has complied with—
	<ol>
	<li>section 407 of the Act of 1948 (documents to be detivered for registration by oversea company when estabtishing a place of business in Great Britain); or</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
	<li>if there has been a change in its corporate name, section 409(2) of that Act (return to be detivered for registration by oversea company where corporate name is changed)'.—(	<i>Mr. Clinton Davis.</i>)</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received representations that there should be no time limit to Clause 22(I) because as long as an overseas company has complied with Section 405 of the I948 Act it would be unreasonable for it to be served with a notice under Clause 22(1) when it is well established in Britain. I have also received representations to the contrary—namely, that the time limit is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister would care to comment on the reasons why he thinks a time limit is necessary. I think he, too, will have received representations on the same lines. Some of the accounting bodies seem to be of one opinion while others take the other view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think that on balance, having listened to the conflicting views of people involved, that it is essential to have a time limit tc give full effect to the provisions of Clause 22. The position would otherwise be uncertain and uncertainty is not a desirable element to import into company law. I do not see any overwhelming reason why a time limit should not apply when it applies already in a large area of similar provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no immediate points to raise on this clause. I do not know whether there are any matters involved in this which the Minister feels he should be bringing to our attention. I have received a certain number of constituency cases of various sorts—or other Ministers' constituency cases—on this subject. On the face of it it seems that the clause is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0892">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
quite acceptable. Perhaps the Minister feels that there are any points which he would wish the Committee to consider because he feels they are controversial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I see no reason to add to anything that is set out in the clause, which is rather more articulate than any expression of mine. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Anything I say that is mildly denigratory of myself will always receive the rapturous attention and applause of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton). Modesty is only designed to hide superiority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is wrong there. He is forgetting the famous words of—I believe—Oscar Wilde: "Modesty is unbecoming in one so young". It was in that sense that I was showing slight amusement at his words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we want to get on to "warehousing" at some stage, I will not prolong the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I forget the origin of the quotation but it can be said that the hon. Gentleman is modest and he certainly has much to be modest about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but when I look around me I think that it is a feeling which can be shared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause must be read in a way complementary to Clause 22, which deals with the situation when an overseas company has a place of business in Great Britain and is required to register under the Registration of Business Names Act I9I6 if it carries on a business under a business name. The Bill would be diminished if we did not have the benefit of this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>USE OF PRESCRIBED FORMS FOR NOTICES, ETC. UNDER ACTS OF I948 AND 1967</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause gives us a little more cause for concern. It is concerned with the use of prescribed forms for notices and so on under the Acts of 1948 and 1967, and attached to it is a very large schedule—Schedule 1—to which we shall come in due course. That schedule takes up almost two pages in amending the two Acts to which I have referred, insisting that after—each use of the word "notice" the words "in the prescribed form" shall be inserted. That goes on all the way through Schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are concerned about this. I am not at all sure why it should suddenly be necessary in the Acts of 1948 and 1967, which have been in operation for so long, to insist on prescribed forms for the various notices under those Acts. Indeed, we are increasingly concerned that it should be necessary for people to use forms of a particular kind. Immense amounts of printing have to be undertaken as a result, and if there are subsequent changes the forms have to be amended. It may be profitable from the printing industry's point of view but I doubt whether it is necessary. It may be difficult to get the necessary form to ensure that the return is made in the manner prescribed by statute. I am far from sure that the clause is necessary, and I should be grateful if the Minister could justify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman invaribly seems to be dissatisfied with the clauses to which I have to reply. This is a technical clause. The use of prescribed forms makes it easier for the person required to submit the notice to ensure that all the necessary information has been included, for the Registrar to check the notice and for the searcher at Companies House to obtain the information he requires. That is why the use cf prescribed forms is considered necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Gentleman's specific point, forms have already been prescribed for the purposes of most of the provisions listed in Schedule 1. This was done in the Companies (Forms) Order 1949 as amended. But at present these forms have no statutory backing. The clause remedies this deficiency by providing that forms already prescribed in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0893">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
Order of 1949 shall be treated as having been prescribed by that Order, but as if in pursuance of the relevant provisions of the 1948 Act as amended by Schedule 1 to the Bill. It also enables forms to be prescribed for the purposes of certain provisions of the 1967 Act for which no forms have yet been prescribed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will clear the hon. Gentleman's mind sufficiently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation a little more. Clause 24 (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In so far as any of the forms set out in the Schedute to the Companies (Forms) Order 1949 are forms provided for the purposes of any of the provisions…they shatl be treated as from the coming into operation".</p></blockquote>
As the Minister says, this effectively gives statutory force to something which previously has not had statutory force. I am not at all clear why this change should be necessary, given that it has been going since 1949.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I am not quite clear about refers to "forms provided for" the purpose. I am not absolutely clear by whom they are provided. Are they always forms issued by the Government or are they forms which the individual may purchase and then return to the Government? It is not at all clear from the wording whether there is any scope for the individual to use privately printed forms or whether they are invariably forms which are provided by the Government printer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point arises on that which will also arise on Clause 25. Very often, if one does not have a sufficient number of copies of the forms nowadays one can actually run off the form on a Xerox machine and use that. Will the Minister confirm that this will in no way restrict that practice, which seems to be for the general convenience of the firms supplying the information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am advised that the forms can be provided by the Government but they can also be purchased from stationers. I think that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Why is the change necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is necessary because we have, in effect, prescribed forms without having the powers so to prescribe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>SIZE, DURABILITY AND LEGIBILITY OF DOCUMENTS DELIVERED TO REGISTRAR</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 16, in page 28, line 29, leave out from 'with' to first 'the' in line 32.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to discuss Amendment No. 7, in page 28, line 34, leave out from 'applies' to end of line 41.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are drafting amendments which seek to clarify the effect of the "grace" period provided under subsections (4) and (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 25 provides that the Secretary of State may prescribe requirements as to the size, durability and legibility of documents to be delivered to the Registrar and also provides that the Registrar may require the re-submission of documents which do not meet the prescribed standards. If a document were to be submitted near to the end of the period provided in statute for its submission, by the time the document had been resubmitted in an acceptable form the company, or its directors, as the case may be, could be in default and liable to penalties. A grace period has therefore been provided which would not count towards the calculation of any period of default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, subsections (4) and (5) provide that the grace period runs from the date on which the document was originally delivered to either the fourteenth day after notice has been served by the Registrar—notice to the effect that the document was not in an acceptable form—or the day on which the document is delivered in an acceptable form, whichever occurs earlier. This complicated formula
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
does not, in effect, offer a genuine alternative, as I am sure hon. Members will appreciate if they examine it carefully. No doubt it is something which hon. Members would have raised in the debate on clause stand part. Once the document has been re-submitted in an acceptable form, no further liability to a penalty arises. It is therefore meaningless to say that the grace period ends on the day on which the acceptable document is re-delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments redraft subsections (4) and (5) so as to provide that the grace period which does not count towards the calculation of the penalty for any default shall run from the date of original delivery to the fourteenth day after service of notice to the effect that the document was not acceptable. Amendment No. 116 is a paving amendment. Amendment No. 117 deletes paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one point to raise on this clause resulting from an appeal which has been made to me by an accountant in my constituency. He is concerned about the number of statutory instruments which specify the size, durability and legibility of documents delivered to the Registrar. He asks, I think quite reasonably, whether it would be possible for a list of the statutory instruments affecting these various documents to be published, perhaps on an annual basis, so that it is much more easy for those concerned to know exactly what is required of them. I should be grateful if the Minister could give a helpful reply on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other comment that my constituent makes—and having read page 28 I am inclined to agree with him—is that the drafting is immensely complex. It would have to be read time and time again to know what is required. It is one thing for Ministers and their officials and for Members of Parliament to wade through this type of gobbledegook because we are familiar with it, but it is quite another matter for practising accountants who are busy men and to whom time means money. I should be grateful if the Minister could bear these remarks in mind and see whether anything can be done to improve the drafting before the Bill finally reaches Reports stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentlemans' point was a clause stand part comment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
Perhaps if we dispose of the amendment the Minister can answer that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) about the complexity of the clause and its drafting are valid, but, as you suggest, Mr. Crawshaw, I should like to come back to them on clause stand part. That said, I fail to understand the purpose of the amendment the Minister has moved.

As I understood this clause—and it is complex—there were two grace periods provided for, first in subsection (4) and then clarified in subsection (5). The first was a I4-day period, if the document originally delivered was considered faulty by the Registrar. But there was then a further grace period if, on re-submission, the second document was again found faulty by the Registrar. Therefore, one could see this happening in three stages. First, a company sends in the necessary document to the Registrar; the Registrar does not like it because of its colour, size type or whatever and, therefore, he rejects it. There is a 14-day period in which the company has to re-submit and if it resubmits and again the document is considered faulty it is at that stage that subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>) comes into operation. In subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>), line 4, there is a reference to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a further document which in the opinion of lhe registrar does compty with such requirements".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, I took it that subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>) referred to the third stage in this complex chain and by removing subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>), which is what the Minister is suggesting, the third link in the chain is, in effect, eliminated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite certain, from what the Minister was saying, whether that is what he intended, but it is certainly the way that I would read the clause, both as originally drafted and as now truncated. Perhaps the Minister would explain further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the clause. I cannot blame him for that because I agree that it is very complicated. Even with the excellent notes I had I found it somewhat difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 25(5)(	<i>b</i>), which Amendment No. 117 deletes, does not add any grace period. If the document is in order there is no need for a continuation of the grace
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
period. That is the answer. Does that satisfy the hon. Gentleman or does he want me to go into a further explanation of the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee on this point but I think it is important that the clause is so drafted that everyone—and particularly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) has said, those outside this Committee who have to comply with its ghastly requirements—should understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, there is a 14-day grace period initially for the re-submission, but if the second document submitted is still not in the right size—the Minister said that everything has got to be in the legal size which is octavo—and, if the poor company has yet again to re-submit, at that stage Clause 5 (b) becomes operative and no specific time limit is stated in Clause 5 (b). Therefore, in 14 days, when the company has to re-submit for the first time, if its re-submission is incorrect it then has an appropriate time in which to find the green spotted paper which the Registrar has required. I should have thought that Clause 5 (b) was a necessary link in the complex chain being set up under this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to being corrected, I did not read into the clause that there was a second period of grace. The reason for the amendment is, as I have said, because the Clause does not offer a genuine alternative. Once the document has been re-submitted in the accepted form, no further liability to penalty arises. It is, therefore, meaningless to say that the grace period ends on the day on which the acceptable document is delivered. If I am wrong about this, I will write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on his general point, I agree that it is a complicated clause. It is a very difficult matter, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will realise. I am not defending complicated legislation or gobbledegook. I have attacked it enough when I have been free to do so. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I will look at the Clause again. If it can be simplified in any way it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could also use this opportunity, with your permission, Mr. Craw-
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
shaw, to give that assurance to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby). We will certainly see whether a list of documents can be compiled. A consolidated statutory instrument might make the prescribed documents easily understood by people who have to comply with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee on this point, I take it that the Minister has given us a firm assurance that he will look again at the tctality of this clause—we shall come back to that on stand part—and most particu-larly at subsection (5). Then, if necessary, he can bring suitable amendments before us on Report. I am sure that all the Committee would agree that it would be intolerable if a clause went out from this Committee or, following the Third Reading, from this House, which we had great difficulty in comprehending. If we have difficulty in comprehending it—and the Minister has been very honest about this and said that it is difficult to understand—how much more difficult will it be for the myriads of small companies up and down the land who will have to comply with its terms?

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few minutes ago the Minister was kind enough to say that he did not blame me and my hon. Friends for misunderstanding the clause. Based on that, I should like to come back to the totality of the clause in a short stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us on reading the first subsection of the clause must be filled with horror, because it states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"regulations made by the Secretary of State by statutory instrument may prescribe such requirements"—</p></blockquote>
as to documents delivered to the Registrar—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0896">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(whether as to size, weight, quality or colour of paper, size, type of colouring of lettering, or otherwise) as he may consider appropriate;"</p></blockquote>
The mind boggles—I am sure yours does, Mr. Crawshaw—at the excesses of officialdom that are inherent in those words. One can imagine a terrible stage when the Stationery Department is long on green paper so that it insists that every company up and down the land shall file its documents on green paper. It may be long on red tape, so everything will have to be wrapped up in bundles of a particular size and colour of tape so that these supplies may be got rid of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of the days of the East India Company, when there were three million civil servants in India involved in seeing that all the minutiae of the company regulations as to the running of our Indian Empire were fulfilled exactly. Ticket inspectors used to go up and down the trains collecting the numbers of every ticket that they checked. No one ever knew what they did with the numbers but they acquired bundles and bundles of little bits of paper. This was all part of the running of the Indian Empire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only imagine that if this clause comes into effect as drafted we shall see a myriad of unnecessary requirements being built up which will greatly oppress all those outside this Committee. When they look at this they will think "What on earth next?" They send in documents in a perfectly normal form, on legal-size paper and through some requirement of civil servants in the Department of Trade a notice comes back saying that they have to be on octavo or they must not be in 8 point type but in 10 point type: they must not be on grey paper, they must be on white paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, at a time when companies throughout the tand are suffering from unnecessary regulations, to pass this sort of mind-boggling, petty detail into law is unnecessary. I should be very unhappy if all the Minister tells me is that it was previously in another Act. I do not think that that excuses it. The best thing this Committee could do today, or that the House could do on Report, is to decide that the clause is unnecessary or, if it is necessary that there should be only one provision in it, namely that the documents
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
delivered should be legible. The only thing that the Registrar requires is that he should be able to read the documents sent to him. There is a follow-on of some detail, which is that in Clause 26, on which we shall later have a stand part debate, the Registrar is given power to accept information on microfilm. I support that. I think it is a perfectly correct modification, or innovation, for the filing of documents. However, such documents, once microfilmed, do not have to be durable and it is superfluous to require in Clause 25, line 3, that the documents should be durable when, in a subsequent clause, it is accepted that they should be microfilmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Minister can show evidence of pressing need for this clause we should seek to remove it from the Bill altogether. If it leaves this Committee as drafted company secretaries up and down the land will read it with horror and wonder what new officialdom we are requiring from them at a time when they desperately need to get out from under petty regulations and concentrate on producing more goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope very much that the Minister will follow the course suggested by my hon. Friends. At a time when we in the House have experienced frequent interruptions with our papers not being delivered in the prescribed form, when they often come not even in legible form due to strikes—to make such requirements is completely unfair on thousands of companies. Even in good times it is hard to get the paper that one asks for from the printers. I have had difficulty in my own business experience. Why put such an extraordinarily detailed provision into the Bill? Leave it to common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for recognising the problems to which I referred a few moments ago and I hope that when we reach Report stage he will come back with a fresh draft of this. I yield to none in my admiration of the expertise of parliamentary draftsmen, but from time to time Members of this House have to exercise some check on the kind of text that turns up in Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not weary the Committee by asking the Minister to explain the minutiae of the clause. I know that he would be able to do so with the expert advice that he receives from his officials. My purpose is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
to try not to have fun with the Minister or with the Committee, but simply to make a genuine plea that this type of gobbledegook and bureaucracy should be substantially modified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the undertaking that the Minister has given and I look forward to returning to what I hope will be a simple and clear clause when we consider the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the assurance that I gave earlier to meet the points raised and discussed on previous amendments. Although the reminiscences of the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) about the East India Company are interesting, I do not think they are exactly relevant to the clause. The hon. Gentleman has the ability to make extraordinary things appear to be relevant, but somehow I do not think that was the most relevant example at which he could have snatched. The hon. Gentleman has indulged in flights of fancy about the sudden burdens that the clause will put upon small companies or, indeed, companies in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands that the power to make regulations which is set out in the clause is necessary for a number of reasons. First, with the introduction of microfilmed documents delivered to the Registrar, standardisation of these documents is becoming increasingly necessary. The Registrar's experience is that documents are often delivered to him on paper of such poor quality that it cannot survive the treatment it is bound to receive from a public registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is listening. I cannot say that my words are exactly fascinating, because we are dealing with a small, technical point, and this is in specific reply to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Registrar's experience is that the print and manuscript insertions on documents delivered to him are often illegible. Therefore, this clause enables the Secretary of State to introduce regulations to deal with these problems. These will considerably help the task of the Registrar and make it easier for users of company files to obtain the information that they require.
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
In fact, a user group has been consulted and is fully in favour of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we be quite clear about this user group? What were the terms in which it expressed itself to be in favour of the clause. On two occasions in this Committee Ministers have said that they were sure that this or that group was wildly in favour of something, whereas, when we have probed further, we have found that was not the position. Which user group are we talking about? What does it comprise? Has it written to the Minister saying that this is a splendid clause? If so, I am mildly surprised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has certainly not written to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To whom has it written?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that is not my departmental responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I introduced that matter in a light-hearted way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to answer the hon. Gentleman's points. I do not treat this matter lightly. The user group to which I referred consists of the banks, the Law Society, registration agents, search agents, commercial and financial organisations, institutions, or whatever one likes to call them. There have been regular meetings of these organisations, and they have raised no objection to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had this happen twice before, and I am not very happy about the situation. The note that the hon. Gentleman has received may be illegible. Perhaps he should give notice that he will return it and that it should be brought back within two minutes. It is not good enough. If the Minister wants to support his argument by reference to outside bodies, he should make himself familiar with those bodies and their membership.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
We are told that they are commercial organisations. What commercial organisations are involved? We are told that they are in favour of the clause. Have they written categorically stating that they are in favour of it? I have not had any letters saying "We are wildly in favour of this clause". If the Minister is to rely on the argument that outside bodies are very much in favour of the clause, clearly we are interested. It may affect our decision whether to reject the clause in order to ensure that it is looked at between now and Report. The Minister has not given us a satisfactory answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not consider the answer satisfactory. I base my main argument not on the fact that the user group has approved and welcomed these provisions, but on the need to help the Registrar—he considers it necessary—and on the fact that it will also be of value to the public. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, when I listed the organisations which have had regular meetings, I meant that they have had regular meetings with the Registrar. It is the Registrar's job to ensure that the forms he receives are legible, can be understood, and are durable. The meetings are held on a regular basis. The Registrar has discussions with the organisations. It is his responsibility to ensure that both he and the public are assisted by having forms that can be understood, can be kept and, to use the popular phrase, are durable and legible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any of these bodies had objected, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would have been the first to have heard from them. I find it difficult to believe that, on a matter which, according to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, will create complexities and difficulties and make their life intolerable, the very people who will have to use the forms would remain silent and not inform the hon. Gentleman. I think that he exaggerates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have based my argument on the fact that the Registrar considers these forms to be necessary. It is in his interest and that of the public. Additionally, I base it on the fact that there have been regular consultations with the user group. In the circumstances—I am the last person to want to see any unnecessary documentation, bureaucracy or form-filling pre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
scribed by this or any other legilsation—I think that the hon. Gentleman's fears are groundless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am informed that the meetings with the user group are recorded in minutes kept by the Registrar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What exemptions from penalty will there be if the prescribed paper is not available to the firms concerned at the time? Is the Registrar likely to proceed against them? Are they to have protection from such proceedings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Registrar is an SS officer. I am quite sure that he ought to take such factors into consideration. If the paper is not available, he will take that factor into consideration. He is not an unreasonable person. He is no a storm trooper. He is not a dictator. He must act in a sensible and considerate manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that event, does the Minister accept that directors of companies are not dictatorial and that they, too, will act in a sensible manner? If so, why put down these harsh, unnecessary, and ridiculously detailed prescriptions against them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The further we have gone into the clause, the more unhappy many of us must feel about it. I suspect that goes for Labour Ministers as well. When we hear the Minister telling us that if the right size of paper is not available he is sure that the Registrar will not be unreasonable and will allow companies to use another size of paper, it is like the worst excesses of the war. One could imagine a shortage of toilet rolls and a prescription that a different size of toilet roll may be used by officers below the rank of captain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has introduced a new concept in defending the clause, and I should like to ask him a few more questions about it. Who is represented on the user group? How does one join the user group? May we take it from what the Minister said that the clause was actually submitted to the user group, that it was agreed by it 	<i>in toto</i> without any amendments, and that this agreement was formally minuted? How do small com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
panies join that representative user group? How do they become part of the body that the Minister consulted about the onerous provisions of this clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are matters of considerable interest to us. If the Minister implies that the user group will in some way be an official body, I am sure that many companies, which are not well represented and are somewhat ill-organised throughout the country, would like to know how they can be part of this user group and can, thus, officially make representations to the Minister. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would care to answer those questions before I go on to some more general observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Keep going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another point about the user group is that the banks are not a representative body. I suspect that is a comment with which the hon. Member for Luton, West (Mr. Sedgemore) would agree. I am glad that he has now joined our proceedings. Banks have a plentiful supply of all sorts and types of paper. If the Secretary of State were to say that this year it is not 8in. x 4in., but 7in. x 3in., the banks would probably have some. But the small company up in Durham or Glasgow—Glasgow is not perhaps the right example to take—may not have this variety of type, print, colour, and so on, that the Registrar may require. Clearly, those who feel that the provisions of the clause are onerous and who are worried about it will be the small companies, perhaps with a part-time secretary and limited time and money available with which to comply with these regulations. Merely to say that the banks and insurance companies agreed with them is totally unrepresentative. Let us hear more about the user group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that I was obsessive in my worry about the clause. The hon. Gentleman said that the Registrar must be able to read the documents which are sent to him, and so must anyone going to Companies House to check accounts, and so forth. I fully agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that, in my opening remarks, I suggested that if there were a pressing need for the clause—which I doubted—it should be confined to one point only—namely, that the documents
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
should be legible. Clearly they must be legible, but anything more than that is otiose. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will think seriously about the clause, accept that it goes too far, and will undertake to come back on Report with a truncated clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, we should like to know more about the statutory instrument. As I read the clause, it is entirely up to the Secretary of State to decide the size, type and colour of paper and that there is no appeal against that decision through this Chamber. Will the Minister assure us that the statutory instrument will be subject to positive resolution and that, therefore, if the requirements prescribed by the Secretary of State are thought to be excessive, companies will be able to make representations to their Members of Parliament who will have an opportunity to oppose the statutory instrument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Minister to say that we should not worry about the size of the paper because the Secretary of State will be reasonable, but, when this measure becomes law, it will be entirely up to the Secretary of State to prescribe all this ridiculous petty detail about the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he thought I drew a bad analogy with the East India Company and its three million officials. But if he were to read a book called "Pax Brittanica", which was wirtten about India in 1897, he would see that the point most strikingly made about the Indian Empire at that time was the pettifogging detail of the bureaucrats who were running it. That is a history lesson for us 80 years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a great pity if, in the 1970s and 1980s, we were so carried away by bureaucratic requirements that someone writing history in 80 years' time were to say that we had even got to the stage where the Secretary of State, who surely should have had better things to do, was prescribing the size of type, colouring or lettering to be used on company documents. It is unbelievable. If the Minister were to stand back from the clause for a moment and look at in it perspective, I am sure that he, too, would accept that it goes much too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would like to vote against the clause because it represents bureaucratic interference potentially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
carried to the extreme. But I suggest that we restrain ourselves in the hope that the Minister will come back with a greatly abbreviated clause on Report which will not put these potentially excessive burdens on companies—particularly small companies—or he is so carried away by the weight of my argument that he feels inclined to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentle man asks me to accept specific points. Frankly, he has put forward an unreal argument. It is extraordinary that we should apparently be dissing the color of paper. I am bound to say that, and I make no secret of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is that the documents have to be submitted. If the only requiremen were That they should be legible—that is what the hon. Gentlemen suggested—and the Registar said they were not legible and he asked companies to put them I a more legible form, there would be arguments about whether a document was or was or was not legible and whether the Registrar was being reasonable or unreasonable. Therefore, of necessity, we should still be arguing over the colour and size of paper, the type of lettering, and so on, which we are discussing somewhat exotically at some length today. The problems would still arise. In that sense, the power of the Register to prescribe forms will obviate that type of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman wants to to join the user group. I am sure that he would not be blackballed. I think that he would be valuable in any group, because his knowledge about these matters is great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The user group was formed three years ago as a forum for discussing modernisation. It is comprised of the main professional bodies which have a direct interest in the operating of company registration. It consists of the clearing banks, the Law Society, chartered accountants, corporate accountants, chartered secretaries, and so on. I hope that answers the hon Gentleman's question. The user group has regular meetings with the Registrar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not have been appropriate to include in such a user group representatives of small businesses which employ only one or two staff, because they, not the others, will have

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon.

Indeed, I think that it is the first that many hon Members have heard about it. If there is such a group, there is surely an argument for making its existence known. Will the Minister tell us whether this has previously been publicised at all? If so, has an opportunity been afforded to representatives of small businesses, for example, to sit on it? I am sure that many of them would welccme with open arms the suggestion that they should be represented on a user group which would enable them to make representations on whether this or that form is necessary, even in the limited area which we are now discussing. Will the Minister also tell us who decides should be on the user group? This is a matter of considerable interest to small businesses.

The hon. Gentleman, as a representative of the Opposition, can have the opportunity of consulting with it too, if he so wishes, and I am quite sure that he will wish to do so. I am a little surprised that the Opposition have not sounded out the views of the professional bodies already, because it is these professional bodies which are users—people who regularly use the companies registration office and are intimately concerned with what comes out of that office. If the user group suddenly has a change of heart and finds that what previously it has considered to be necessary is now unnecessary, I shall consider that before Report. I do not think I can be fairer than that. I have no desire whatsoever, and I speak quite emphatically on this, to condone unnecessary bureaucracy or too many forms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the user group have a secretariat? Does it have an address? Can he tell us where we get in touch with it? Where do we advise small companies who are not represented on this user group to go to make contact with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite clearly, my mention of the user group has interested, to say the least, Opposition Members. I am a little surprised that its existence has shocked and caused such consternation among the Opposition which I thought, obviously mistakenly, would know about it. I am not being sarcastic. I will undertake to give the details about the user group and to publicise its existence and let hon. Gentlemans know where they can contact it is that they can familiarise themselves with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that I have a deep and abiding affection for him, but will he not confess to the Committee that he had never heard of the user group until this morning? He cannot give the names of the members of it, its address, how often it meets and what
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
was the nature of the consultations. Can he tell me whether the Uxbridge Chamber of Commerce is a member of it, and, if so—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Sedgemore</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shersby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, there we are. The Minister should not pull the leg of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) by saying that we must know that a user group exists when it is quite clear that he had not the faintest idea this morning that it existed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may intervene at this point. It is a little unfair for my hon. Friend to be burdened with the whole of this argument about the user group, which is my departmental responsibility rather than his. Suffice it to say that the user group consults with the Registrar. I had the opportunity of meeting representatives of the user group when I went to open the company registration office at Cardiff. I am quite satisfied that, as a result of my discussions with it, that it has a very good relationship with the Registrar and that any matters which concern it are brought to the notice of the Registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group is not a statutory body. It is a body made up of the organisations which have most use of the company registration offices facilities and it would be quite impossible, in a situation of this kind, for the Registrar of Companies to consult every company, every chamber of commerce. It has never been suggested that he should do prior to this debate. I am sorry if the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) should feel a sense of isolation on the part of his own chamber of commerce, but I doubt very much whether they made representations to him. I stand to be reproved, of course, if I am wrong about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point has emerged from the debate. I think that we would do well to leave it and not pursue the matter into too much detail now. It is evident that the operation of the user group is not known to a number of hon. Members who take an interest in company affairs. Therefore, it seems to me that that is a matter which ought to be corrected and will be corrected. We will ensure that some publicity—maybe the publicity will be short-lived in its effect—is given to the existence, the work and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
sort of consultations that are carried on by the user group. I hope the Committee will feel that that is the best way of dealing with the matter, rather than to take up an inordinate period of time in this debate to discuss these matters of detail which the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the principles, and as my hon. Friend has already indicated, I, as the responsible Minister, will consider very carefully what hon. Members have said. As my hon. Friend has stated time and time again, we are anxious to arrive at a situation where we do not have disputation between the companies registry and those using it as to the legibility and the sort of documentation that is provided. This is particularly important at a time when we are seeking to modernise the procedures, with some degree of success, of the companies registration office. In no way do we seek to burden companies with unnecessary obligations. All I want to say to hon. Members is that between now and Report let them consult, let them satisfy themselves that what my hon. Friend has said is right. If he is not right about it, we are anxious to facilitate procedures which will ensure that the objections are taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of the user group is that it articulates feelings ablut the companies registration office where it is thought that the office is not operating in some adequately measure. Having said that I have to add that we would be ill-advised to reject this clause which is designed to facilitate procedures and not burden people with additional bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Ministers for saying that they will look at this again. In my opinion, what they have to do is to recognise that one of the errors running through the Bill is that it does not differentiate between largecomcompanies and very small businesses. Therefore, in attempting to provide regulations that might be appropriate for large concerns, it overburdens the small business in a way which the Committee finds it virtually impossible to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again, as we have worked our way through the Bill, this is the conclusion which we have had to reach. I should like to ask the Ministers whether, even at this stage, they could not find ways of introducing special provisions to protect small
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
businesses from intolerable burdens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene very briefly in this debate. I share my hon. Friend's ambition that we should not become bureaucracy-ridden and I agree with him that this clause does appear to be going a little far. But it might help the Committee if I was to say that it really is quite useful to small businessman and the small practitioner, and so on, to be able to go down to the Solicitors' Law Stationery Society Offide or to Jordans just round the corner, and buy a gross of forms which they know will be acceptable, which are in a standard form which the Registrar will recognise. All they have to do is to fill in the very simple details and sign it where it says so and send it off. I feel that it is helpful, especially to the small businessman and to the small practitioner, to know that there is a standard form which will be acceptable. I can see the thinking behind the clause and I can appreciate it. I do not think that it will create additional burdens for small businessmen. It is a help for them to know that a fairly simple, standard form, about which the professional body that advises them has had a say—something that I did not know until this morning—is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I back my hon. Friend entirely in his argument that we want to avoid excessive bureaucracy, but equally I know from my own experience that it has been helpful to know that one can buy cheaply a standard form which will be acceptable to the Registrar of Companies. Apart from causing extra work, I personally have found it helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson). I think that all members of the the Committee would accept that the availability of a standard form which the small businessman or the company secretary knows is acceptable is perfedtly all right. We would go along with that without any question. But Clause 25(1)—if we let it go forward as it now stands—gives the Secretary of State an infinite variety of powers going far beyond that of prescribing a standard form. It is the potential of the powers contained within that subsections to which my hon. Friends and I object. We are second to none, I believe, in saying that we do not wish to burden
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
companies with unnecessary administration. We also go along fully with the principle of efficient administration. But it still seems to me that the only necessity in the clause is that documents must be legible. The powers given otherwise to the Secretary of State are far too varied, far too complex and they presage an inordinate amount of bureaucratic and costly restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest, therefore, to my hon. Friends that we vote against the clause in the hope that if it is defeated we shall in this way ensure that the Ministers comes forward with a simpler and less bureaucratic clause on Report which will deal with the points which have been aired in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have an example already in Table A which sets out a standard form which people are probably well advised to adopt. But it is not essential that they should do so. This is an analogy which could be used by the Minister in solving this problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby) who had such affection for me—which is mutual, if that is any help—suggested, although I think he meant it jocularly, that I had never heard of the user group until today. May I tell him that that is not true. I heard of it three weeks ago, when I went out of my way to ask what it was. It would be true to say that I had never heard of it before then. I was not being ironic. I assumed that hon. Gentlemen—whom I know take a</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of Amendment No. 118 is to ensure that material accepted by the Registrar in non-documentary form, such as microfiche, shall have the same legal status as the original documents for the purposes of Section 426 of the 1498 Act. For the benefit of the Committee I ought to explain that the main effects of Section 426 are, first, that any person may, on payment of a fee, inspect documents kept by the Registrar; secondly, that any person may, on payment of a fee, receive a copy or extract of a document authenticated by the Registrar as a copy of the original; and thirdly, a copy so authenticated shall be admissible as evidence in legal proceedings and have equal validity with the original documents. The amendment ensures that material deli vered in non-documentary form constitutes a document for the above purposes and that any person may still inspect information or
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
request a copy or extract, whether it was originally delivered in documentary or non-documentary form. More importantly, authenticated documents of material delivered in non-documentary form also have equal validity for the purposes of evidence in legal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 119, 120 and 122 change the procedure for authentication of copies or extracts of documents furnished by the Registrar under Section 426 of the 1948 Act. They are required to accommodate the Registrar's practice of keeping documents in microfiche form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could ask the Minister for a point of clarification. It may more properly come within the stand part debate, but if the Minister answers it now it may shorten that debate. As I understand it, Clause 26, which is closely interlinked with Clause 25, means that if microfilm is delivered to the Registrar of Companies a company does not have to deliver documents in another form. The delivery of documents in microfilm form will therefore act as a substitute for the delivery of documents in normal paper form. I ask for clarification on this point, because in one of his speeches during the last debate the Minister said that under present legislation, even if documents were in microfilm, the paper documents still had to be retained for 20 years. What I want to establish is that under Clause 26 that retention of written documents will go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will still mean that documents will be retained in written form and in microfilm? Is that correct? I took it that Clause 26 meant that if a company delivered documents in microfilm rather than in written form, microfilm would be the only record. I have no objection to that, but I should like to hear the Minister's reply for clarification purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Registrar at present only has the power—and, indeed, the facilities—to accept material in documentary form. But when the process of microfilming Com-

	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
panies House records is complete, it may well be possible to accept material directly on mocrofiche, provided that it is compatible with the Registrar's viewing facilities, so that the information concerned is still available for inspection by the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, therefore, is intended to help companies who can put their documents in a film form. I may have misunderstood what the hon. Gentleman said previously. If so, I apologise to him. No paper documents are needed if documents are delivered in microfilm. This will be the only record. I am sorry, but the note I received said that all documents have to be kept in paper form for at least 20 years under the Public Records Acts. I took that to mean—as the hon. Gentleman took it to mean—that this was in addition to the microfilm, but I am assured that that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee for more than a moment, but we seem to be a little confused. Am I to understand that, as a result of this clause, the requirements of the Public Records Acts will no longer apply? I am a little worried, anyway, about the reference to 20 years. My understanding was that those Acts did not apply to company records. Indeed, Clause 12, (7) of the Bill mentions records being kept for six years. I think that I am right in saying that, even when we introduced the VAT regulations, which required records to he kept for three years, that produced some criticism. It is not my understanding that the 20-year rule applies at all in this context. Perhaps the Minister would confirm whether that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it applies. The Registrar assures us that it does apply. Perhaps we can clear this up later by writing or otherwise.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause essentially deals with the fees which are payable. I merely wanted to ask the Government whether it is their intention that the fees shall cover the full costs of the operation involved, We are greatly concerned with this kind of thing in the context of patent law and that area where the full cost has not always been covered.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can certainly assure the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) on that point. The increases which have taken place, starting with the companies fees Regulations of I973 which, under the hon. Gentleman's Government, prescribed a single fee of £50 for registration or new incorporation, the fee for registration of a change of name which was increased to £40 and the latest regulations, which were the companies fees Regulations—which I introduced in June last year, and which deal among other things with the increase of £20 for the fee payable on registration of the copy of an annual return—are all designed to raise the minimum fees to a level covering the costs of the Companies House operations. Of course, these increases would also act as a deterrent to irresponsible incorporations and would help in getting rid of moribund corporations or those which operate on a minimal scale and which do not require the assistance and advantages of limited liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came in for—to put it in its usual colloquialism—a bit of stick for increasing the annual registration fee by £20, but I am glad to have had the comforting remarks, at least today—I do not think that they were so forthcoming previously—of the hon.

It is evident, I should have thought, on any objective analysis of the position, that the fees which are charged should cover the costs of the operations carried on by Companies House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

These amendments make an alteration to the procedure for authentication of copies or extracts of documents provided by the Registrar under Section 426 of the 1948 Act. They are required as a result of the moving of Companies House to Cardiff and the use by the Registrar of microfiche facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 426, 	<i>inter alia,</i> requires the Registrar on request to certify that a copy of or extract from any document supplied by him is a true copy and pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
vides that such certified copies shall be admissible in evidence in legal proceedings as having equal validity with the original document. A problem will arise in this connection when the move to Cardiff is complete, in that copies or extracts furnished by the London office will be taken from the set of microfiche records kept there, rather than from the originals, since all original documents will be in Cardiff. It will not be physically possible for the Registrar to check that a copy so furnished is a true copy since he will not have the original with which to compare it. It would, therefore, be wrong to require him to certify that it was a true copy. The amendments, therefore, provide that each copy shall be authenticated by the seal of the Department to indicate that it is an official copy supplied by the Registrar and copies so sealed shall have equal validity in legal proceedings.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is concerned with "Criminal proceedings and enforcement" and would seem not only to deal with a number of technical matters in relation to default fines, but with criminal proceedings in relation to Section 111(1)(a) of the 1967 Act which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(proceedings for the purposes of which the Secrelary of Slate may disclose information oblained by him under his powers of inspecting a company's books and papers) shatt inctude criminal proceedings pursuant to or arising out of this Act."</p></blockquote>
One point arising from that is of some interest and perhaps the Under-Secretary could tell us what the position is. Are we to understand that under this clause, and the related Section 111 of the 1967 Act which is concerned with the security of, information which he has obtained? Exactly what restrictions, if any, are there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
on such disclosure in a court? One has in mind particularly some reoent cases where information has been disclosed before it has been made available to this House.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2) amends Section 111(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the Companies Act I967. Section 111 makes it an offence punishable by a fine or imprisonment, or both, for any person to publish or disclose any information or documents obtained in the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers to require the production of the books or papers of a company, unles the body concerned has consented to disclosure, or disclosure is made to a competent authority, or is required for certain specified purposes. This subsection extends criminal proceedings for the purposes of disclosure under Section III by providing that such disclosure may also be made for the purposes of criminal proceedings in respect of offences under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Gentleman's question, the Secretary of State can divulge information with a view to the institution of criminal proceedings for any offence under the Bill. This puts the Bill in the same position as the 1948 and 1967 Acts. It does not alter the position or give the Secretary of State any additional powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was not clear how these two tied together. Is it that the category of unregistered companies includes both certain overseas companies operating here and chartered companies? In short, I am not at all clear what the scope of this clause is in relation to this category of company. Could the Minister perhaps give us some examples of such companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to do so. This does not relate to overseas companies.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause follows undertakings which I gave to the Committee earlier and not only in relation to this Bill. As the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) will recall, I also gave an undertaking, when we were debating what was Clause 7 and is now Clause 9 of the Insolvency Bill, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
introduce a public register containing details of persons disqualified. The public register will he much wider than the one that could have been contemplated under the Insotvency Bill and it will contain details of persons disqualified, not only under Clause 21 of this Bill but Clause 9 of the Insolvency Bill or Section I88 of thc 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
Quite obviously, there will be considerable advantages for people who have dealings with companies to know from the public register of those who have been disqualified by the courts from being a director or taking part in the management of a company. The register will also indicate whether a court has granted leave to any such persons to undertake any particular post, notwithstanding their disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause provides that a court making a disqualification order, or a court granting leave, shall notify the Secretary of State of the particulars relating to the order or the grant of leave. The Secretary of State will be under a duty to maintain a register containing the information which has been notified to him by the courts. Equally important, when orders have expired the Secretary of State will be under a duty to delete those entries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register will be open to public inspection for which a fee will be charged. The object is that the register should be maintained by the Registrar of Companies. Copies will be made available for inspection at Companies House in London, the new office in Cardiff and also at the office of the Registrar of Scotland in Edinburgh and at the Bankruptcy High Court, together with the existing register of bankrupts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register will include particulars of all disqualification orders made after the clause comes into effect. When the order has expired the entries will be deleted. We think that is right because otherwise there would be a considerable injustice and unfairness caused to persons concerned if the entry were left on the public record. It is right that it should be expunged and it is wholly in accord with the philosophy of the 1974 Rehabilitation of Offenders Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I should make clear that the register will not include any orders made before the clause comes into effect. We have given a great deal of thought to this problem and although we have certain details about orders of this category, we have no way of ensuring that the details we have are correct and there is no way either of ensuring that we are fully aware of all existing orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
The reason for this is that there is no requirement at present on the courts of notify the Secretary of State when a disqualification order is made. Therefore, I think the Committee might agree that it would be misleading and unfair—at least—potentially to individuals concerned to include entries in the register which could well be inaccurate. We have taken the decision that the register will not include orders made before the coming into effect of the clause. It is fair to say, therefore, that the register will not initially be fully comprehensive but it will provide a most useful public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might now go through the new clause, subsection by subsection. Subsection (1) provides that the prescribed officer of any court making a disqualification order after the clause comes into effect, or granting leave in relation to such an order, shall notify the Secretary of State of the prescribed particulars of the order or grant of leave. I have already indicated the nature of the orders to which this provision will apply. The officer of the court and the particulars to be furnished will be prescribed by statutory instrument issued by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is envisaged that the details to be notified to the Secretary of State for recording in the register will include the name of the disqualified person together with a sufficiency of detail to identify him, the date of the order, the section under which the order was made, the period of disqualification and particulars of any leave granted by the court relating to the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that the Secretary of State shall, on the basis of the information supplied by the courts in accordance with subsection (1), maintain a register of orders and grants of leave. Subsection (3) requires the Secretary of State to delete relevant entries in the register when orders have expired and subsection (4) provides that the register shall be open to inspection and a fee may be charged. It is probable that the fee will be set at the same sort of level as the fee for inspecting the register of bankrupts which is currently 25p. Subsection (5) provides that such a fee would be prescribed in accordance with regulations, subject to the negative resolution of either House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this explanation of the clause will satisfy the Committee that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0911">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
have fully complied with the undertakings that I have given previously on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is, of course, a matter which the hon. Member and I have discussed in Committee on the Insolvency Bill and we understand that what he is proposing to do here is more comprehensive than he had in mind during our proceedings on the Insolvency Bill, because the new clause is concerned, not simply with disqualifications under Section 188 of the 1948 Act or the Insolvency Bill, but with disqualifications under Clause 21 of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I might ask him to clarify. It was not absolutely clear from what he said, what his intentions now are for the House in the Insolvency Bill. Will he propose to withdraw it and roll it up, so to speak, under this clause on the assumption that this Bill—which is lagging a little behind the other one—will go through, or will he knock it out at some later stage—perhaps in the House or Lords—or will he embody it in some consolidation measure? Precisely what are his intentions for Clause 9 of the Insolvency Bill? My hon. and learned Friends and I who were on that Committee—and no doubt other hon. Members—will wish to consider amendments to the Insolvency Bill on Report and it would be rather a waste of time if we go around amending Clause 9 of that Bill on Report and then discover that it is the Government's intention to knock it out later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the position of those who are already disqualified under previous legislation—the 1948 Act and now the Insolvency Bill, if it becomes an Act. I think, on balance, that what he has suggested is right. It would be wrong retrospectively to place on the register the names of those who have been disqualified. In any case, as he has pointed out, it would be very difficult to establish the precise facts on which to base the register without there being some danger that someone was placed on it who was not disqualified, clearly with very important consequences for the individual concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am not quite clear about is this. I am not sufficiently familiar with the law to know whether this means that the register will go on indefinitely without one
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
knowing whether it is comprehensive. Clearly, if this is to be a register it is important that it should be comprehensive. We can well see the case for a transitional arrangement, but are there some who have been disqualified for an indefinite period under earlier legislation or is a term normally set upon it by the court? If there are those who are disqualified for an indefinite period, is it normally the case that even so in practice—rather like the capital punishment problem or, rather, the murder problem—such people are actually reinstated after a reasonable or recognised period of time? Those are the main points with which I am concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, one further difficulty. It is clearly the intention of the Government, and I think it is right, that if someone is disqualified and then ceases to be disqualified his name shall be expunged from the register. But that does not really get over the problem because the register is known to have existed and therefore I imagine it is quite easy for anyone who wished to do so to take copies of the relative pages, and after the register has been revised and certain names have been deleted, effectively build up a non-public register of those whose names have been deleted from the register. That would clearly frustrate the intention of the Government and might be rather undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the Government feel—and I think they are right—that someone who has been disqualified and who is then reinstated will not wish it to be known that he has been disqualified and then reinstated. He may set up subsequently in business and become a director of a number of companies. Nonetheless, the historic information would still be around and it would be possible for a shareholder who happened to have a grudge, justified or unjustified, against the individual concerned—say a creditor under the Bankruptcy Bill—to stand up at the annual general meeting of the company, perhaps many years later, and say, "We cannot have any confidence in this chap being reappointed because he used to be disqualified". It is a real difficulty and I see no immediate solution. I am sure that the Minister has given this some thought. I wonder whether he has reached a conclusion. It is a difficult matter and I do not see the answer immediately, but we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
should consider it before we agree to the new clause which, unless the point can be tackled in some way, will clearly have this effect. People who are disqualified—despite the Government's intentions that that should not be held against them for ever—will be in some danger of being in that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loveridge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following what my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) has said, I wonder what will happen to the actual physical records when these are taken from the register. Will they be destroyed or will they be kept? If they are to be kept, where will they be kept and for whose information? Would they be available to the police under certain circumstances? What will happen with relation to the Press? Suppose a newspaper or other publication mentions the name, what protection is there to achieve what the Government actually want? Credit bodies will surely collect records for their own purposes and it is not unreasonable that they should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the registration by the courts, I take it that there is a maximum period for which a disqualification order can be made. is it incumbent on the court or has it discretion not to make any order in certain circumstances even if there is a conviction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The register of disqualification orders that is provided for in the new clause is an important development and we must treat it as such. Clearly, for any individual concerned in the management of a company—or having been concerned in the management of a company—to be named publicly in this matter—and this is what it amounts to—and for his name to be thus publicly and widely available as a disqualified person, is a considerable threat. I am not against it for that reason but I think we must recognise that it is a threat and consider very carefully the provisions of the clause to ensure that the threat is not used unfairly or that this stigma of having been on this list of disqualified people—which is like a list of those who have been banned from dealing on the Stock Exchange or a list of those who have been banned from the commodities market—does not endure unnecessarily and for too long, thus preventing people getting back into business again when the period of
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
their disqualification has elapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point that I would like to ask the Minister. This register of disqualification orders covers three categories of people, as I see it. It covers those under Section 188 of the 1948 Act who are restrained, as fraudulent persons, from managing companies. It also covers those under Section 9 of the Insolvency Bill who—speaking from memory—were connected with the management of two bankrupt companies within the period of five years, and thus are also disqualified from taking further part in the management of companies. Now, under the new Companies (No. 2) Bill it covers those who are disqualified for persistent default in relation to delivery of documents to the Registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit to the Minister that there is a considerable degree of difference in these three sins, for want of a better word. In my judgment, that under the Companies (No. 2) Bill, however irritating to the Registrar and however worrying to creditors, is a much more minor sin than that covered by the 1948 Act and arguably by the Insolvency Bill, because I have always felt, in relation to the Insolvency Bill, that someone could unwittingly be connected as a director with a company that was going bankrupt and that he might be caught by the Insolvency Bill through no fault of his own, whereas the 1948 Act specifically refers to fraudulent persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would make abundantly clear in replying that the classification of the individual, the reason he is on this register, must be made plain in the register. It would be wrong if somebody who was temporarily disqualified for failing regularly to deliver documents were to have attached to him the odium that would come from being judged to be a fraudulent person. If this were to happen, it would be quite wrong and it could vitiate the purpose of the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point flows on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) said, that when an individual has been on this register for a certain period it is obviously fair that, when his period of disgrace has ended, his name should be expunged and he should be able to earn his livelihood again as an active manager or director in business. One would not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
wish to penalise him indefinitely. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing asked, is there therefore to be a prohibition against taking photo-copies of the register in this instance? I seek clarification from the Minister, who I am sure has thought this point out. If photo-copies are permitted to be taken, there would then be considerable power in the hands of individuals to point a finger in years to come at someone who was temporarily on this register and to say to those in a business circle in a small town "You should not do business with that chap. He was on this register for a period of time. Here is a copy of his entry. He is not someone you want to be associated with." This could become a lasting stigma for an individual that he would find very difficult to live down when, perhaps, it was only persistent default in delivering documents that caused him to get on to the register in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, therefore, that it is necessary for us to consider how the erasure of a person's name from the register should be made a determining factor so that the odium does not last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads to the final point concerning the Public Records Office provision in relation to this register. Although a person's name is officially removed from the register, will it remain within the Public Records Office for the period of 20 years as having been on the register during, say, the year 1977 although it has been expunged from the register of 1979?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general terms for one, support the register. I think it is a powerful deterrent for those running companies. They should be aware of the fact. But I think we must make it clear that it should not become more of a stigma than it is intended to be, and clarification from the Minister will be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this has been a useful debate. As the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) has said, this is an innovation and I believe it to be a wholly worth while innovation. There is a necessity on the part of the public to have the ability to determine which directors or other persons within the scope of these provisions have been disqualified. Uncertainty, and indeed ignorance, has led to a good deal of distress in the past.
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
As I have said on other occasions, hon. Members on both sides have raised this matter on numerous occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) asked about my intentions with regard to Clause 9 of the Insolvency Bill. He presumably does not have the Insolvency Bill before him at present. I have the advantage of that, but he will recall that I had given an undertaking to consider the introduction of a register with regards to the limited provisions applied by Clause 9. The register does not appear in the Bill at present. This was to be dealt with on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall have to consider—now that both the Insolvency Bill and this Bill look as though they will have to be dealt with in the spillover—which Bill we should introduce first. I am not committing myself to a view at this stage, but there is some merit in introducing the Companies (No. 2) Bill [Lords] first so that we shall have dealt with the register. I do not think that there would be any disadvantage in adcpting that procedure. However, I do not want to close my mind to the available options at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) agreed that it would be wrong for the provisions to have retrospective effect. He asked me specifically whether the register would go on indefinitely without being comprehensive. That is connected with his subsequent point relating to a term set on disqualification. There is no indefinite disqualification. The disqualification is determined by the courts. There is a limit in respect of any single disqualification of five years. Therefore, within five years of these provisions taking effect, we should at last have a comprehensive register. Until that time, the register will not be wholly satisfactory for the reasons which I have already explained, but I believe that it remains a useful public service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the difficult matter—I do not hide the difficulty—of persons having access to the register before a name has been expunged from it in circumstances which would justify that course being taken, I do not see that there is any easy solution. If one were to prohibit photocopies being taken—which is a possibility—this could be wholly negated by someone making a personal search of the register—which he is clearly entitled to do: the whole purpose of the register is to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
make the information available. He could write down the information, or cause an agent to write it down. Therefore, that would not be a useful addition to the proposals which we have made. Anyway, there is always the possibility of people having remarkable memories. People like judges have remarkable memories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are all agreed that this is a difficult point. Seeking to help the Minister, if I may be so bold, does not he agree that there is, perhaps, a degree of difference between a written or typed note representing somebody's memory of a search of a register, and an actual photocopy, because a photocopy is proof that a document existed at a certain time? Speaking purely as an individual, I should be more impressed by a photocopy than by a note saying "X went to look at the register, and this is what he found". There is something more definitive about a photocopy. The Minister may have other ideas. Perhaps he will think further before Report about how to deal with the business of expunging names. But, on balance, I think that there is a case for prohibiting photocopies, whilst fully accepting that, of course, people will take notes and will write them up afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a question of evidence, and what stress is attached to the available evidence. I will certainly consider further the point which has been made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) before Report. Because I think that the whole Committee will be interested in the matter, it might be appropriate if I write to him and send copies to other hon. Members of the Committee about my conclusions so that they can be forewarned before we deal with the matter—or do not—on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a unique problem because, of course, it is possible for people to become aware of judgments and then for judgments to be discharged with information that a person has been a judgment debtor, although he has discharged his judgment, continuing to be available on the part of those who wish to exericse or even perhaps, if I may use the term, abuse their power in relation to other individuals, thereby retaining the stigma that this sort of thing attaches to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have quite a considerable problem
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
and, anyway, we still have the problem with regard to convictions notwithstanding the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. Of course, there are sanctions about using information relating to convictions which fall within the scope of the Act, it is perfectly true. Nevertheless, information about convictions can be culled from newspapers or personal attendance at court and abused in that way, and damage can be done although, of course, there is a legal remedy available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Upminster (Mr. Loveridge) asked me where the records which had been expunged would be kept. In the fireplace, I think, until such time as it is cleaned out and the ashes distributed wherever they are distributed by the companies registration office, or however else these things are destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with the point about the period of disqualification that the hon. Gentleman raised. There is no mandatory requirement on the part of a court to disqualify. It is a matter of discretion, and the court will always have discretion. I shall come back to that point in relating certain observations to the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex. He said, rightly, that it was a considerable threat to people to be named as perons who had been disqualified. Yes, it is intended to be a very serious deterrent, and all the provisions I have referred to ought to be read together in this respect. It is a war against people who abuse their position in one way or another, and it is a war which is being fought on behalf of the public at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to use these powers unfairly and, of course, there is a check. The check is the courts. The courts will not disqualify lightly, and they will not do it unnecessarily. If the decision of the court of first instance does not meet with the approval of the defendant—and it very rarely does—the defendant will have the right to become the appellant and appeal to another court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that the register is based upon disqualifications based upon three different sections of the law, and the hon. Gentleman cited the provisions in question, as I had done earlier. What I cannot go along with him in ascertaining is when he refers to persistent default as "only" persistent default. Persistent default, within the terms of the provisions that we have now agreed, is a very serious matter. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0915">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
means that the public is being disadvantaged and prejudiced seriously—or potentially so—by reason of the persistent default on the part of a director or other person in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman says "only" persistent default, I beg him—and I have asked him to do this before—to recognise that this is a matter where the court is exercising its discretion in the final analysis. It is the court which says that the offence is so serious that it justifies a man being disqualified for a period of time up to a maximum of five years. It is the court which will have to take upon itself the task—as it always does—of adjudicating upon the special facts relating to a specific case. Therefore, any disqualification must be based on a very serious state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman's analysis of the position that a disqualification based on Clause 21 is necessarily of a lesser order than a disqualification based upon the other provisions. It must depend upon the facts, and no doubt the facts will be reflected in the sentence passed by the court, including the period of disqualification which a court will attach to any individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt with the other point raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex out of order, but I think I have covered all the points raised by members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is the case that very often Government Ministers, together with their officials, decide that some change in the law or some change in taxation, or whatever it may be, is necessary. In the course of doing that and in seeking to implement what they propose, they devote an immense amount of time to getting the thing as right as they can make it. I am reminded of the legislation on value added tax or a number of other taxation changes. None the less, it is always the case that, in a curious way, a Committee of the House of Commons very often sees a series of snags which are not apparent, however assiduous the Minister and his officials may be. Therefore, I think we are right not to rush matters on this new clause because an
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
outside view away from those who have been working hard on it for months or perhaps even years may be helpful to ensuring that we get the right legislation, not simply on drafting or something similar but on more fundamental issues, a number of which are already beginning to emerge. The Minister and his officials and those of us on the Opposition benches or back benches opposite, will want to go into this further between now and Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Curiously enough, a question arose in my mind when listening to the Minister's reply which had not really arisen initially because we had been referring to this gradually as we went through the Bill and then through this Bill. I had almost taken for granted that there was a case for a register, and I am not sure that I had thought through sufficiently its usefulness, or what its usefulness precisely should be. If a particular individual is now disqualified under existing legislation, in a sense that is known. He comes before a court, and he is disqualified. In the case of the register, therefore, it is not that the people immediately concerned do not know that he has been disqualified but that some broader group will know that he is disqualified. Therefore, one must ask oneself precisely in what way this register can be used and perhaps also abused. That is really the point to which we have turned in this discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has also been rather close to this and, therefore, may get into the situation of seeing the trees but not the wood. Perhaps it might be helpful if we would have his view on exactly which categories of person he thinks will use the register. Obviously, in the case of insolvencies it might be those who are concerned with credit rating. But, apart from those, it might be those who are concerned with persons who have been disqualified, for example, because of persistent default in relation to the delivery of documents, who will use the register, as opposed to the Government who will wish to ensure that a person who is disqualified does not start up a new company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, at the moment the Government are in a position to do that, anyway, or at least the individual concerned knows that, if he starts up again while disqualified, heavy penalties will follow. So it is presumably not the Government who are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
immediately concerned with the register except from the point of view of convenience. Therefore, I pose the simpleminded question again for the reasons I have mentioned: precisely which categories does the Minister see using the register, as against abusing it, and I will ccme to the possible abuses in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) which the Minister has commented on with regard to the various possible offences—if that is the right word—which may result in someone being disqualified. I find the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex very powerful. I think there is a real distinction between someone who is guilty of persistent default in returning records and so on, which previously has not in any way been regarded as an offence, or at least not one which deserves punishment, and someone who, under the provisions of the 1948 Act, is guilty of fraud—something which over the centuries has always been regarded as reprehensible and probably deserving of punishment. The two are very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we take the middle one, the question cf bankruptcy, which we have debated at great length on the Insolvency Bill, it brings out the fact that we shall need to look with even more care than we are already at those provisions in the Insolvency Bill which may result in someone becoming bankrupt—particularly with regard to becoming bankrupt, sc to speak, automatically. The new clause lends weight to the need to ensure that the Insolvency Bill provisions are adequate and that there is not some danger of someone becoming bankrupt and being put on this register of disqualified directors almost inadvertently, which I think is the case as the Bill stands at present. Again, it reinforces the point made by my hon. Friend that there is a difference of considerable magnitude between those who are disqualified for one reason, say bankruptcy, as against those who are disqualified for default or those who are disqualified for fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I wonder whether we should consider whether the new clause should read not "register of disqualification orders" but "registers of disqualification orders", and whether there should be three separate registers, or at any rate, a register which is divided clearly into three separate categories. The implications
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
of being on one part of the register or another are very different. I do not know that there is any such category as deserving bankrupts, but certainly there are those who may become bankrupt through misfortune.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps on missing the point. It is only in the serious matters where the court considers that the conduct of the person concerned is so aberrant that it justifies disqualification that the court will act. We are not dealing with cases of misfortune. That cannot possibly arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had waited a moment, I intended to make precisely that point. None the less, the court may on balance decide that there was misfortune combined with other factors and the person became bankrupt. It is still very different from simply not sending in documents. I suggest that it is a more serious offence than persistent default in sending in documents. On that, I go along with the Minister. Despite some doubts about it the Committee went along with Clause 21 and agreed that persistent default in relation to delivery of documents was a very serious offence. But I do not think that anyone in the Committee, being asked if they thought this was more serious than fraud, would have said so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or as serious. There are differences in degree here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reinforce that argument and persuade the Minister of its strength by coming to the other main point which has been raised, namely, whether, if someone's name is on the register, it is possible to have it properly expunged. Clearly, if that is not possible—and we can all see the practical difficulty—the argument for having three different categories is remforced. It may be that someone will say that he was disqualified. The immediate reaction will then be to ask what was he disqualified for. If there is a single register, the implications is that it is fraud. The person who is given that information will have no means of ascertaining, without an immense amount of research or perhaps at all, whether it was for fraud or for something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will refer to subsection (1) of the clause, which sets out the details that will have to be provided—we envisage, rather, the details to be notified—which will include, as I said in relating my remarks to subsection (1), the section under which the order was made and the period of disqualification. All these matters will be identified very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point which the Minister is making, but I am not talking here of a first-hand examination of the register. What I am talking of here is someone who, perhaps 10 years after the event, says that this man's name was on the list of disqualified directors. The person will not necessarily know enough about it to say exactly what was the reason, and so on, and he cannot himself check because, if I understand the position correctly, the record will have been expunged. If a person says that he recollects that it was for fraud, that is a rather more difficult one to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings us to the other matter, which is the question of how it is possible, if at all, to expunge the record. As I understand it, the record will go into the Public Record Office—and we were referring on an earlier clause to the fact that, apparently, these records go on for 20 years. Given the difficulty with which we are faced here, is there a case for considering whether, when the name is expunged from this register, it is also expunged literally from the reccrd, including the record in the Public Record Office? I do not know whether there is any precedent for that. There are, obviously, very complex arguments about whether the Public Record Office should have a record of what happened in detail, or whether some of the items should be deleted from it. I imagine it has probably, in some context or other, come up before. At least, I think the Minister should consider whether special provision should not be made whereby the actual record shall be expunged not just from the register but from the record of the register in the Public Record Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context, the point which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex made is very important. There is a distinction between someone simply saying that they recall or that they took a note of the fact
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
that someone was disqualified and an actual Xerox copy of the entry. I think we should consider whether provision should be made that the register should not be photocopied or, perhaps, that it should not be allowed to be photographed. This might be very difficult to administer. On the other hand, unless someone is doing so with a particular intention for some time in the future in an individualca se, it will be fairly difficult for him to sit there with a little Minox camera and photograph page after page after page.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all worried about the broad point and, therefore, it is a question really of how best to implement the proposals which the Government have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend would agree with me—and I am following his argument with great interest—that there seems to be a matter for clarification here. As I understand it, although someone's name would be expunged from the register, let us say, in 1979 after his period of disqualification had lapsed, his name would still be on the 1977 register and, therefore, there would be a permanent record of this person's disqualification which anyone, by asking to see the 1977 register, could always find.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the Minister say "No", but I wonder whether my hon. Friend agrees with me that, at the moment, there is this area of overlap and that, by looking back at a historical record, one could always find out, and perhaps photocopy, that someone was on the register in 1977, even if his name was removed in 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, from a sedentary position, said "No". I will not provoke him into intervening now, but perhaps he will clear this up when he comes to speak. We will be happy to be reassured on this point, but certainly it would appear that the position is that, although a person's name is expunged from the register, the actual official record will still be available. It is a distinction between "Who's Who" and "Who was Who", or the reverse of that set of volumes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which arises here is that this register is not like some other records.
