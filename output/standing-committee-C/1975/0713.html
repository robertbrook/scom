	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned my hon. Friend was on his feet and about to reply to the request for an explanation of the clause, a request made by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins). My hon. Friend is unfortunately detained at a meeting. He will be here shortly. Perhaps I could give an explanation in his absence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires overseas companies to prepare accounts in respect of each accounting reference period and file copies with the Registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 410 of the 1948 Act already requires overseas companies to make out accounts once a year and file copies with the Registrar, but for the accounts of British companies the existing requirements are difficult to enforce and widely disregarded. New arrangements for filing accounts are, therefore, being applied in this Bill to overseas as well as British companies. The accounts have to be made up in the same way and must contain the same information as the accounts of British companies except to the extent that any exceptions or modification are prescribed. If the accounts are not in English, a certified translation also has to be filed, and there is an exemption for certain unlimited companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain each subsection briefly. Subsection (1) requires that every overseas company shall prepare accounts in respect of each accounting reference period. Accounts must include a balance sheet, profit and loss account and, if the company is a holding company, group accounts, and must cover the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
period and contain the same particulars, subject to any exception and modifications which may be prescribed, as if the company were registered under the Companies Acts. This is similar to the existing requirement under Section 410 of the 1948 Act except that in future accounts will have to be made up in respect of each accounting reference period instead of, as at present, once in each calendar year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Overseas Companies Accounts (Exceptions) Order 1968 grants overseas companies certain exemptions from the normal requirements as to the contents of accounts. Overseas companies are not required to produce a directors' report and they are exempted from the provisions of Sections 3 to 8 of the 1967 Act which require companies to disclose information about their subsidiaries and ultimate holding company, directors' emoluments and salaries of higher paid employees. They are also exempted from the requirements to disclose turnover and give details of the United Kingdom corporation tax liabilities. It is expected that similar exemptions will be granted under subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) requires overseas companies to deliver to the Registrar a copy of the accounts which they are required by subsection (1) to prepare, together with a certified translation of any document not in English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) exempts certain overseas companies with unlimited liability from the requirements of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) provides that Section 410 of the 1948 Act, which is superseded by this clause, shall cease to have effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that explanation will help the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been helpful in outlining the main points about the clause. There are some subsequent points on timing which we shall come to later. In subsection (2) we find
	<br><blockquote><p>"a printed copy of every balance sheet."</p></blockquote>
Do the Government intend to persist with that as far as overseas companies are concerned or would the Minister indicate whether some suitable amendment will be moved on Report? If the Government do not move one, we shall. It might be helpful to know whether they propose to do so, or whether in the case of overseas companies there are any special
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
reasons why these should be printed. I presume that the translation of the documents can be in any form. Is that so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not quite catch what the Minister said, but I thought he said that a company would have to produce a statement of United Kingdom corporation tax liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it would not have to. It is exempt from having to do so, and, no doubt, under the regulations that exemption will continue to apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might press the Minister on that. Precisely what is the position? Is the company to be subject to corporation tax or not? This raises deeper problems, involving double taxation and so on, and I would not necessarily expect the Minister to answer off the top of his hcad. Could he repeat or extend the point he made. I would like to consider it when it is available in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I gather from what he said that this is the existing position and that it is not being changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that. I was pointing out that the existing position is that under the Overseas Companies Accounts (Exceptions) Order 1968 certain exemptions are granted from the normal requirements to overseas companies as to the contents of accounts. Under that order overseas companies are not required to produce a directors' report and they are also exempted from the provisions of Sections 3 to 8 of the 1967 Act which requires companies to disclose information about their subsidiaries and their ultimate holding companies, directors'emoluments and salaries of higher paid employees. They are also exempted from the requirements to disclose their turnover and give details of the United Kingdom corporation tax liabilities. It is intended that the same exemptions will continue to apply under this legislation. I thought I had better repeat the whole passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot answer the technical point about liability for corporation tax. I will write to the hon. Member about it, but the Bill is not concerned with taxation and does not affect the taxation position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The translation can be in any form. With regard to printing or otherwise there is no special reason why overseas com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
panies should be treated any differently from British companies in this respect. They will be treated in the same way. We have had a long debate about printing and I cannot quite remember where we ended up. We are back to where we started. The same conditions will apply to overseas companies as apply to British companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely clear where the question of timing comes into this set of clauses. Is it the case that the accounts prepared by overseas companies will have to be produced in exactly the same time as accounts produced by other companies, or is there a longer period to enable the tie up with overseas operations to be taken into account? Obviously there is a specification of the actual accounting period of the overseas companies, but I am wondering whether the Government propose that such companies should stick exactly to the same timetable and have to produce accounts at exactly the same speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Overseas companies have 13 months. They are treated as though they were private companies with overseas interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PENALTY FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH SECTION 9 WITHIN THE PERIOD ALLOWED FOR DELIVERING ACCOUNTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only comment I would make is on the penalty specified in subsection (1) that the company and every officer or agent of the company who knowingly and wilfully authorises or permits default because of the overseas company's failure to file its accounts in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
time shall thus be guilty of an offence and liable to an aggregate of a£400 fine and£40 for each day of the default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the Committee has already been over the ground of the extent of the fine. I do not wish to canter over that territory again. The Minister will be relieved to hear that. I am concerned with the degree to which a company based in the United Kingdom can effectively control its overseas officers to make sure its accounts are delivered in the time required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a let-out here in the words "knowingly and wilfully", but there could be ground for considerable disquiet in a company which has some overseas trading subsidiary in a particularly remote part of the world, in the Yemen, perhaps, or some distant African territories, or even Uganda, where there is limited accountancy available to the overseas company, where there are few auditors and many demands on their time. In these circumstances it could be difficult for the company to produce accounts for all its overseas subsidiaries within the required time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, these penalties of an aggregate of£400, £40 for each day of the failure, seem to be particularly severe. We have in Britain, and it is part of our tradition, a number of very large international trading companies, which contribute a great deal to our invisible balance of payments, and which are part of our commercial tradition. t would be worrying if they were to feel that, because of the penalties of subsection (1), they were limited from expanding in a particularly remote territory where they might see good, if distant, prospects of business—limited by being not too happy that they would be able to comply exactly with the accounting reference periods for their overseas companies. Would the Minister care to answer that point and perhaps say that it has been taken on board by his officials?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that the hon. Member was galloping rather than cantering. He pointed out that it is the company and every officer or agent who knowingly and wilfully allows a default who will be liable if an overseas company is in default. This is in contrast with the case of the British company, where it is the directors. If matters are not within the officer's control he has not committed an offence. In
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
every case it is for the prosecution to prove that the officer had personally failed to do all in his power. If the prosecution does not discharge that heavy burden, the officer will not be liable, although the company may still be guilty of an offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made an interesting distinction which I failed to pick up from reading the clause. Do I understand him to say that the company may be guilty in circumstances when the officer is not? That strikes me as an extraordinary distinction. Surely it is the officer acting on behalf of the company, obtaining the accounts for the overseas company and seeing that they are audited and available within due time, who is guilty. It is hard to imagine circumstances in which the company could be guilty without the officer also being guilty because, a 	<i>fortiori,</i> if the officer is not guilty it is hard to see in what circumstances the company is guilty. Presumably, the officer would not be guilty for the reasons I painted earlier—the accountant overseas was sick or the auditor was not available and a major delay occurred; but in those circumstances the company would also be excused, and neither the company nor the officer would be liable for the fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To give the Minister time to consider his answer, may I ask him this? As he rightly points out, there is a distinction between a company and "every officer or agent of the company". A penalty is imposed for the company's failure to comply and, apparently, there is also a penalty for every officer and agent of the company. The drafting is a little curious. Whereas the clause provides that if the requirements are not being complied with before the end of the period, the company and every officer or agent of the company are guilty of an offence, the subsequent passage refers only to the company's failure. In that situation, apparently, both the company and the individuals concerned are guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding the aggregateof £400 and£40 for each day. In most cases which we discussed earlier, there was a distinction between the company and the individual. In, I think, Clause 4, there is a distinction between the penalty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
imposed on the individual and the penalty imposed on the company, whereas in this clause the two seem to have become concertinaed. Iam not clear whether it is proposed that both the company and the individuals will be liable to the aggregate fine. Will the Minister explain why there appears to be this difference?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"every officer or agent of a company".</p></blockquote>
Presumably a number of individuals will be overseas and outside the jurisdiction. I am not clear whether it is intended to cover those individuals as well, and precisely what is the position about the fines. Is the proposal to wait till the individual materialises on business in this country before seeking to catch him, or what procedure do the Government have in mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are complex matters, but we should sort them out, otherwise we may find that we are passing legislation which has very perverse effects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) appreciates, Iam sure, that central management has responsibility for ensuring that the company complies with the laws of the countries in which it trades. That is a heavy responsibility. There may be a failure by the company, but not by the responsible officer in the United Kingdom. That is the position, which, perhaps, 1did not make sufficiently clear, and which, perhaps, the clause does not make sufficiently clear. There may be cases—unlikely but possible—where both the company and the officers are not guilty, or there may be cases where both are found to be responsible. Ihope that explanation helps to clear up some of the hon. Gentleman's misgivings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked a relevant question about the responsible officer being outside the jurisdiction. It is true that proceedings may be instituted against any officer or agent, but it will only be practicable to proceed against a person who is here. t will not be possible in practice to proceed against a person who is outside the jurisdiction. Under the 1948 Act an overseas company in a place of business here has to inform the Registrar, who will accept service on behalf of the company. In practice it will only be possible to apply the clause to someone who is within the jurisdiction.
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman raised any other points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, there were some other points, and Iam getting worried at the constant flow of information back and forth from the box. Perhaps it would be better if, having made our speeches, we adjourned for half an hour to wait for the answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it in this clause—as against Clause 4 which sets out separate penalties for the company and individuals—the two appear to be concertinaed? We have had no explanation of that from the Minister. Clause 4 is concerned with the penalties for a United Kingdom company and specifically sets out what happens to the company and subsequently what happens to the individual. In Clause 11the two are concertinaed and the company and the individual are separately liable for the aggregate fine of£400 and£40 for each day after the end of the period. The Minister gave no explanation of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised by the Minister's reference to all officers of the company. It is not satisfactory for us to be asked to pass a clause which provides that every officer or agent of the company is liable even though he is outside the jurisdiction. The Minister said that nothing would be done about that, but is it really so? Is it not possible to proceed against the individual if he has property in the United Kingdom? The more I look at the clause and consider the Minister's reply the more Iam worried that the clause has not been properly drafted and that we should probe it further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:The Minister, if Iunderstood him aright, said that those who drafted the clause envisaged a situation in which there was a failure by the company but not by the responsible officer in the United Kingdom. It follows that the Minister must envisage a failure by a responsible officer or agent who is without the United Kingdom. The clause imposes a personal fine against the officer or agent in those circumstances, but it is a mistake to prescribe a penalty when it is doubtful whether it will be possible to collect it. t is inherently wrong to attach a penalty to the individual officers or agents of the company, who may be in the Yemen, Uganda, or a remote part of Patagonia, unless the Department has in mind how those penalties can be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
enforced. The purpose of the clause is to make individual officers below board level responsible for seeing that the accounts from the overseas trading companies are in, filed and available within the prescribed time. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) said, this proposal throws up considerable difficulties. There is no point in trying to attach penalties on individuals unless the Minister knows how he will collect them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) did not like the flow of notes. I thought I had made clear why British companies and overseas companies were treated differently in respect of the criminal penalties for failure to file accounts. The duty of a British company to prepare and file accounts is placed on the directors, but, as the directors of an overseas company may be overseas and hence outside British jurisdiction, that duty is placed on the company precisely because the directors of overseas companies may be outside the jurisdiction. The directors of British companies will be liable if accounts are not filed, but the overseas company and every officer or agent who knowingly and wilfully allows a default will be liable. I thought that I had made that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both hon. Gentlemen asked why a penalty should be provided for someone who may be outside the jurisdiction when in practice it may not be possible to enforce it. There will usually be a responsible officer in this country and it would be wrong to excuse him merely because we cannot catch other officers who are outside the jurisdiction. Under the present law, overseas companies and every officer and agent are liable for penalties to file accounts under Section 410, so this is not an innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have helped to clear up some of the misgivings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making some progress but it is still far from clear. The Minister is saying in this clause that the penalty is on the company and "every officer or agent" rather than on the directors because they may be out of the jurisdiction. t may be that every officer or agent is out of the jurisdiction. It is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
clear why the clause is drafted in this way, because under this arrangement an officer or agent outside the jurisdiction will be liable if he arrives in the United Kingdom on business, whereas a director will not. It is the word "every" which is worrying me. The question is whether it should be the company, or the officers or agents in the United Kingdom. The Minister has still not answered why in Clause 4 the penalties are split as between companies and directors, whereas in this clause the penalty apparently is precisely the same for the company and the individual. That seems to be an oddity to which I have so far been unable to detect the answer in the Minister's replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have made some progress. That is an advance on the hon. Member's previous position. I must remind him of the words "knowingly and wilfully". To establish a default of an officer, agent, or company it is necessary to establish that an officer or agent "knowingly or wilfully" allowed a default. That is a considerable burden on the prosecution. No officer or agent need feel that he can be capriciously found guilty of default in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought I had dealt with the other points fully. There is a difference between the treatment of British and overseas companies and I thought I gave the reasons fairly fully. I do not think much good would be done by expanding further or going over the same ground, if the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is not with me. If he is worried about a particular word in the drafting, of course, I will look at it. It does not seem to me that he need have any fear, or that there is an anomaly, because I have explained in detail why overseas companies are treated in this clause differently from British companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not happy that the Government have given sufficient attention to this, but the best thing we can do is to say that they should look at it carefully in the light of our discussion and see, before Report, whether clarification is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This and the string of amendments with it cover a variety of worries about Clause 12(1). This is an introductory subsection to the clause "Accounting records". I would never have chosen the title "Ac- counting records" because it brings a great danger of being forced to look at accounting documents from a historical point of view rather than as the essential road for the day-to-day continuation of the activities of that company. From that point of view subsection (1) is defi- cient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important aspects of accounting records is that they should facilitate all those in control of a company in making sure that that company is on the road or on the rails on a day-to-day basis, so that they can see the way ahead as they go. It is not a matter of looking back after the event and seeing where they went off the track or drove straight into the wall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a time of difficulty with liquidity for many companies—and this is applicable to small as to large companies—the need for a company is to keep an eye on its ability to pay its debts from day to day, and the need is paramount. That aspect is not sufficiently underlined in the words in subsection (1), and for that reason I propose Amendment No. 27, which underlines the need for the directors of a company to be informed, as time goes on, of the financial position of that com- pany and of its ability to pay its debts as they fall due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also gives a future dimension, so that at any point of time a company is in a continuum, and should know what has been happening up to that point and what is likely to happen as a conse- quence of actions taken. This is impor- tant in the effective management of a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The larger companies, with more sophisticated data techniques at their disposal, will look after this aspect from the point of view of building up company models which give them an ongoing picture of development. However, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
does not mean that this possibility is not open to small companies as well. Most will have accounting techniques to ensure that directors are aware of how the company is proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have tabled Amendment No. 28 which appears to recognise some of the weaknesses in the Bill, but I regret that in that amendment there has not been sufficient underlining of the ability to pay debts. t is important to build that into the Bill so that all those with responsibilities for the course a company takes are aware of the need to keep that in mind at all times. The Govern-ment amendment is a step forward com-pared with the original drafting of the Bill, but is an insufficient step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Party has also tabled an amendment, No. 81, which appears to try to make the same points about ability to pay debts, but it leaves out
	<br><blockquote><p>"a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs and to show and to explain its transactions".</p></blockquote>
There may be good reason for that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is just a question of elegance in drafting. The clause with the amendment go on to cover those points, which we think matter. The amendment looks rather odd. It is excessive architectural elegance in drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I read it too quickly. I see now that that amendment and my amendment are virtually identical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other amendments with Amendment 27 and some of them go considerably further. Amendment No. 29, about which, no doubt, the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will speak, appears to have a printing error, with the word "company" instead of "Company's". That underlines the financial aspect of Amendment No. 27 which would presumably cover it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 takes the question considerably further. It takes a "major" company as an entity and thereafter an amendment defines a "major" company. There are considerable merits in Amendment No. 97 in that it is looking at future profitability, which is the whole reason for an ongoing policy of monitoring company performance. I do not know whether No. 97 and those with it are a little ambitious in this context, given the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
limitations of this Bill, but I have a great deal of sympathy with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I would stress the need for directors of companies not to have any temptation to continue trading in disregard of a company's possible insolvency, and the need for this to be underlined at every opportunity. There is an opportunity here at the beginning of Clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment there is a series, some in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), and no doubt he will expand on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the arguments of the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) whose amendment, while marginally lengthier than ours, as he rightly says, is fundamentally the same. The same fundamental point is that those engaged in running a company should be aware whether they are solvent or not. This is the theme of all this legislation and of much of other Bills being discussed at the present time, including the Insolvency Bill. An amendment of this kind would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have put down Amendment No. 28 but they do not seem to concentrate on this aspect of the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt, when he comes to reply, the Under-Secretary could tell us how he sees the relationship between the two and whether he accepts the point we are making and whether we should seek to integrate both in the Bill now or later. Obviously, the Under-Secretary had some doubts about the original drafting, because he has tabled his amendment. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Member for Kensington on his wide range of amendments, and the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Brandon Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have been kind to me, Mr. Crawshaw, in your selection. Not all my amendments are shots down the same barrel, and I do not think I should try to cover all of them in a single introductory speech. I hope that it may be possible to explain the reasoning behind Amendments No. 29 and 30 as the debate develops. But I believe the whole group of amendments worthy of consideration in their own right. We were interested when the Minister tabled Amendment No. 28. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
ask ourselves whether this is a departmental move in the right direction or an acceptance of the points of the argument being waged inside and outside the House. I am proposing these amendments in order to draw attention to the whole function of auditing and to expand and broaden the nature of the audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the Minister's amendment—no doubt we shall be hearing from him directly—I ask myself three principal questions. Who will decide what data are needed? Who will have the information? And who will have the duty to act on it? I mentioned briefly in an earlier meeting the disclosure requirements in the 1967 Act. The production of data and estimates is something to which this Committee needs to give attention. We need to consider the whole question of disclosure. In my opinion the 1967 Act went too far in some of its provisions on disclosure, yet it did not go far enough, because obviously it has not remedied the sickness of many joint stock companies. Disclosure of the sort laid down in the 1967 Act is unlikely to show the whole of the strengths and weaknesses of the company to an outsider. If data are disclosed statutorily it may give rise to suspicion among outsiders, whether justified or unjustified, but it is unlikely to result in a cure being effected to the companies' problems or in the application of the right remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the thousands of companies which are having to comply every year with the 1967 Act no one really takes the trouble to analyse the figures at all. I suspect, therefore, that either nothing or too little will happen as a result of data being produced and made generally known. On the other hand, too much may happen. People may see that the relationships between the various elements in the published accounts are coming adrift and they may suspect that the situation in the company is far worse than it is. They may then try a curative campaign from outside which may be far too drastic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point of my amendments is to show that we need more data and that we have to ensure that they are used in the right way. First, what data do we need? Until now British company legislation has focused! on the historic data, the profit and loss account and the balance sheet seen in retrospect, but we must have current
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
information as to where a company stands from month to month or even from day to day in many businesses. When I say we must have it, that is a mistake. The point of Amendment 97 is that the company itself needs this information. in the vast majority of cases the company produces, or secks to produce, the current information needed for management, though often in an unambitious or unprofessional way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of thinking has gone on in recent years, particularly with the advent of machinery which is able to handle large volumes of data extremely rapidly, about the ways in which a company's internal accounting procedures could be improved. What I am seeking to do in my various proposals for company law reform is to hasten the process where the less efficient companies catch up with the practice that has become normal standard routine in the best. Concerning internal data and reporting, there are sensationally wide gaps between the best current practice and that carried out in problem companies. I emphasise the need for current information about what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need to see what the estimates are of the future course of the business. Management ought to focus on the future and make the best estimates it can of the future course of the business as a regular and competent routine. Once again, it is extremely difficult to lay down how this procedure is to be carried out because no two companies are quite the same. I am sure, from my own limited personal experience, and from the advice I have had from people engaged in many different kinds of business undertakings, that if one concentrates upon the problems of making accurate estimates and draws together all the resources of knowledge there are within a joint stock company, it is by no means necessary to regard the preparation of estimates as pure guesswork. We can develop routines of estimation which are far more accurate than just mere hunch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need not only current data but future estimates for planning investments. So much of the investment in British industry since the war has been ill planned because companies were not able to take an accurate view of what their markets might be in five or 10 or 20 years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need a clear idea of where the management believes the company is going
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
because it gives a sense of participation to all the senior officials and to the work force. That is all-important for morale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another point I would like to make without wishing to emphasise it too much. To analyse the variances from estimates as time goes by is a valuable discipline in itself. Much can be learnt from comparing the outturns in practice from the estimates made in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second major question is, who do we get to specify what data are to be produced? This is one of the questions that I put to the Minister at the start of my remarks this morning. We have to recognise that no two companies are exactly the same: we must accept that it is futile to decide by statute what current data and future estimates are to be produced. Since every business has its own slightly different problems, each management must decide to tackle its problems in the way which is appropriate to its own business. Neither the Department nor politicians can dictate to management precisely what is the best way of dealing with the production of data and estimates. Therefore, we have to find someone who will lay down in each business what data and estimates are to be prepared. This takes a good deal of consideration. In my amendment No. 97 I have come to a conclusion and the more I think about it the more certain I am that it is the right one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ask a ridiculous question, which answers itself at once, should it be the responsibility of the shareholders to direct what data management should produce and what quality of estimates to make? That is ridiculous to anyone who is familiar with the way joint stock companies operate; the shareholders cannot possibly dictate to management on such matters of detail. Should it be made the responsibility of the board as a whole? There is something to be said for that. The management of the company ultimately rests with the board. However, in many companies the board consists of senior executives who are really heads of departments; there are commercial representatives, representatives of production, accountancy and research. These men know their own area of business, but all too often do not take a synoptic view, and I do not think that any one of the executives who specialises in a particular aspect of the business is necessarily the right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
person to decide the way in which data and estimates are to be produced. This is why I would rule out the chief accountant or the financial director or their equivalent, by whatever name, in each business. He may come near to it, but he perhaps does not have the professional expertise which the job requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the auditors. It seems to me that the auditors have the knowledge and the professional capacity and are the right people to decide what has to be done in preparing current data and future estimates. I have come to rest with the auditors for a number of reasons. Perhaps most of all because I want the practice of auditing to expand and to be lifted off the shoals of retrospective production of data on which auditing unfortunately has come to rest and where it is stranded at present. I would like to see professional accountancy developing its skills more and more in relation to the present and future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the responsibility of deciding about a firm's data processing and estimation programme give special problems to the auditors? It might make the function difficult to perform effectively if we sought to apply it universally from the start. While I realise that there may be small firms of auditors who have not thought in this way and will take some time to get round to doing it, I would point out to the Committee that my amendment refers only to major public companies as defined in Amendment No. 97 read with my Amendment No. 72. I believe that this would catch only some 500 or 1,000 of our largest business. Such business will inevitably be employing large firms of auditors, and most large firms of auditors already offer management accounting and data processing expertise as an additional service to their clients. Therefore to ask them to go straight into gear to provide this function automatically is not, in my opinion, asking too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a philosophical question which deserves analysis. It arises just as much in relation to the Minister's Amendment No. 28 as in the other amendments being debated with it. We are standing here on the frontier between past and future, and retrospective data on the one hand, and current and future data on the other, have to be seen as having a quite different quality from each other. Historic details are fact—or they should be. My amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
ments No. 29 and No. 30 are an attempt to lay emphasis on the fact that balance sheet and profit and loss accounts are merely concerned with financial data and not with general considerations of company quality and performance. In looking backwards we are supposedly dealing with ascertainable facts. Unfortunately, in the investigations which have taken place into recent company scandals it has become obvious that different, highly professional and experienced, expert auditors can take different views of the same set of figures and put different emphasis, or interpretations, on what might have been thought to be indisputable fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in looking backwards an element of judgment has to be brought in, but when we start to look at information arising from the current activities of the company we have to acknowledge that it may have a provisional quality or may be only half true. As a business develops, new factors may creep in which were not envisaged when the plan for collecting data and analysing the data was laid down. Thus immediately we find ourselves in an area where judgment and information have increasingly to come in and scientific and professional routine may be at a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the future, when we have to prepare estimates and projections of a business, then judgment is more or less everything and calculation has to take second place. Even there it is not necessary as I tried to say just now, to depend on pure guesswork. There are ways of making predictions of the future course of a business which can be followed as a professional routine. But in making longterm estimates we are inevitably verging on guesswork and sometimes on sheer fantasy; so this is a difficult area in which to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a. m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless we cannot leave the problem unsolved even for another year, or a period of years, while the Department remains in its ivory tower. Who is to use, and draw conclusions from, the data and estimates that are produced? That question is signally unanswered in the Minister's version of the clause that we are discussing. To call on companies to produce data and estimates which are not studied by anybody, or not by any responsible person within or outside the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
company, is a futile exercise. To require the production of data without seeing that they are put to good use is the kind of practice that gets company law a bad name. We must solve the problem of who is to use and draw conclusions from the data and estimates which the companies produce. We cannot hand that problem to outsiders, whether shareholders, selected outsiders or institutional investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must prevent disclosure, for an important reason. People buying and selling securities attempt all the time to obtain information ahead of the market. It is proper for them to do so, within reason, but we must not provide facilities whereby unfair advantages might be obtained by certain groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relevant to read from a letter which I received a few weeks ago from one of the senior managers of a large unit trust group. I shall not disclose its name. However, if the Minister asks me to show him the letter I shall be happy to do so. I am changing the text of the letter slightly as I do not want it to become obvious who wrote it. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In your letter is the most serious point of all. This is your paragraph that institutional investors are turning themselves into a privileged class of investor. I am terrified about this and think that it is wholly undesirable. Unfortunately, I could not put in writing some of the difficulties that we have got into in this office by knowing far too much about companies. The trouble is that one cannot publish these matters because we are given confidences that we should not have, but I find that I am being increasingly consulted by chairmen of companies for one's help and advice, and these are, of course, companies in which we are heavily invested. I work hard to keep information in my mind in separate compartments and information controlled inside this office, but it is not easy."</p></blockquote>
I read that letter as I wanted to warn the Minister that in Amendment No. 28 he is treading on dangerous ground. I am well aware that I am also treading on dangerous ground in my Amendment No. 97. It is important that we should ensure that we do not have partial disclosure to certain people or partial disclosure of misleading aspects of the data and estimates which are produced within the company and which might be made use of in the wrong way. The last thing we want is that private shareholders should find out what is happening to their companies after the market has moved
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
because some other types of investors have been able to obtain information in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise, we must require companies to produce current data and estimates. We need to depend on the auditors to decide what each company should do. When the figures are produced, they must be properly and thoroughly assessed by the directors, but not disclosed to outsiders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we ensure that the figures are considered and acted. upon? Should they rest in the in-trays of the management or enter into policy making? Someone must have the duty and the power to act in an effective supervisory capacity on the basis of the data produced by the company. Who should that be? In this Bill we now fall short of setting up an audit committee, as I suggested earlier. If we are not to set up an audit committee, possibly we should turn to the non-executive directors, but as we have seen all too painfully in the Lonrho disclosures, the non-executive directors, under the present state of British company law, are in a hopeless position if they try to exercise their judgment against that of the executives on the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not in favour of giving more power to the supervisory elements in the company, he must answer this question: how is Clause 28, or any variant of it which the Committee may adopt, to be made an effective development of company law? This is not a matter for Bullock. The Minister must not shelter behind that excuse any more. The Minister must here and now tell the Committee what his thinking is. The Department must give a lead, or we shall make no serious progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always find my hon. Friend's ideas about the reform of company law interesting and stimulating. I agree with many of his ideas. However, I am afraid that I must disagree with him about Amendment No. 97. I hope to explain why I think that the amendment is misguided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend grossly exaggerated the idea of the capability of the auditor and his role. He said that even dealing with the past, when the facts and figures are known, may be difficult; it is difficult to put a value on work in progress or development expenditure, or to assess the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
possible contingent liabilities. The auditor, in dealing with the past year's accounts, must pass judgment on certain assets which are in the company's hands. That is a difficult job, but for the auditor then to dabble in future projections and to produce figures on which the company is supposed to rely, seems to me to be grossly overestimating the capacity of even the better auditing firms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few months ago I chided one of my hon. Friends for not having read the text of my amendment. Although it is always possible to improve any text, however much work has already been done on it, nevertheless I have tried with these amendments to envisage the way in which they might be interpreted and to make my meaning plain. I say in Amendment No. 97 that the company must produce certain information which, in the opinion of the auditors, is required. I do not ask the auditors to produce the information. I merely ask them to lay down what the company must produce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My hon. Friend made his point. However, I do not think that it is a point of any consequence to my argument. I say that it would be a gross waste of management accounting talent if it were employed in exercises of this kind. If there are people with this kind of ability available, they are better employed working in the day-to-day management of companies. We totally misunderstand the way in which the auditor is able to work if we think that he is capable of carrying out this job. I refer to the person working in the company on a day-to-day basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the companies to which my hon. Friend refers there are accounting divisions, which produce the projections of cash flows and budget, and which monitor performance on a continuous basis. That is an essential part of running a business of any size. There is no company that my hon. Friend could name, of the size that he is trying to catch with this amendment, which is not already doing that. The decision whether the business will be profitable and pay its debts—this constant monitoring—is a major function of the internal accountant. That is already happening in the sizeable companies to which my hon. Friend referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
This is where my hon. Friend must reduce the matter to one of personalities. Accountants have ever-changing staffs. My firm employs nearly 200 such people. People qualify; they leave; there is a tremendous turnover. I have known of cases, time after time, where firms resented the fact that a brash, newly-qualified man was sent to carry out an audit. He plays around on the fringes of what the company does. He has not had the experience of becoming involved in the detail that the management accountant has at his finger tips. The auditor comes for two or three weeks and examines in some detail what is presented to him. He asks many semi-naive questions. Next year someone else comes along. Again the educational process by the internal accountant starts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember when I worked in the Metal Box Company. I went to a large factory in Neath. A group of cocky people were wandering around the place. I asked who they were. I was told "They are the auditors. They are a damned nuisance. They get in everybody's way and stop us running our business. They take up the time of the management who are running the show". If my hon. Friend had his way these people would not come along merely to process last year's figures. They would pass judgment on the data and the views put before them by the management accountants. A brash young accountant might say "I am not sure that you are right in thinking that this year the company will make a profit of£x".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say this to my hon. Friend. In the world as it is there simply are not enough people available—certainly not in firms of auditors—who are capable of making those types of judgments. The people who are good at making such judgments are not interested in being auditors. They are highly priced and paid. They work in industry, monitoring the day-to-day workings of the businesses which are fortunate enough to find them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that the problem was that when we had assembled the information wemust protect it and make sure that it did not get into the wrong hands. For instance, Price Waterhouse may have given its blessing to an assessment, or might have made its own assessment, of the future profitability of a company and the likelihood that it would be able to pay its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
debts. If it was wrong, people would say "How dare Price Waterhouse become involved in this! It was wrong again". Price Waterhouse would say "We were only paid to send a man there for a month. He did his best. We used the data that were available. I am sorry that we made a mistake".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those firms are entering fields for which they are not qualified. The people who work for them may not wish to work in those areas. I should hate it if the best brains in British management accounting were diver- ted into that kind of exercise. I am sorry to speak in a slightly less than laudatory way about my own profession. I think that my hon. Friend grossly over-estimates its capacity to carry out the job that he wants it to do. The auditor has a difficult enough task looking at the so-called facts about the previous year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether the company will be able to pay its debts and be profit- able is the company's concern. There is no sense in ignoring the fact that the company will seek to achieve both those objects. The company is doing so regularly on a day-to- day basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see the point of my hon. Friend's amendment. I do not think that the auditing profession is geared to doing the job that he thinks it should do. I do not think that the talents which it would need to acquire should be diverted into that task.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I advert initially to two of the Government amend- ments and then to the contributions made by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) and the hon. Member for Kensing- ton (Sir B. Rhys Williams). I shall also pray in aid the remarks in that respect from the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It intrigues me that, if the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South ever became Prime Minister, an hon. Member might be prompted to ask him whether he would pay an official visit to Neath. He would be able to say "I have already done so".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that attention should be drawn to the variety of points made. Even if I do not agree with the practicability of some of the proposals, it is right, particularly regarding the remarks of the hon. Member for Caernarvon, that attention should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
drawn to these issues. I hope I shall convince him that the solution he has postulated has practical difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I shall convince the Committee that the remedy we are seeking in Amendments 28 and 36 is the most practical solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments, in my name, recast the general requirements as to accounting records in consequence of points raised in another place; we also engaged in detailed consultation with the accountancy profession and others about this Bill. I hope these amendments reflect the results of those discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsections (1A) and (1B) extend and amend the general requirements in subsection (1) in two principal regards. First they make it an express requirement that accounting records should always be kept up to date by requiring that they shall be such as to
	<br><blockquote><p>"disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the company at that time."</p></blockquote>
It was implicit in the clause as originally drawn that accounting records should be kept up to date, but having regard to the importance of this point the Government felt this should be explicitly spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment includes a new requirement that the accounting records should be such as to enable the directors to prepare accounts complying with the requirements of the Companies' Acts and which give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs. This requirement, with the provision that the accounting records shall disclose the financial position of the company at any time, replaces the provision, in the clause as drafted originally, that the records shall be sufficient to give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs. It was represented to us that in practice it was not possible for a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs to be obtained from the raw data of the accounting records, and that such a view could only be obtained from the accounts drawn up on the basis of the record which assembles all the relevant material. We accept the force of that argument, and in those circumstances we propose the clause be redrafted. I hope, so far as the Opposition are concerned, that this will at least gain the support of the hon. Member for Hertfordshire South who has, I would

	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
have thought, more practical expertise in this field than any other Member of the Committee, I hope flattery will get me somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to subsection (6)(b) is simply consequential and brings the part of that subsection dealing with accounting records not kept in Great Britain into line with the amended subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments in no way constitute any relaxation in the requirements as to the keeping of accounting records, and, indeed, make these requirements more realistic and explicit and make it more clear what it is that the companies are expected to comply with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the words "with reasonable accuracy" which appear in paragraph (a) of new subsection (1B) requires some attention. It is important that the accounting records should be reliable, but it would not be realistic to suggest that they could be 100 per cent. accurate at all times. What is needed is that the directors and other officers of the companies should be in a position to assess the overall position of the companies, and this requires the records to be reasonably accurate, but not necessarily 100 per cent. accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words "reasonable accuracy" could lead to all sorts of implications in people's minds and people could read into them things which the Minister does not intend. What he is saying is that accounting records should have absolute accuracy but that at any one point in time they may not have caught up with eventualities as they are happening, but that is not entirely what may be read into these words. Perhaps he ought to look at them again before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will look at the matter. The difficulty is that the term "absolute" represents "100 per cent". There is a difficulty about seeking to create that situation. It is impracticable. I do not rule anything out. My aim is to try to improve the Bill, not exactly perhaps along the lines suggested by the hon. Member for Kensington, South. If the hon. Gentleman feels there is some difficulty, which there is in defining the term "reasonable" in this context, we should look at it, but it will be difficult as a matter of practice to do better than that. One will have to take into account the possibility of trivial
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
error. If there were a trivial error, and a duty imposed of 100 per cent. accuracy, and if that error were of little significance, it would be wrong for the officers of the company to be held guilty of criminal offences in those circumstances. That highlights one of the problems which would arise in taking the course suggested by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister please fill out that point with regard to offences? I did not take exactly what he meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that if there is a duty imposed, and supported by a criminal sanction, to obtain records with absolute accuracy, even a trivial error could, nevertheless, import criminal liability, which would be unreasonable in all the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been somewhat sparing in my comments in the last three sittings but I hope I might make a point on the question of "reasonable". Surely the reason why "reasonable" occurs so often in statutes is that it allows interpretation to take account of all the circumstances and not lead to the kind of categoric assertions that the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) would wish to see. It is in itself reasonable to put it in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support so sparingly but usefully given by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the proceedings, but I am still worried about what the Minister said about criminal sanctions in relation to the amendment of the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley). Clearly, if one inserted "reasonable" it might soften it. There is, anyway, a certain amount of play in the steering of his amendment, which is concerned with seeking to get a true and fair view of the accounts. I am not clear what is so precise in the amendment that the problem of criminal sanctions arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a duty under the clause dealing with accounting records. A person guilty of an offence under the clause becomes liable to prosecution and conviction and, on conviction, to certain penalties. I am saying that, having regard to the nature of what the hon. Member for Caernarvon said, he was imposing too heavy a burden and one that in all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
circumstances would be likely to be impracticable. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Havering—Romford (Mr. Neubert)—it must be a Havering constituency—that there ought to be a measure of flexibility here, not only from the point of view of the court but as to whether a prosecution ought in certain circumstances to be brought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister go further and agree that in current statutes absolute accuracy is not required? What is required is that directors or auditors should, to the best of their knowledge, confirm that the accounts are accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know not what today is coming to. That I should receive such support from the hon. Gentleman in the space of one minute is remarkable. I welcome it. I hope it will go on throughout the course of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot promise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister is about to leave this point and I do not want him to get away with it quite so easily. If criminal or any other court proceedings are being contemplated against a company the question in the minds of those considering the matter would be whether there is a system of accounting records that can facilitate this information being available. If that system does not exist and no effort has been made to make this information available there would certainly be a need for proceedings against that sort of company. If, on the other hand, accounting records are in existence to provide this sort of information and there was a trivial slip, this is not a matter for prosecution. I am certain that those required with this duty would have the good sense to follow that sort of judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would still impose most important duties of absolute duty. Even if the hon. Gentleman were right in saying, as he would ultimately, that it is unlikely that a sentence would be imposed, if he asserts that there should be an absolute duty here, an offence would be committed even if the matter were trivial. If the matter came before the court a conviction would have to follow, even though it might result in an absolute discharge. This is not a system where we want to impose that degree of flexibility and rigidity. I would
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for Upminster—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neubert</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Romford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is most uncivil of me. Having got the hon. Member's support I have got his constituency wrong. I would support his remarks that the present system enables us to have some flexibility in the assessment of the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Amendment No. 27 and the contribution made by the hon. Member for Caernarvon. Government Amendment No. 28 meets all but one of the points sought to be made by the hon. Gentleman. The one we are not able to meet is that accounting records should be such as to enable the directors to inform themselves of the company's ability to pay its debts. We do not think that that is a practical requirement, desirable though it may sound, especially having regard to the eloquent contribution made by the hon. Gentleman. It is right that the directors of a company should know whether it will be able to pay its debts as the debts fall due. That is good commercial management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt, too, the directors will have regard to the duties imposed under Section 332 of the 1948 Act in relation to fraudulent trading. The hon. Gentleman did not deal with that. is it something that can be deduced solely from the accounting records? The inference he drew, was that the accounting records should reveal the lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the accounting records can and should show what debts the company has to pay, when they may be paid, what payments are owed to the company, and when they may be received. Whether or not the company is in a position to meet its debts will necessarily depend on a variety of different factors. t will depend, for example, on the company's ability to raise more money, but that does not appear in the company's accounts. It will depend on the company's ability to increase an overdraft, but that does not appear in the accounts. It will depend on the company's ability to retain or extend existing loan facilities, but that does not appear in the accounts. It may, perhaps, depend on the potential default of a major debtor. That can have a material effect on a company, and it will not necessarily appear in the company's accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
The hon. Gentleman's proposition has the serious defect that the whole position would not be revealed from the accounts. No doubt when he replies he will seize upon that point. If he can establish that I am wrong about that, I shall listen with care to what he has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Iam coming to the hon. Member in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that Amendment No. 28 overcomes the objections which he is making to Amendment No. 27?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Ithink that my amendment does overcome the objections. It deals with the points which I have just raised. It deals with the question of disclosing with reasonable accuracy and giving a true and fair view of the company's state of affairs. It is right to impose those duties, but not to go far beyond that in the way the hon. Member for Caernarvon indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt at this point? t is more convenient to do so, given that there are two separate debates going on at the same time. On the question whether the company has the ability to pay its debts, it is true, as the Minister said, that the company may require to take into account other information which is not in the accounts—for example, its ability to borrow. That is no reason for excluding from the requirements all the ordinary data necessary for the assessment. Amendment No. 27 does not say that every company shall keep accounts in such a manner as to enable the directors to inform themselves of the financial position without taking any other factors into account. t just suggests that the accounts should be sufficient to ensure that objective. It is essential that companies do not go on trading if they are insolvent. The accounts should provide all the necessary information, and we are far from clear that that is so under the Minister's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter on which I have not convinced the hon. Gentleman, which is a pity. I always like to convince him because we make greater progress when I do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the hon. Gentleman is right in what he says about the drafting of Amendment No. 27. The two duties are
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
clearly conjunctive. The amendment refers to the company's ability
	<br><blockquote><p>"to pay its debts as and when they fall due."</p></blockquote>
t is plain what is expected, and I do not think that the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is right. It may not be what the hon. Member for Caernarvon intended and he may wish to put the drafting right later. Clearly, there is a difference of view between the hon. Members for Worthing and Caernarvon in that regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggests that there is a difference of view, but I do not agree. There is no difference of view, in that the amendment does not say that the accounting records exclusively shall be the basis on which such judgment should be taken. On the question of raising new capital or extending overdraft facilities, the accounting record system should focus on the need for action in this direction so as to ensure that the directors take that action when necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman is not right about that. There may be a drafting defect which he may wish to cure. The amendment states specifically that the accounting record shall be kept in such manner as to enable the directors to inform themselves at any time of the company's financial position and of its ability to pay its debts. There is a clear duty there which is not qualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is it qualified? t is not qualified. The question whether a company is able to pay its debts can be determined by many factors which are extraneous to the accounts. I am positive in my mind that that is not dealt with satisfactorily, if that is the hon. Gentleman's intention in the amendment. This concept is not one which the Committee should accept. We may not, however, succeed in convincing one another on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the speech made by the hon. Member for Kensington. His Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 seek to ensure that subsection (1) is concerned only with the company's financial affairs and transactions. Government Amendment No. 28 makes that explicit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main burden of the hon. Gentleman's speech related to Amendments No. 97 and 98. On previous occasions the hon. Gentleman has argued that the scope of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
audit should be extended so as to cover not simply the record of past transactions but the future. The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South dealt fairly formidably with the contentions advanced by the hon. Member for Kensington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kensington carries with him no support from the professional bodies, certainly not from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. One comment I wish to make relates equally to Amendment No. 27 but is, perhaps, more pointed to the amendments of the hon. Member for Kensington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for having to leave the Committee for about 10minutes to attend another meeting down the Corridor. Ihope that he will not feel inhibited in referring to me. I hope I shall be back in time to listen to my hon. Friend's criticism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ifthere is a Division within 10 minutes Ihope that the hon. Gentleman will hear it being called—but perhaps I am being too optimistic about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question postulated by the hon. Member for Kensington reflects on the ability to pay debts. The ability to pay debts when they fall due requires a forecast to be made of the future course of events, among other things, in relation to trading profits. As proposed, those estimates would form part of the accounting records and come under the scrutiny of the auditors, as is required by Section 14 of the 1967 Act. Are auditors willing and competent to examine forecasts of profitability? The Institute of Chartered Accountants issued a guidance note to its members in which it stated categorically that profit forecasts were not capable of confirmation and verification in the same way as financial statements, and the note went on to say that they were not capable of being audited. That is the view of a reputable professional body which, I am sure, has given careful consideration to these points. That view is underlined by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South, who has been a practising accountant. If the professional body does not have the willingness or competence to deal with this issue, how practical can the proposal be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, as the Government would have it amended would ensure that companies are required to keep proper
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
accounting records enabling the directors to assess the companies' financial position at any time. The Bill already requires companies to keep records which provide the essential data on which to assess future prospects. I have already referred to the effect of Section 14 of the 1967 Act, which imposes upon auditors the duty to state in their report if proper accounting records have not been kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments go further. They impose a statutory duty to prepare, in relation to future business, estimates which would be sufficient to enable an assessment to be made of the future profitability of the company. It is desirable as a matter of good commercial judgment that directors should endeavour to look to the future, but to impose a statutory requirement along the lines suggested would be neither desirable nor practicable. Statutory requirements should be precise, capable of enforcement, and capable of understanding. A requirement on the lines proposed would be so general as to be little more than an exhortation to observe good management practise and to plan ahead. I think that the Opposition will agree that forward planning and an assessment of future profitability must be an ongoing process in a good commercial enterprise. It is not undertaken only once in each accounting period as the amendments seek to imply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that clearly predictions concerning a company's future business are difficult to make with any degree of accuracy. They can turn out to be completely wrong and very careful consideration is therefore required before we follow the course which the hon. Gentleman has sought to persuade us to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point I would make is that that amendment would also involve the auditors taking a view on the estimates necessary to predict the future profitability of the company. This is outside the functions of the auditor altogether. The auditor's job is to report on the accounts. to report on the adequacy of the accounting records, not to predict the future. That is the responsibility of those controlling the company, and if they fail in that, of course that company is likely to face real difficulty. Why seek to shift the onus on to the auditors who are unwilling, as they have indicated, and not wholly competent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
to undertake the essential management function?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope the Committee will feel that it is appropriate to reject the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Caernar-von and Kensington and to accept the amendments in my name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is so much in this subject that I think we shall have to come back to it again in a future Bill. It is not possible to take up every sentence at once in the Minister's speeches from the departmental heights in such a way as to extract all the controversy which they must inevitably give rise to. He has reminded me, unexpectedly, of a character in Wagner's "Ring" who was turned into a dragon and sat on a pile of gold, refusing to allow anyone else to have it and refusing to be woken from sleep by Siegfried. I have never seen myself in the role of Siegfried, but perhaps I should come to the next sitting of the Committee in a leopard skin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the role of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could mention another character in the "Ring", but the plot would need to be more deeply analysed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone has to carry out the role of rousing the Department to its responsibilities. I have tried and failed, and I hope that others may take up the task in due course. I shall come back—but if one judged by the results I have had in recent years I am not likely to have much success in the future. However, I shall return, and I hope that in future some progress will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to refer to this until I knew that the document was here, but the hon. Member is, no doubt, aware of a consultative document dealing with disclosure, a document which is available on request and may be helpful. If Members of the Committee who are interested seek it, I shall see that they have it. I hope that the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) will make representation to get this document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Minister is speaking of the document I saw about a fortnight ago with which I was extremely disappointed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—or another one with which I shall, no doubt, be disappointed in a fortnight's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) is not able to be here because what he said from inside the profession has disclosed an alarming state of affairs. Having been brought up to admire professional bodies in this country, particularly the auditing profession, I am horrified that he feels it incapable of rising to the needs of the moment. There are many leaders of the profession who will be horrified, too, by what he said, and who would totally disagree from their own experience and their recognition of the role which auditing has to play in the future of the joint stock company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that I have exaggerated the capability of auditors to rise, at any rate, to the challenge of solving the problems as they arise in the largest companies. I said, when introducing my amendment, that I was not trying to catch all companies simultaneously, but only the largest, who are inevitably served by large and well-established firms of auditors. I do not accept nor believe that such firms are incapable of providing guidance to management on the way that data should be collected and estimates prepared. If auditors are so blinkered and limited that they cannot perform that function they will not be able to perform their statutory function either, because, looking at the past, one has to have a way of assessing the future; elements in past data require a measure of judgment because their significance cannot otherwise be properly assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply cannot accept this lighthearted picture of the auditing profession as the incapable in pursuit of the inscrutable. That is not good enough. It is not a true picture, certainly of the accountants and auditors I have known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the requirement to present
	<br><blockquote><p>"a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs",</p></blockquote>
I have sought in Amendments 29 and 30 to add the word "financial" because it is proper to show a true and fair view of the financial state of the company's affairs, but how can one, in a balance sheet or a profit and loss account, make clear to shareholders or a board of directors—or to anybody else—that there are things which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
are not financial in character but which will affect the company's performance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience was with personnel so that the examples which leap to my mind are situations where a company is in great danger although the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts seem to be sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that the auditing job has been done badly, but if a company depends on the skills of a research director who is about to retire, or if it has rested on the personal contacts of a salesman who has grown to be respected in the whole business and is of incalculable value but is losing interest or is likely to be tempted to another firm, these are important considerations. But they cannot properly feature in the balance sheet or in the profit and loss account. Yet if one is to give a true and fair view of the company's affairs, one will have to say that its future is in danger because the managing director cannot hold the staff together or assure the sort of continuity at top level which the shareholders are entitled to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has, therefore, to leave facts and figures and enter an area where personal factors and judgments need to be taken into account. It is only fair to the auditor to put in the word "financial" to show the limited character of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the section referred to financial transactions exclusively, as he seems to be suggesting, might this not exclude transfers of assets where the consideration was nil? Would that not be an undesirable exclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have a point. Inevitably a Back Bench amendment has to draw attention to something which is broadly necessary, and if the Department accepts the validity of the argument, one has to depend upon the Department to reformulate the amendment to provide for accidental side effects. I am not saying that there may be no accidental side effects. That does not mean that the amendment is wrong, but that the Department would have consequential thinking to do if it accepted my line of argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister dwelt on the point that forecasts are not capable of being audited. However, I am not asking auditors to carry out an assessment on current data and estimates, but simply to lay down what has to be done. It does not seem to me to
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
be a statutory requirement not capable of enforcement to ask auditors to make clear the work which the company has to do. After all, the whole of company law rests on the quality of the judgment of various officers and agents who take part in the joint stock company. What I am suggesting is not a revolutionary departure but is just an aspect of company routine which deals with a slightly wider area than the usual production of the balance sheet and the financial accounts. It is not impossible of enforcement. The Minister said that the auditors' responsibility is not to predict the future; but I am not asking auditors to do that, merely to see that the management is doing it. Other speakers this morning, and the Minister himself, have said that where companies are competently run, that will happen. But it has not happened in some obvious recent cases, and inevitably some companies fall below the necessary standards. Those are the companies where statutory protection of the public and the employees—the latter have been forgotten this morning—and the shareholders, is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend turn his mind for a moment to the question of the prospectus? This point was made earlier. When a prospectus is issued, directors are required to state that they have sufficient working capital for the future running of that business. I do not think that any board of directors would normally make that statement without first having close consultation with the auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir B. Rhys Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I think he is saying that management and auditors have to work together as a team. That is so, and I have pointed to new forms of statutory provision which would ensure that auditors and top management should see eye to eye and that directors should hear precisely what the auditors feel needs attending to where the future needs of the company—including those of the employees—are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to end by asking the Minister the questions which I put at the beginning. Who will decide what data are given under his Amendment 28? Who will have the information? And who will have the duty to act upon it? Perhaps I could press the middle question particularly. Who will have the information? The Minister says that the accounting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
records will be such as to disclose the financial position with accuracy; but to whom do we intend that disclosure to be made under Amendment 28? Who is to have this information? Is it to be preserved as written in later provisions of the Bill, for six years? Is it to be made available to outsiders, or are we speaking of accounting records of a confidential character?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a specific point that I would like to ask the Minister. He does not normally answer my questions as fully as I would wish. However, I hope that on this occasion he will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a requirement for internal use. It is not intended as a matter for external disclosure at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that the role of the dragon had been handed over to the Department. I was looking at that as St. George going around slaying dragons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a valuable debate in that it has focused on matters that are very important to company law. The Government amendment has come some considerable way towards meeting the points that we are putting forward. For a few moments I shall concentrate on that area that has not been agreed by the Government. I shall do so to try to persuade the Minister that there is a need to look again between now and Report at the possibility in this direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before moving on to that I follow what the hon. Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams) said in regard to the wording chosen by the Government in Amendment No. 28, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The accounting records shall be such as to</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the company at that time".</p></blockquote>
My amendment very specifically states that the directors should have this information. They are the people who will have the legal responsibility. If we look at Section 332 and other parts of the 1948 Act we see clearly that the people with the responsibility to the company are the directors. The Government should look again at the wording of their own amendment in order to strengthen it in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the general argument developed by the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
Kensington, who was right to stress the positive side of auditing. Auditing when carried out properly is a partnership with the company. It is not just 20-year-old boys going around and adding up piles of spillages to make two and two equal four. t is the setting up of a system that will provide the management of a company with the information it needs at any point to ensure that it is complying with the statutory requirements of the law and its internal requirements for good management. We are not just talking about rows of figures, but about systems. We need to ensure that companies are setting up the required system to ensure that everybody has this information. There has been a lot of change in the way companies approach these problems in the last two decades and certainly since the 1948 Act. There is a lot of room for a company law to catch up with changes in thinking in commercial and industrial enterprises in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was horrified at the implications—perhaps they were not meant—by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) when he was talking about the role of the auditor. I have had very much more favourable experience with auditors than, it seems, he has. The auditors with whom I have dealt, as a financial controller, and in other posts in industry, have had a very positive role in that they have dug out weaknesses in the system possible to put right. They have certainly drawn the ire of people, in all parts of the company, who may not have liked auditors nosing around and digging into the system. Whenever that sort of complaint came to me I would reply very strongly "Carry on auditors. Do your job. It is of importance to me with responsibility for my own department that these things should be brought to light." Anything that can be done to strengthen this positive role of the auditors needs to be done and must be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the Government, I and other hon. Members on this side of the Committee, and possibly on the other side of the Committee, have not yet got common ground, I would underline that in the Government's own amendment one of the weaknesses they see in mine exists in theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was saying that it would not be possible for the directors to inform themselves of any financial difficulty of a company because they would not know, for instance, that a debtor would turn into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
a bad debt. How is that difficulty overcome by their amendment? Accounting records shall disclose the company's position accurately, says Government. Exactly the same weakness stands in their amendment as stands in mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am trying to do in my amendment is to put the responsibility on the directors of the company to be aware of the capability of a company to pay its debts. There may be all sorts of other questions arising, such as the bringing in of new capital, or the creation or expansion of overdraft facilities, but without having the accounting records set up in the right way as a system to meet this requirement, then all the information about other factors is useless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the Government's interpretation of words on this question. My amendment provides that the accounting records shall enable directors to inform themselves of the financial position of the company and its ability to pay debts. There may be other factors as well that come into the question; there certainly would be; but without accounting records being available and geared to this purpose, the directors would certainly not be in a position to say whether the company could pay its debts or not. Liquidity having been as it has over the past three or four years, who knows how many companies have been contravening the 1948 Act in the letter and the spirit because they have not had the necessary systems set up in order to tell them? Many companies in trouble at present could have avoided that trouble if they had had the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
t is our duty as MPs, and it is the Government's duty, to ensure they have the right system—not just pass laws such as Section 332 of the 1948 Act that says we send people to prison because they are trading while insolvent. We must also give companies the provision to prevent them getting into that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be developing our Bills in that way. Therefore, I hope that the Government will look again, between now and Report, at the whole question of building into this Bill the requirement for companies to have the facility for knowing whether they are likely to become insolvent or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister has moved a considerable way in his amendment to meeting a number of the points which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
raised. If the Minister will give some undertaking to consider between now and Report the possibility of accepting, if not the words, the spirit of my amendment, and of tightening up on the question of insolvency trading, I shall withdraw my amendment in favour of the Government's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer some of the points which have been raised, and then hopefully we can move on. Per-haps I should try to spell out specifically the answer to the point I was seeking to make in an intervention in the concluding remarks of the hon. Member for Kensing-ton (Sir B. Rhys Williams). It must be recognised that directors and several officers are given a right of access to accounting records. The clause already implies, therefore, that the data to which the hon. Gentleman was referring are primarily for that. The auditors already have a requirement to comment if proper records are not maintained. To that extent they have a positive role in determining whether there is an effective internal system for maintaining records. That, however, is quite different from asking them to prophesy future economic finan-cial prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment is con-cerned with the current financial provision as it is known at the time. The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Caer-narvon (Mr. Wigley) is like to some extent, although a lesser extent, to that proposed by the hon. Member for Kensington. It is concerned with the future. If all that he is seeking to say is that the records should include historical data necessary to form a basis for assessing future ability to pay debts, then in my submission the Government amendment achieves this. We have gone a long way to meet the points the hon. Gentleman made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider what he said in the debate before Report. I cannot give any undertakings, nor do I think the hon. Gentleman is asking me to do so, but I shall look at it—it is only right that I should do so—in relation to what is essentially a technical Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the undertaking to look at the question. I appreciate that the Minister cannot commit himself. Therefore, I reserve the right to bring further amendments, possibly on Report. It is a technical matter, a matter that cuts across party lines and is of interest to all

	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
sides in this country, to ensure that we do not encourage people to go on trading in insolvency, because that can cause no end of problems to the companies and the community at large. Anything that would tighten this would be beneficial to everyone concerned.

I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

</ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 31, in page 14, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Every company which employs more than 500 persons shall keep separate and distinct accounts for each location where it employs more than 100 persons. Separate locations shall be deemed as places at least three miles distant one from another".</p></blockquote>
This amendment goes on a bit of a tangent and perhaps I would be a little optimistic if I expected the Government to meet me on this point, whereas on the other amendments I seriously expected them to come a considerable way towards meeting me. I see this amendment as a little more radical. It is difficult to encompass it within the Bill. None the less, an opportunity should be taken for pressing the point, contained also in Amendments Nos. 34 and 35. If it cannot be taken on board on this occasion, it should be borne in mind for future Bills the Government may be considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 31 is to make sure that employees in a large company have the same facility for information as employees in smaller companies. This is vitally
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
important. I have worked in several motor car companies. They are companies that perhaps do not maintain individual profit sectors for their different locations although different products are made in different locations, although the circumstances and conditions of work may be different, and the structure of management may in itself be peculiar to a plant and different from that at other of the company's plants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost certainly every company of this sort would have the facility for turning out accounting records for each location, but companies choose, for whatever reason, not to do so. This is bad management, and I believe that it is a requirement of company law to encourage good management. It is good management to be able to identify the profit that is made by a manufacturing location. That is good management from the point of view of monitoring the performance of that plant. It is also good management to involve employees in that plant in the success or failure of their own location.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If through this Bill the Industry Bill and, no doubt, when it is introduced, the Industrial Democracy Bill, we are to enable information to be disseminated among employees, then a structure of accounting is needed to bring information as close as possible to the grass roots. Some companies have of their own volition developed this sort of accounting—profit and loss accounting, transfer pricing between different profit sectors, in order to develop good management. Unfortunately, many other companies could do this by the nature of their profits and by the nature of their plants without any difficulty at all, but they choose, for internal political reasons, not to do so. That is neither conducive to good industrial relations nor to good financial management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to Amendment No. 31, to which I hope that the Government will give a positive response, if not in terms of this Bill then in terms of the development of company law. The Government indicated that there would be further measures on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I turn to Amendments No. 34 and 35. Amendment No. 34 says, in page 15, line 16, after "company", insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those details should be kept not only in the registered office of the company but also in the company's manufacturing plants, so that information may be readily available to employees. It should not be hidden in a registered office where it is not easily available to employees on the shop floor. It should be available within each of the manufacturing plants. I feel that the Government may easily take that amendment on board as it does not cause any revolutionary problem. It should fall in the main line of Government thinking to bring information nearer and to make it more easily available to employees. Although the Government may not accept this form of words, I hope that they will bring their own form of words forward on Report so as to facilitate the availability of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3.5 says, in page 15, line 18, after "officers", insert "or employees".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause refers to "officers of the company". It says that the material should be open for inspection by officers of the company. I should have thought that the amendment would have commended itself strongly to the Government and others. The material should be available for the inspection of officers and employees of the company. That amendment should commend itself to the Government. I hope that they will make arrangements to take the idea on board, now or on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in Amendment No. 31 I am flying a bit of a kite that may give the Government problems. However, I hope that the Government will be sympathetic in the longer term.' I hope that the Government will be sympathetic in the short term and include the provisions of Amendments No. 34 and 35 in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) will not be surprised to learn that I have a considerable amount of sympathy with his speech. Ialso sympathise with the objectives of his amendments, which are designed to make more information available to em-
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
ployees and to make it more meaningfully available to them in terms of the unit in which they work. The hon. Gentleman quoted the situation where more than 100 people worked in a plant. That is a situation with which I have much sympathy. The Employment Protection Act was designed to ensure that more information would be made immediately available to employees. The Government have introduced other such statutes. However, I agree that a great deal more requires to be done. That will form part of the considerations of the Bullock Committee, which will consider the general nature of what should be disclosed to workers and especially the role of worker directors. That will be highly relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed uncertainty whether these amendments, as a matter of practicability, would achieve his goals. The first amendment would require companies with more than 500 employees to keep separate accounting records for each unit employing more than 100 persons. I agree that that may be useful for companies as a matter of internal management practice. However, Iwonder whether it should be imposed by statute. The necessity to maintain separate records for each unit might considerably increase the workload. It perhaps should be left to the company to decide to what extent it is necessary to keep separate records in the light of its own circumstances. For some units separate records might not be helpful. What value would a separate record for the head office have in relation to the totality of the company's operations? There is a consequent disadvantage. Does approaching the matter in that way confer much benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause there is a duty on companies to keep proper accounting records showing the company's transactions and enabling its overall financial position to be assessed. The company's overall financial position must be foremost in our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ido not think that the amendment is necessary. I do, not want to be absolutely categorical about this. Our thinking is not sufficiently advanced to be categorical about it. The hop. Gentleman conceded that point. I wonder how-necessary it is to keep separate records from each plant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
for the purpose which the hon. Gentleman outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirements set out in the clause are minimal. There is nothing to prevent companies from obtaining additional records which they feel are right and conducive to better industrial relations, within their own discretion, and perhaps as a result of consultation with their work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman requires a greater breakdown of a company's activities being contained in its published accounts, I largely agree with him. I do not know that I should go quite as far as he presses me. In the 1967 Act there is provision to give a breakdown of profit and turnover by each class of business. Unfortunately, although much thought was given to this at the time, and great hopes were entertained about it, it has not proved effective. Therefore we are considering that aspect in the consultative document, which was drawn up by officials and put out for discussion. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider the various options that have been put forward. Perhaps he will be able to feed back some useful information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next two amendments require employees to be given access to accounting records and would make each manufacturing plant of the company a place at which the records should be kept. Under subsection (4) it is already open to the directors to keep the accounting records at any manufacturing plant, as they are free to keep them at any place that they think fit. It may be that the hon. Member for Caernarvon is suggesting that copies of all the companies' accounting records should be required to be kept at any manufacturing plant. I do not know whether that would be entirely practicable. It would create a considerable amount of duplication of paper work. It is a matter of good management practice. If the work force feel it desirable that that should be done, no doubt the idea may be put forward in specific cases through the ordinary consultative machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that employees should have more information about the companies for which they work. There is
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
common ground between the hon. Gentleman and myself on that point. However, I am not so sure whether they should have a right to inspect the internal accounting records of the company, taking into account the issue of confidentiality. Here we are talking about the company's internal records and data. I am at one with the hon. Gentleman on the subject of the published accounts. There is no question about that, but there is a difficulty in terms of commercial confidentiality when we talk about the internal data of a company. Clearly we must give more thought to that aspect. I do not know whether it would be wise at this stage to make the amendments now, bearing in mind the points that I have made. The employee directors must have access to the accounting records and all the internal data as they are the same as the other directors. They would be entitled to the same measure of information. However, what the hon. Gentleman said gives rise to problems. I think that we must refer to them in the future. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to make a contribution to the Department's thinking in view of the consultative document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the excellent relations between the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) and the Opposition throughout out proceedings so far—and in spite of the fact that the Minister gave an excessively forthcoming reply on the points made—it seems to the Opposition that the proposals would impose an intolerable burden on a great many companies, given their economic situation. The desirability of making available the additional information, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, is highly doubtful. Therefore I am not inclined to support his amendments. No doubt, in the light of further reports, we shall return to this kind of issue, but I think it is important that we should not lend our support to the amendments at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his response—and perhaps more grateful than the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), I ant not Surprised that the Conservative Front Bench do not agree with these points, although I believe that the points interest a cross-section of Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that Amendment No. 31 should have referred to "manufactur-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0806">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
ing locations" rather than "locations" to avoid the difficulty of the head office. I disagree with the Minister on the question of the extra work that that would cause. Most of the accounting records are already kept there. The extra work would be involved in the apportionment of over- heads. Those difficulties may be overcome. The Government should look in that direction in the future to enable more meaningful information to be made avail- able within manufacturing industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 deal with the availability of information. I regret that the Government should have taken the line that they have. They fear for the confidentiality of information if internal accounting records are made available. All information should be made available unless there are good reasons to the con- trary. A manager often has at his disposal information which the person on the other side of the desk does not have. That is the wrong basis. Information should be com- monly available. It should be the task of management to interpret and analyse that information, but it should not have in- formation to which other people have no access. I hope that on Report the Govern- ment will provide a means of developing the availability of information, especially to employees, not merely to officers of the company.

However, I accept some of the criticisms that were made by the Govern- ment Front Bench about the wording of these amendments.
