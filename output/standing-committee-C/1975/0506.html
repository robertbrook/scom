	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—[4th May]—</i>No. 31, in page 12, line 37, leave out paragraph 5.—[	<i>Mr. Percival.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I had to interrupt my remarks in response to the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) last Tuesday. The points that he made were of interest, but I ought to point out what I understand to be the effect of the amendment. If I am incorrect he will he able to intervene. As I understand it, the amendment would have the effect of allowing a sheriff to disburse moneys, which under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 and the Companies Act 1948 he must retain for 14 days, if within those 14 days the relevant increased monetary limit comes into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 41 (2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 obliges a sheriff under an execution in respect of a judgment for a sum exceeding £20 to retain for 14 days the proceeds of sale of goods or money paid in order to avoid the sale. He then has to pay those moneys, less his costs, to the Official Receiver or Trustee if within the 14 days notice is received of a bankruptcy petition against the debtor on which a receiving order is made. The Official Receiver or trustee is then at liberty to retain those proceeds against the execution creditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 326 (2) of the Companies Act 1948 imposes a somewhat similar obligation on the sheriff in situations affecting companies if within the 14 days notice is received of the presentation of a petition for winding up. The liquidator in those circumstances is able to retain
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
the proceeds against the execution creditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my view that it would be inequitable for an execution creditor under a judgment for a sum of between £20 and £250 to have the benefit of the execution against the trustee or liquidator in cases where the execution sale took place or money paid to avoid such sale was received before the coming into force of the increased limit. The amendment would have retrospective effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gathered that the hon. and learned Gentleman was putting this as a probing amendment, and I hope that the explanation I have given will enable him to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there was one error there. The Minister said that the sheriff is at liberty to retain the proceeds. He is actually required to retain the proceeds. I do not want to pursue that. The hon. Gentleman has done what we asked. He has given the reason behind it, and we shall consider it in print when it appears. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the schedule, as amended, be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two general points to make. One has been referred to before, but what I want to say about it now is a follow-up and not a repetition of what has been said before. The other point is quite different. Let me take them separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our debates on what should be the threshold for a bankruptcy petition, there were numerous references to the efficacy of judgment summonses as a remedy for collecting debts. This is very relevant to the general question that arises under this schedule, because the schedule as a whole, or even the Bill as a whole, is intended to be a package. We are trying to hold a balance between remedies available to creditors and the interests of debtors and of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that great inroads had been made into the remedies available to judgment creditors, and I referred in outline to the effects of removing the remedy of an order of imprisonment for debt. In reply to what I said then, the Minister said, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
effect I can give him the reference if he wishes, but it is briefer not to do so unless somebody asks for it—that he thought that I had exaggerated that and had underestimated the importance of judgment summonses. There were thousands and thousands of them, and some county court set aside a morning once or twice a week to deal with them. It is very important to the package which of us is right on that. Therefore, I have done some research and I want to give the Committee one or two figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the figures for the last two complete years before we abolished imprisonment for debt, and I give the Committee the figures under four headings: the number of judgment summonses issued, the number heard, the number in which orders of imprisonment were made, and the number of cases in which the debtor actually went to prison. In 1969, 520,347 summonses were issued—that is, of course, an enormous number: 353,389 were heard, indicating that the mere issue of the summons was effective in one of two ways: either it produced the money or it persuaded the creditor that there was no point in continuing; 175,634 committal orders were made, and 2,364 orders were implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 173,000 cases, therefore, it is plain that the mere order for committal—which was always suspended for 10 days or so to permit a man to pay—was effective, and 2,364 went to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last year before we abolished imprisonment for debtors was 1970, but I should qualify that now because I was slightly in error when I spoke to the Committee last on this. I said that imprisonment for debt remains only for Revenue debts. It remains for Revenue debts, but I should have told the Committee that it also remains a weapon of the court in the case of unpaid maintenance and also social security debts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1970, the last full year before imprisonment for debt was abolished, 496,447 summonses were issued and 331,286 of them were heard again, the same sort of proportions. The mere issue of the summons, which was very quick, was effective. The number of orders of committal was 172,262, and the number who actually went to prison was 2,252. In 170,000 cases the mere making of an order for committal was enough to produce the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
The figures after abolition of imprisonment for debt, save in the cases I have mentioned, are quite dramatic, and I had to have them checked two or three times before I would believe them. The number of judgment summonses issued in 1972—and, remember, it was abolished in 1970—was 5,139, as against 520,496: only 5,100 were issued; 3,385 were heard, 993 orders for committal were made, and 82 went to prison. I should have said that these figures come from the civil judicial statistics which are published annually and compiled by the Lord Chancellor's Department, and therefore I take them as being wholly accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To show that that was no temporary figure that would not repeat itself, I can tell the Committee that in 1973 the number of judgment summonses issued was 5,474—again, about one in 100 for those which had been issued before—3,514 were heard, 1,353 orders for committal, 76 imprisoned. It is quite apparent from the number of orders of committal that were made that the majority, if not almost all these judgment summonses, were issued by persons who could still rely upon the order for imprisonment at the end of the day. I propose to table some Questions in the hope of having the actual figures to support that, but I think it is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took one more year, the only other one that is available. Judgment sum monses issued in 1974 were 8,549; 5,462 were heard, 1,435 orders for committal were made—again emphasising that these summonses must have been mainly in fields in which an order for committal could be made—and 121 went to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Never can there have been a set of figures which more amply demonstrates these important points. First, judgment summonses were a very effective remedy so long as the possibility of imprisonment at the end of the line existed. but that since that power has been taken away from the courts, or since it was taken away in the Administration of Justice Act 1970, that remedy has ceased to be of any practical use to anybody save the parties who can rely upon the possibility of imprisonment at the end of the reckoning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is infinitely stronger than I put it when I spoke to the Committee about it before, and on those figures one could and should put it as high as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
I hope that the Minister, now having the figures—I do not blame him for not having them before; somebody should have given them to him—may now accept the obvious conclusion to be drawn. One cannot say that solicitors did not know about these. I do not think it right to say that they did not know about administration orders either, but one simply cannot say that they did not know about these; they used half a million a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. and learned Gentleman on the research he has done, but it was a very limited sort of research because the figures themselves are not wholly revealing as to the nature of the committal orders that were made, the sorts of person who were subjected to them, and the efficacy of the remedy in reality as against in theory. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman is able to point to imprisonments on committal orders, but does he not think that it is important to analyse the sorts of order that were made, the amounts involved and their relationship to bankruptcy?—That is the real importance of the research that would have to be undertaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I think it is necessary to analyse these figures and it is a great pity that the hon. Gentleman's advisers did not get them out and analyse them before we tackled this subject. The hon. Gentleman and I have both in our speeches recognised that the availability of other remedies is a factor of great importance. We have taken different views as to the value of the judgment summons as a remedy. I expressed the view that it has diminished greatly in value since the abolition of imprisonment for debt. The learned Gentleman rather pooh-poohed that, if I may use the phrase, saying that thousands and thousands were still had recourse to. I should like to see these analysed and, as I said a moment ago, having now got these figures I propose to table certain Parliamentary. Questions in the hope of getting further answers. But I hope that instead of reacting automatically the hon. Gentleman will take a little time to consider this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good anybody saying that solicitors do not know about judgment summonses. Solicitors are entirely practical people, and especially in connection with these small sums all they want to do
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
is collect the money. Therefore, if a remedy is of any use they will use it. The remedy of the judgment summons was the one they used almost automatically in the case of a judgment for debt in the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of the matter is that for every 100 summons issued before we abolished imprisonment for debt, one is issued now. Surely, that is a most dramatic piece of information and one which certainly leads 	<i>prima facie</i> very clearly to the conclusion which I am suggesting. On analysis, it may strengthen my point even further, because, it is shown that almost all those 5,000 were issued by the Treasury or the Department of Social Security, as I think may well be the case, it will demonstrate the point even more fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making this pojnt I was seeking to draw this information to the attention of the Minister and the Committee at the first available opportunity and to put it on the record for further examination, analysis and consideration. We should be interested to hear the Minister's reactions to it now, but although we may have uncovered the fact that some statement was incorrect I hope that it will not immediately make the Department's and the Minister's hackles rise and make them feel they have to defend a certain position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister and the Department will have another look at this point because, if the figures demonstrate what I suggest they demonstrate, the Minister and Department have been proceeding on at least one false premise. If that is disclosed, I hope that they will be prepared to consider the whole argument in the light of that—the whole argument here being the question of balance. That is my first point, and I shall say no more about it at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is quite different from any that has been raised so far. We all understand the question that arises when one is talking about the threshold for a bankruptcy petition. It means quite simply that a petition for bankruptcy cannot be presented unless it can be founded on a debt of the specified sum. or unless several people together can find a sum which, in the aggregate, exceeds whatever the specified threshold is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A company in the process of winding up does not proceed in that way. We discussed one amendment on Tuesday
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
which might have led one to think that there was such a thing as a minimum debt for winding up on the grounds of insolvency which was comparable to the minimum debt for the presentation of a bankruptcy petition. There is not. So far as I know, the only context in which there is a minimum debt basis for winding up is the statutory demand. That is the clause which I think I quoted to the Committee last time; it appears in the schedule even if I did not quote it. I am informed by solicitors and counsel who practise in this field that the statutory demand basis for winding up is very rarely used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, what difference has been made in connection with the winding up of companies on the grounds of insolvency? I am pausing now because it is silly to go on talking while the Minister is receiving instructions; it does not do anybody any good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have suffered from that at others' hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. It is one of the difficulties which is inherent in our procedures, and that is why it is simpler to stop and allow the Minister to think about one thing at a time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the propositions advanced by the Minister in support of the Bill and, in particular, of the schedule was that there are two kinds of insolvency proceedings—bankruptcy in the case of an individual, and a winding up in the case of a company. I thought that the Minister had said more than once that the purpose of altering the limits in the schedule was to bring into line the thresholds for bankruptcy on the one hand and winding up on the other. So far, however, my consideration of the schedule and the law relating to this matter has not enabled me to ascertain in what way it is being treated. The only figure being raised which is relevant to the threshold for winding up is the minimum debt upon which a statutory demand can be based, and that is used but rarely. Winding up is usually based on other provisions of the Act than that process. In what way, therefore, is the threshold for winding up being brought into line with the threshold for bankruptcy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two points of general application. They are of considerable importance and we should welcome the assistance of the Minister on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) for having researched the matter in the way he has; it is a service to the Committee. I do not dispute his statement that judgment summonses are not as effective a remedy as they were. I have never disputed it. What I was referring to was my experience in relation to judgment summonses over a period of time, and I am bound to say that the burden which a judgment summons procedure imposed upon the court in the days before 1972 was enormous. The hon. and learned Gentleman was, I suppose, a silk in those days and therefore unlikely to appear in judgment summonses in the Shoreditch County Court on many occasions. However, it had a dramatic effect on the working of the court not only on those days, but on other days too. About two days a week had to be set aside and, although some people were imprisoned and it doubtless had a deterrent effect for a number of people—it would be foolish to deny it—that can be overrated. To see how that could be overrated one would have to go back and try to resuscitate thc experiences of those times for practitioners who were engaged in court then and also for the learned judge who had to sit on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the position cannot be stated quite as blandly as the hon. Gentleman has put it. A heavy amount of research would have to be undertaken in order to analyse the validity of the points which the lion. and learned Gentleman made as against the situation which emerged post-1972, and it might, at the end of the day. be a somewhat waster form of research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless. I will not discount totally the point which the hon. and learned Gentleman made. It would be unfair. He made it in the Committee, and I am not disposed to say that, because I happen at first sight not to agree with the main purpose of his argument, it is something that should be lightly dismissed. Having said that, and having cast some reflections upon the efficacy of the old remedy, I was seeking to point out in the course of earlier debates in the Committee that this was one of a number of albeit inadequate remedies that are available. If the record is consulted, I think it will be found that I said something to the effect that there are several remedies, each of them inadequate in itself, which nevertheless present
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
the creditors with a range of remedies which I need not rehearse again to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that, by doing what we are doing, we are taking away some part of the effectiveness of the bankruptcy procedure. It is a question of weighing the balance of advantage in all this. I would be out of order if I were to go over the Second Reading principles of the Bill again; I got rebuked by you, Mr. English, quite properly for doing that in relation to the debate last Thursday, although I do not think I was the only offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I do not think the hon. and learned Gentleman is making such a mammoth point as his speech seems to suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves that point, may I ask him if he is surprised at the figures that I have given the Committee? How does he reconcile them with what he said at our second sitting, namely that thousands—an enormous number—of judgment summonses are issued and that county courts spend the whole morning perhaps once or twice a week dealing with nothing else? The figures that I have given entirely belie what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the figures have dropped as markedly as they have. However, one must also have regard to the nature of cases arising in individual courts. One will still have today substantial numbers of judgment summonses arising in certain courts. I think that Shoreditch County Court, wherc I used to practise a good deal, still has a substantial number, but I have not practised for some three or four years in the county court and therefore my personal experience may be a little out of date. But I will certainly look into the situation. I did not refer to thousands upon thousands, as the hon. Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An enormous number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said "an enormous number". I do not know what sort of weight 8,500 cases still impose upon the county court agenda; it may be quite considerable. What I do know is that in the old days the position was utterly chaotic; and this may be one of the reasons why the remedy had to be abandoned. Of course there were others, and these were no doubt deployed in
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
debates before the House in those days, when it was resolved that imprisonment for debt should be abolished subject to the qualifications to which the hon. and learned Gentleman has referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman went on to refer to the various distinctions between companies winding up and bankruptcy. That is a matter to which reference has been made earlier. I think that it goes a little wide of the debate on the schedule. That is a matter for you, Mr. English, because we are dealing with matters of detail. I will look at what the hon. Gentleman has said, as I have indicated before, but I hope we shall now be able to finish the debate on the schedule and proceed to the debate on the next clause which falls to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will add a word or two to the careful analysis of my hon. and learned Friend. I was somewhat puzzled by the Under-Secretary's final remark that he thought the points made by my hon. and learned Friend were out of order on the schedule. They seemed to me to be directly related, not to points of detail, but to the heart of this matter, namely: what are the alternative remedies to bankruptcy as a means of creditors obtaining their money. I do not understand why the Minister should feel that those figures are irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. The hon. Gentleman must have been conversing with his hon. and learned Friend. I said that, not in relation to the first point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman, but in relation to the second point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, although I was listening intently. The point which my hon. and learned Friend made is at all events of great importance and seems once again to suggest that the facts upon which the Minister's arguments have been based are not those he assumed when he originally drafted the Bill. My hon. Friend has made a very powerful argument about the alternatives. We have already found that the question of garnishee was insignificant, if not irrelevant. We come now to the other question of administration orders and judgement summonses. The more one looks into it, the more apparent it becomes that the alternatives to the procedures outlined on the bankruptcy side are very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

weak indeed and have been greatly weakened over the years. Therefore, although originally, as was apparent in my initial speeches, I tended to favour a higher rather than a lower limit and so was perhaps more sympathetic to the Government's position, the more I have listened to the debates on this schedule and the related clause, the more I have come to take the view that the case for raising the limit as much as the Government proposed is very weak. No doubt that is why those who are expert in these matters and who practise from day to day in this field have also come to take the view that the Government's figure is too high. Although clearly the £50 limit must be raised, it should not be raised as high as the Government have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my hon and learned Friend's research, instead of saying " We had already looked at these figures, considered them and decided that they were not appropriate "—or whatever it might be—the Minister has said " These figures are not good enough. We need further analyses on which courts they were, what the amounts were, and so on". It is extrarodinary that the Minister, having failed to produce the figures in the first place, complains that my hon. and learned Friend has not carried out an adequate analysis and should have produced even more detail. We should be very happy if the Minister cared to do that; but, in the total absence of any Government analyses, and as the Minister has failed to produce the figures which he says are necessary for a proper analysis, we must take the argument on the only figures which have been produced, namely those of my hon. and learned Friend. As he has rightly pointed out, the accuracy of those figures is not disputed. They are the Lord Chancellor's figures. If the Minister feels that these further points should be considered, if he wishes to carry out a further analysis—something that should have been done already—and since this has not been done already, clearly we will need to return to it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only object of debating the schedule and the related clause has been to improve it. I think that we have made some improvements. We have made some amendments, and the Minister has agreed to look up other matters which clearly we shall need to consider in the light of the amendments which he tables on Report.
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
That being so, I do not wish to delay the Committee. I merely underline the point that my hon. and learned Friend made and what the Minister has himself said—that we do not yet have as much data as we should like. In the absence of that, I should certainly not wish to oppose the schedule as such because it is better than it was. But I stress very strongly that on Report we shall need to go into these matters again and rehearse the arguments in the light of further figures which I hope that by then the Minister will have been able to obtain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we depart from this, which I am anxious to do, I should put on the record two points which are relevant to the first part of the submissions made by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 22nd August 1971, when the Administration of Justice Act 1970, came into effect, under Section 11 a judgment summons is available only for a High Court or county court maintenance order, or a judgment for payment of income tax or other tax recoverable under Sections 65 and 66 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. Therefore, the reduction in the number of judgment summonses as such is due, not only to the abolition of committal to prison, but to the narrow basis of the order upon which it is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have the new remedy which has not been referred to—the attachment of earnings order under the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971, which has proved to be very effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make one or two brief observations on that so that the further matters that have toe, be looked into may be clearer. The Minister says that on the judgment summons morning in the county court things were chaotic. I suppose one could say that. I remember being there waiting for the judge to reach the list of contested cases. It was chaotic because so many people were making use of that process provided for them by the court because they thought it useful. Very effective it was, since, of the really recalcitrant debtors, in respect of whom an order for imprisonment had to be made, 170,000 out of 175,000 paid up. The learned Gentleman does not move me at all, therefore, with the idea of a very busy court which might even be described as chaotic. It was busy because this was a useful remedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
On the learned Gentleman's second point, I should be glad if he would look into that matter again. If he is right that one can issue a judgment summons only in respect of a maintenance debt or a tax debt, the judgment summons has disappeared for all practical purposes as a remedy relevant to what we are talking about. It is simply not available to the kind of creditor about whom we are talking. If the learned Gentleman is right, what we should say is that the judgment summons has disappeared altogether as one of the remedies available to the kind of person whose interest we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the learned Gentleman is right. The judgment summons is available on a much wider basis. But only in the cases that the learned Gentleman mentioned—plus claims for social security—may the court make an order for committal. If that is right, we have reduced the judgment summons to something which is of value to Government Departments but to no one else except wives who cannot recover maintenance from their husbands. On either basis, it is of no value to the kind of person about whom we are talking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first reaction to the further information given the learned Gentleman is that further analysis will show, not that I have overstated the case, but that I may have understated it. I ask him to look at it most seriously and give us any further information that he may glean about it, because, whichever way that further information points, it must be relevant to the later consideration of the Bill and to the all-important question of balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, I was really putting a question to the Minister rather than making a point. The Government say that the schedule brings all kinds of insolvency—whether bankruptcy or company winding-up—into line. Where in the schedule must one look to find anything which produces that effect, other than the increase in the minimum debt for a statutory demand, which is of little practical application?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather surprised that the Minister cannot answer that. The first memorandum submitted by an outside party was that of the Law Society and the Senate of the Bar. I have, I see from the record, been speaking simply of Law Society representations. It is a good deal shorter than " Law Society and the Senate of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
Bar", but the representations which I am talking about in each case are made by a working party of both the Law Society and thc Senate of the Bar—the two practising halves of the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 2 of the working party's first memorandum reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our opinion, if the minimum limit is raised to the sum of £300 as proposed in the Bill this will cause considerable hardship." It continues:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not clear as to what is proposed for the winding up of companies. Section 223 (a) of the Companies Act 1948, which is mentioned in Part I of Schedule 1 of the Bill, deals with the statutory demand by a creditor for paymenl, which is a different matter from the ' minimum debt for winding up'."</p></blockquote>
The question which I posed was therefore raised in the first memorandum submitted by outside parties, but still it seems that it has not received much consideration and we are left without an answer today. I shall not press for one today, because I should prefer to have a considered one. But I am hound to say that I am rather surprised that at this late stage the answer is not readily given, either by the Minister or by the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a bit worried, Mr. English, by your words " We now go back to Clause 2." I was hoping that we were making progress. In terms of the printing of the Bill, the schedule that we have just been debating is related to Clause 1, but I should none the less prefer to say " We now move forward to Clause 2".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 is concerned with the audit of accounts of trustees in bankruptcy and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
liquidators, as the explanatory note points out. It relieves the Secretary of State of the obligation to call to be audited all the accounts of liquidators and trustees in bankruptcy which are required to be submitted to him. However, it still enables him to call for any such account to be audited. Amendment No. 5 seeks to leave out " may " and insert must". You have suggested, Mr. English that Amendment No. 6 should be debated with this. That is right, because it is consequential. A further point is raised in Amendment No. 8, which I shall say a word about in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would provide that the Secretary of State must cause any accounts sent to him under Section 92 of the 1914 Act to be audited; and Amendment No. 6 would knock out the latter part of the paragraph. These are essentially probing amendments, although we may be persuaded otherwise by the Minister later. We are suggesting that the Secretary of State shall continue to have audited accounts which are sent to him under Section 92. The intention is to reduce the burden on the auditing services. I presume that the audit is carried out by the Department as such, but perhaps the Minister would clarify who actually conducts the audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am not clear about, leaving on one side the question of saving of labour on these matter—the auditing of accounts is labour in that sense—is why, this having been the position for many years, the Secretary of State suddenly feels that it ought to be a burden which should no longer be carried by those responsible for the audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point which arises concerns what criteria the Government propose to employ in deciding whether accounts should be audited. Clearly, if one audits all the accounts, one will find out what is wrong, but if one does not audit them it is a little difficult to know which were wrong. It is proposed that the Government will now audit the accounts on a basis of a sample survey of some sort! Will they take 10 per cent. of the total and audit all of those? Alternatively, it is proposed to have some criterion related to the size of the account, so that all accounts over a certain total amount are subject to audit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
This is not in the least clear, as we would not expect it to be from the clause itself, but we want to know on what basis it is proposed to select those accounts to be audited and decide not to audit the remainder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 8 effectively relates to leaving out subsection (3) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the Secretary of State decides not to cause an account to be audited, subsection (4) of each of those sections shall apply as if it required copies of the accounts to be filed or delivered for filing forthwith, and the liquidator shall comply.…"</p></blockquote>
If I understand that correctly, what is suggested is that, if the accounts are not audited, copies of the accounts will have to be filed, and delivered for filing, forthwith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one sense this amendment is consequential on Amendment No. 6: it does not arise if the existing situation is maintained. On the other hand, it raises the question of what will happen to these filed accounts. Will they simply remain for ever filed away? It is curious that the subsection says they shall be " delivered for filing forthwith". I presume that means that no one will look at them 	<i>en passant,</i> but it is a rather odd form of wording, and I am not clear what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful, therefore, if the Minister would spell out in rather more detail than is apparent from the drafting of the Bill precisely what is the intention of this part of it and precisely what they have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal first with the specific questions posed by the hon. Gentleman. It is the Department that carries out the audit. He asked why we should change the procedure. The position is that his own Government had a report put to them in February 1972 by a management review team which was looking into the effectiveness of the procedures employed by the nsolvency Service, particularly having regard to the relationship of modern auditing practice with what went on in the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The team reported in February 1972 that it though that the present auditing procedures being carried on by the Insolvency Services, which are laid down by statute, are wasteful of effort and out of line with modern auditing practice. It recommended certain changes, which are now embodied in the clause. The chief of these was to replace, to a substantial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
extent, the present practice of auditing all accounts by a random spotcheck procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman give us the reference for those recommendations in the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do better than that. I shall take advice on this, but if it is possible I will let the hon. Gentleman have sight of the report. He will understand that there may be some difficulties about that. It is a very substantial report, covering about 50 pages, with a number of appendices, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept that what I have just stated is wholly in line with what the report has proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again, but I am genuinely slightly puzzled by what he said. Could he tell us the precise status of this document and what public statements have been made about it? It seems a little curious on the face of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is opening a document to publication, he should offer to lay it in the Library of the House of Commons. He cannot, within the rules of order, offer it to one hon. Member and not to the rest of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised, Mr. English, that I am not at liberty to release the document to the hon. Gentleman. It is a confidential document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr English. I understand that position and that it was to some extent a matter for you, the document having been mentioned. What I am a little puzzled about, if it was the previous Government's document. is how the hon. Member has it. That is why I asked if its status could be carefully defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have it because it is a matter upon which a detailed and totally uncontentious examination affecting the working of a branch of the Government Service, namely, the nsolvency Service, was carried out, but there was no political implication. As far as I know, no decisions were taken by this Government in relation to the matter, but unless Ministers in the present Government have available a certain amount of the research that was done, how could they propose to pursue the changes that we need? I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman would seek to dissent from
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
that. I hope that he will not pursue the point that there is unconstitutional impropriety here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am merely making the point that, unless I know what the document is and unless the hon. Member is in a position to say what it is, I can take no view on this subject, and I would not wish to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple point is that the management review team reported on its study. Its recommendations, which must have considerable weight, are that the procedures of auditing should be substantially revised; and this is what the amendment seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the Amendments Nos. 5 and 6. The clause is intended to give effect to the recommendations, and the hon. Gentleman's amendment would defeat its purpose. For that reason I must ask the Committee to resist it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, Amendment No. 8 would remove the proposed obligation on the Secretary of State to file accounts with the courts, even though they have not been audited, and the proposed obligation on the liquidators to send summaries of accounts to creditors and contributories, even though they have not been audited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the Secretary of State is under a duty to file with the court copies of all accounts submitted by trustees and liquidators when they have been audited. That is the requirement in every case now. Similarly, liquidators are under an obligation to send creditors and contributories summaries of all accounts as soon as they have been audited, unless the Department has dispensed with this requirement. If we are denied subsection (3) of Clause 2, there will be no such obligation where accounts have not been audited, and creditors and contributories would thereby be deprived of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I turn to the criteria to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The first account will alwav be audited. At that stage it is thought that the points outstanding in the administration will become clear. There will be a further audit of the next account, but if no defects are found in the audit the matter will be subject to sample checking. The final account will be fully audited. I hope that that will result in the saving of a considerable amount of work, but jt will fit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
in largely with the auditing practices carried on in business generally. Therefore, to that extent, it will be helpful in reducing the workload of the Insolvency Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to pursue the points which I made in intervention. Rather, I wish to look carefully at what the Minister has said and consider the position at a later stage. On the substance of the points made, I fully under stand that the Government's desire, which we share, is to remove any unnecessary work from the burden of the Department. I presume that the effect of the clause will be to bring about a substantial part of the savings mentioned earlier. Perhaps the Minister could tell us how much. The Bill is expected to result in a reduction of 100 to 150 staff over the next three years, saving a total of about £;750,000 a year. Could the Minister indicate how much of that saving will arise directly from this clause. I presume that it will be a substantial part, but it would be helpful to know at what cost we are making this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point which arises is that, as I understand it, it is not proposed that there will be some criteria which the Secretary of State. acting through his officials, will apply in deciding whether a particular account shall or shall not he audited. That would not appear to be the position from what the Minister has just said. What he is saying is that the first account will always be audited. I should he grateful—I ask this quite genuinely—if he could explain what he means by the first, second and final accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is actually the first and final of the accounts. As for the intermediate accounts the Secretary of State, through his officials, considers whether their production is advisable in all the circumstances. So it is a wide area of discretion that is left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My problem is a much simpler one. I am not quite clear what is meant by the first, the intermediate and the final accounts. Therefore, I have sonic difficulty in evaluating the suggestion which the Minister has made. I do not want to delay the Committee on this point, but I should be grateful if, in his reply, he could make it clear what first, intermediate and final accounts mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
If it is intended, as the Minister says, that the first account and the final account will always be audited, the clause seems to be a great deal broader than is needed for its purpose. It would merely give the Secretary of State discretion to exercise the changed position exemplified or embodied in the clause in relation to intermediate accounts. That would be a much narrower proposition than the one which we have before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us turn to the position of the so-called intermediate accounts. Those, as we understand it, are again not to be subject to any criteria. It will be a straight sample survey. A given number of the accounts, apparently without regard to their importance, the amounts involved, or any other consideration, will be selected, presumably on a random basis. Someone will simply list all the accounts, stick a pin in the list and decide which one should be audited. What kind of sample has the Minister in mind? Will it still be a substantial sample, or will it be quite a small sample? Again, it would be helpful to have that outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matters concern the filing of accounts. It may be that I have misunderstood the position and that they are moving in the opposite direction to that which I had supposed. I had supposed that subsection (3) was concerned with the situation where the accounts were produced, the Secretary of State decided not to cause an account to be audited, and the accounts were then delivered to him for filing forthwith. I now understand that is not the position. We are saying that the accounts will be produced, the first and final accounts will proceed as normal, but the intermediate accounts will not be audited by thc Secretary of State but will go straight from the accountants to the court. Is that the position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the sample surveys, where it is decided to audit them, they go from the accountants to the Secretary of State and then hack to the court. It will leave the court with an extraordinarily odd set of records; the court will have a complete set of first and final accounts, and a series of other accounts which, because they happen to have been selected in the sample but for no other reason, are filed finally with the court. Anyone going to thc court will find always the first and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
final accounts but not always, for purely arbitrary reasons—arbitrary in the striotest sense of the word—statistically random cases where the accounts are not available. This seems a somewhat curious implementation of the proposals which the Minister originally had in mind and I should be glad if he would spell it out in a little more detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that about 30 staff and £130,000 will be saved as a result of this exercise. That is a quite substantial amount. I should have thought that " first " was " first ", " final " was " final " and " intermediate " was something in the middle. I do not know how else I can define it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the way in which the process is carried out and how it will be altered—I think that is what the lion. Gentleman was asking—at present the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator is obliged to provide the Department of Trade with such vouchers and information as may be needed for the purpose of the audit of an account. The Secretary of State may rcquire that information so that he can form a judgment whether to audit an account. Subsection (2) enables him to call for vouchers and information on the scale that he requires. Further- morc, although the Department has the power to call on the trustee in bank- ruptcy or liquidator at any time to pro- duce his books of accounts and vouchers for inspection, it is the Secretary of State's intention to carry out inspections—this in a way relates to the next amendment we are to discuss—of the premises of the trustee or liquidator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the requirement in subsections (3) and (4) about the filing of accounts, the Department of Trade is obliged to file a copy of the audited accounts sub- mitted by the trustee in bankruptcy or liquidator on the file of the proceedings in court so that they are available for inspection by any person who might be entitled to inspect the file. Additionally, the liquidator, when the accounts are audited, is required by Section 249 (5) of the Companies Act 1948 to send a printed copy to every creditor and contributory of the company which is in liquidation unless the Department of Trade dispenses with this requirement. The subsection provides for the same procedures to be followed even when the Secretary of State decides not to audit the account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
In regard to the filing of the accounts with the court, I suppose we are in some way anticipating events, but with your leave, Mr. English, and as the hon. Gentleman referred to it, perhaps I may reply. Parties which are directly interested in a winding up or a bankruptcy—creditors, contributories, debtors, and so on—are entitled to inspect the court file of the proceedings and visual rights of inspection add nothing to the information that they can obtain as a result of that. It may prove administratively difficult and is likely to increase costs if arrangements have to be made for the Department of Trade copies of audited and unaudited accounts to be inspected. I am advised that it is the court which is the focus of inspection and not the Department of Trade as far as affects people interested in the accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was reading out the reply and I am not sure that he read out the right reply to the questions which I raised. I understand the point he made about the saving of staff. Clearly this is substantial; a saving of 30 staff and £150,000 of taxpayers' money are both much to be desired. But we are anxious that it should not create an unsatisfactory situation 	<i>qua</i> the operation of the accounts. He said he cannot define " first ", " intermediate " and " final " as other than " first ", " intermediate" and " final". I was not clear what was the distinction of the scope of these accounts—what was in the first account as against thc intermediate as against the final—because if we are to start not auditing the intermediate accounts, though wc audit the first and final, it leaves us with a rather piecemeal situation. I should have thought it would be very difficult to audit the final accounts without auditing the intermediate accounts. Be that as it may, I was merely seeking to obtain some explanation of what was included in the first and final accounts and what was included in the intermediate accounts so that we could take a view on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerned the size of the sample. We did not receive any specific reply on that. The third point related to the fact that of the accounts which are eventually filed in the courts apparently the first and final accounts are audited but the intermediate accounts are not audited in every case. n some cases there are simply the first and final
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
accounts and no unaudited intermediate accounts. In short, I am not clear what it is that eventually arrives at the courts under the new system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to define what is in a first account and what is in a final account. These are matters of individual accounting procedures and have to be adapted in each case, as far as I know. One cannot lay down absolute criteria as to what is to be included in those accounts. As far as I know, no such criteria have ever been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be quite wrong to try to establish a definite number of samples which have to be taken or to reduce the area of flexibility which must be available to those advising the Secretary of State in order to make this procedure effective. That may not satisfy the hon. Gentleman, but I am sure that on reflection he will agree that the essence of effective auditing procedures is flexibility, whether in this area or any other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman's points. These are matters of details which require the expert knowledge of those carrying out audits. One relies upon their expertise in detailed technical matters of this kind. This has always been so. All that is happening here is that we are simplifying procedures. n view of the deep research that has been undertaken under the aegis of successive Governments, and having regard to the obvious savings which will result, which the hon. Gentleman applauds, I should have thought that the procedure as envisaged now in Clause 2 will be of considerable advantage and will be timesaving, and I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It seems extremely odd if there is no definition of first, intermediate and final accounts, but none the less the Government say that they will audit the first and the final but not the intermediate account, when apparently, if there is no dividing line, one can shift material from one section to another, which determines whether it is audited or not. That scarcely seems a satisfactory arrangement. If the Minister does not know the answer, I do
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
not wish to press him now, but I shall. On the other point about the size of the statistical sample, the Minister said that flexibility was desirable in these matters. With great respect, ther is no basic for that argument at all. The Government presumably decide that a suitable size for a sample is certain amount, given the risks involved in this procedure. It does not neen flexibility. The Government must know what they think is a reasonable size for the sample.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally. I am still not clear what documents end up filed in the court. Is it a complete set of documents, or will some have quite arbitrarily an intermediate set of accounts include in them which have not been audited?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), did me less than justice by saying that I read out the wrong passages. I dealt specifically with the way in which the Department's auditors will deal with this matter. They are still entitled to receive the vouchers and information which will be provided by the trustee in bankruptcy or the liquidator. It is on the basis of the adequacy of that information that much of the judgment of the Department's officials will be founded. How can one define that issue better than by saying, as I have, that there has to be flexibility having regard to that situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the practice that is adopted by all auditors in business. There is no statutory basis for saying that they want a sample of files in a solicitor's office that they want to get through. It is a questjon of balance and common sense and experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I interrupt only to try to speed up the proceedings. That was not my point. It is not a question of whethcr the auditors have flexibility: it is a question of whether the selection of accounts to be audited by the Secretary of State is determined by a statistical sample. We were told that it was. Therefore there will presumably be no flexibility in that. That is a matter which the Secretary of State determines, not the auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to deal patiently with the points raised by the hon. Gentleman. The first account, I said, will always he audited. He asks what the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
first account is. It consists of the receipts and payments received in the first six months. The intermediate account represents the receipts and payments over a period, at six-monthly intervals. The final account is the last six months of the administration of thc estate up to the date of application for release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of looking at the first account, the points outstanding in the administration, I am advised, become fairly clear. As I have indicated also, the fact that the vouchers and receipts must be constantly available, if there is an inadequacy in processing that information, enables the Department's officials to take a view as to whether the spot checks need to be undertaken more rigorously and more frequently in one case than in another. I hope that I have answered all the points raised by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgings). if he is still dissatisfied on any matters, perhaps we can resolve them by correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Minister has said, I will certainly pursue the course he has suggested. I am still not satisfied. The Minister has not answered the specific points. One thing is clear. If one does not want a particular matter to be audited, one will not do it in the first or last six months of the proceedings. Leaving that on one side, I do not propose to press the amendment. If anything, I am more dissatisfied with the situation than, was before we started to probe this matter, but I will pursue the course of action the Minister suggested. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 5 leave out from " audited " to end of line 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, again is a probing amendment. It is a question whether the accounts shall be produced or inspected at the premises of the trustee or liquidator and whether the Secretary of State shall provide for that. It gives us a little cause for concern. What is suggested is that the provisions which enable the Secretary of State to call for vouchers and information and to require the production of books and accounts for inspection should apply whether or not he decides to call for an
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
account to be audited. As I understand it, he can still require these documents to be produced at the premises of the trustee or liquidator, even though the accounts are not being audited. I was not quite clear what the purpose of that was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman is quite right. This followed very closely a recommendation of the management review team that there should be on-the-spot inspection of the accounting procedures and systems of accounting control at the offices of the trustees and liquidators. It is a question, not simply of calling somebody into the Department but of a team of auditors from the Insolvency Service being able to go along to the offices of the liquidator and trustee and see for itself whether the scheme being operated for the auditing procedure is appropriate in the circumstances and whether there is some reason for dissatisfaction. The amendment would remove the power of the Department of State to implement that recommendation which I think would be unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would just add that, if there were concern on the part of the accountancy profession about this it would have been manifested, but it has not. We have had no representations from the professional bodies expressing any concern about the procedures. I think it adds to the efficiency of the operation. One does not know whether it will ever be used, but the accountancy profession would have been up in arms if it had thought it was a matter of great concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that some members of the accountancy profession are generally concerned about the increasing tendency for Government officials to be able to inspect books on their premises and to get magistrates' orders to do so and so on. That would not appear to be the case in this instance, and I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his reply. I do not wish to pursue the matter, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 32, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister covered some of the points raised by the amendment in his earlier remarks, so I hope we can deal with it briefly. I am not clear whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
this is a change from the existing procedure. I am not sure how many copies are filed. Apparently, it is only the copy at the court which would be open to inspection under subsection (4). Are there other copies? Are we to understand that at the moment they are also held in the Department of Trade, because if so those who wish to inspect them might find it more convenient to do so, particularly if they are dealing with a number of cases at one moment at, say, the Department of Trade rather than gcing round from court to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned about the amendment because on Second Reading I expressed concern that a number of people may find themselves quite wrongly put in the position where they are thought to have a bad credit rating when that is not actually the case, and, therefor, it might be helpful if people could actually examine these documents in a more central location. It is merely a question of whether it is convenient for the public, and whether this is a further restriction being imposed which does not exist at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clear situation is that, although at the moment the Department of Tradc has its copies and the court has its own, it is the copies of the accounts filed with the court which are inspected and, I am instructed, very few, if any, inspections of the copies of the accounts are carried out by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives statutory effect to what is a clear desire on the part of those who seek information from the accounts, namely, to look at the court copies rather than those of the Department of Trade. That is a sensible thing to do. There is no diminution in the availability of the information in practice, and therefore, it is sensible to have this reflected in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by that. This is a restrictive clause. It states that the only copy that shall be open to inspection will be the one at the court. The Minister seems to be suggesting that that is a more convenient arrangement. I am not clear how it is more convenient for those who wish to inspect it. Is it the case that one can now do so at the Department and will not be able to do so in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can. People do not. It is as simple as that. Therefore, why bother to add to the bureaucracy? It is something which I should have thought the hon. Gentleman would be anxious to avoid? The accounts are available at the court. There is the Bankruptcy Registry where these matters can be inspected and examined, and this is where people go. That is the simple situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I still find this a slightly curious argument. If no one ever does it, there is no need to mention it. If someone might like the option in the future, it seems unnecessary to restrict it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If people have not in the past exercised it, as experience has shown, there does not seem to be any point in perpetuating an option which they do not want to exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that the simpler the matter gets, the more unsatisfactory the Minister's reply becomes. I think we shall take advice from those who are concerned with these matters and see whether they think it is a point which ought to be pressed. I did not think that it was at all a good answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply do not understand why, other than for purely bureaucratic reasons, the Department has stuck it in here. I do not wish to press it now. Perhaps I might add, if it is of any help to the Committee, that that exhausts the points on this clause which I wish to press. I would not wish to go into it further on " Clause stand part".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come now to Clause 3, and we are making progress. As the Committee will be aware, Clause 3 and Schedule 2, which we are taking at the end of the proceedings rather than immediately after this clause, provide for the replacement of the Bankruptcy Estates Account and the Companies Liquidation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
Account by a single account called the Insolvency Services Account to be kept by the Secretary of State with the Bank of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, in some ways, a simplification. It unites the two existing accounts—the individual and the corporate—and it will all in future be in the Insolvency Services Account at the Bank of England. That may have considerable advantages, and no doubt the Minister will wish to tell us precisely what those advantages are and why this change has been advocated by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me a little more is what happens to the money. We are told that all the sums standing to the credit of the two accounts will be transferred, and then subsequently, I presume, all the moneys which are received by the Secretary of State in respect of proceedings under the 1914 Act or the 1948 Act will be paid into this single united account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, why is this, unlike the rest of the Bill, concerned only with the 1914 Act and the Companies Act? We do not appear to be concerned with the position in Scotland. I am not clear why that is so. I should have thought there was a case for having all the money in a single account, and if it goes into the Royal Bank of Scotland—which, I presume, is where it lands up otherwise—the advantage to the Government in that will be somewhat different, because the Bank of England is the normal place where Government money ends up whereas the Bank of Scotland is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point is more important. What happens to the interest on the money which the Government collect? We are told that whenever the cash balance standing to the credit of the Service is in excess of the amount which is required, the Secretary of State shall notify the excess to the National Debt Commissioners and shall pay into the Insolvency Investment Account the excess which they will require in accordance with the 1970 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, no doubt the amount will receive a payment of interest. I am not clear what happens to that interest. The Secretary of State has the right, apparently, to withdraw money from the National Debt Commissioners in order to meet the liabilities which he has to meet in carrying out the rest of the Insolvency Service's work, and for that purpose he
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
can direct the sale of securities as may be necessary. But what happens to the interest which the Secretary of State, presumably, will be paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That amount does not appear to be covered at all, and, more especially, it is not clear whether it remains with the National Debt Commissioners—which would seem a rather messy way of accounting for it because it would be effectively a transfer from one Government Department to another—or whether the amount involved eventually goes to offset the deficit on the Insolvency Service as such, or whether the amount of interest involved eventually goes to help those who will otherwise be paid less than the full amount which they would have got if the person concerned had not gone bankrupt or the company concerned had not become insolvent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister could clear up those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation in Scotland is dealt with by the Scottish courts directly, so this is not a matter which falls to be dealt with in the Bill. As regards interest, the scheme of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 is that the interest earned on State funds should be available in full to meet the costs of the Insolvency Service. This was recently confirmed in the case of 	<i>In re</i> Walker deceased, reported in 1974 1 All England Law Reports, at page 551—a Court of Appeal Decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bankruptcies are more numerous than liquidations, but the level of funds from realisations is generally speaking not as substantial as in the case of companies in liquidation, including voluntary liquidations. Consequently, bankruptcies are comparatively more costly than liquidations for the Service to conduct. If a system of allowing interest were to he introduced for bankruptcy estates—this is a matter we referred to on Second Reading—even at a nominal rate as allowed for companies, consideration would need to be given to an increase in the current bankruptcy fees, which are already at a very high level. Any further increases in bankruptcy fees could have the result of discouraging creditors from availing themselves of the procedures for collecting their debts, which is the point which the hon. Gentleman was anxious
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
to make. I should have thought that this would have been counter-productive from his own point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I said that the question of interest generally in insolvencies is difficult and complicated and needs to be considered more profoundly. It should have been in the review that we are carrying out. It is not really appropriate within this Bill to come to any definite conclusion about it. But, I think the hon. Gentleman was entitled to make his point and raise queries. I hope that I have answered him and that we can now proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has covered some of the points I raised. To say that the Scottish situation is not covered by this clause because it dealt with the Scottish courts directly was not an adequate explanation. One is aware of amendments on other vast chunks of Schedule 1, and the reply that it is not relevant as it is dealt with the Scottish courts directly would have been an equally unsatisfactory answer. What on earth does that mean? What happens to the money in Scottish courts? The situation in England and Wales under the 1914 and 1948 Acts is quite apparent, but I am not in the least clear why those who are in a similar position in Scotland should be dealt with differently. Just to say that these matters are dealt with directly by the Scottish courts is unsatisfactory. Do they hang on to the money? If so, what do they do with it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the point about the interest rate. I confess that I am not familiar with the case of 	<i>In re</i> Walker, deceased, but, as I understand the implication of what the Minister was saying, the person concerned was trying to get interest and failed to do so. What is quite clear from what the Minister said is that a great deal of cross-subsidisation is going on here. If the interest actually goes to meeting the deficit on the Insolvency Service, is that really fair? Some bankruptcies are very expensive and cause a deficit, and some more than cover their costs. That point will arise later, probably on a new clause, perhaps in the House on the Nation Life matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should some unfortunate people fail to get the interest in order to cross-subsidise the others? If an Insolvency Service is offered, there are two alter-
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
natives. One would be to put up the fees, which has the unfortunate implications for the use of the Service which the hon. Member mentioned. If it is thought that the fees must be kept down, the alternative is to pay it out from the taxpayer, which, to a considerable extent, is what already happens, as I understand it. It does not seem right that, instead of raising it either from the taxpayer or from the fees of those who are starting proceedings, one should make it fall quite arbitrary by removing the interest from those whose money is being used by the Government. That is rather a curious approach to adopt. The Minister shakes his head, but I am not absolutely sure that he is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not shake my head, and I am not wholly out of sympathy. I said that before. I was shaking my head about something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help if the Minister would nod when appropriate instead of shaking his head in sympathy at the point I am making, as that is likely to confuse and delay the proceedings. There is a serious point here and I make it quite simply. Surely, if the object is to have an Insolvency Service, either it ought to be paid for by fees, with the disadvantages he has mentioned, or it ought to be paid by the taxpayer. Why it should be paid by certain unfortunate people who are involved otherwise in bankruptcy proceedings I am not the least clear. Could the Minister hold out some hope that we can return to that point later stage, since 	<i>In re</i> Walker can be overriden, no doubt, by legislation? Could he, in particular, clarify the position in Scotland, as I am totally in the dark as to what happens there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mysteries of Scotland are not confined to the hon. Gentleman, I assure him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the mysteries of 	<i>In re</i> Walker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the points of substance which the hon. Gentleman raised, I indicated both on Second Reading and a few moments ago that I thought that there was some disparity of treatment here which needed to be looked at. I am neither condemning the present procedure nor justifying it. What I say is that I felt—I volunteered this view earlier on, and it can be checked
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
from the record—that at all events this is a matter which justifies further investigation. It would not be right for me to hold out a promise that we ought to investigate it. When the hon. Gentleman says "at a later stage," he means the Report stage of the Bill. It would be more appropriate to await the result of the wider-ranging review in which this subject will be incorporated. That is the right way to proceed, so I cannot hold out any promise of a further debate in substance on this point on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for his indication, whether by nod or the opposite, of his interest and sympathy. But is it satisfactory to leave it for as long as he is suggesting? If I understand it correctly, one of the results of the clause is, as he said on Second Reading—
	<br><blockquote><p>"This will not simplify the position but enable the day-to-day balances which are not immediately required to be used more efficiently."—[Official 	<i>Report,</i> 3rd March 1976; Vol. 906, c. 1466.]</p></blockquote>
If I may pause there, that is wholly desirable. Then my hon. Friend asks for whose benefit will they be used more efficiently? I think—the Minister is good enough to acknowledge that he thinks there is substance in it as well—that it means that where there is a balance in an estate one is by these provisions enabling the Service to use that money to earn money. That is a good thing not for the owners of the money but generally for the benefit of all persons using the Service, but it could be open to serious complaints from the people who have substantial assets which are earning that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be very difficult to deal with the situation if one came to the conclusion that it was necessary to deal with it? Presumably, there will have to be, as part of this, some record of what interest is earned. The sole question is whether that interest which is earned should be allocated to the bankruptcies which have earned it or whether it should be allocated generally to the Service. It would seem that, once the principle had been decided, it would not be difficult to give effect to what we have in mind, if we came to the conclusion that the money earned should be credited to the accounts whose assets earned that money. Would the Minister have another look at this between now and Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, continue to exercise surveillance on these matters, but I do not think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is right when he says that it is a matter which is capable of relatively easy solution. I am advised that it is not. It is a difficult and complex issue which could engage the interests of Departments other than my own, and I hold out no promise that we shall be able to deal with the matter more effectively on Report, which can be only a short time away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right thing to do is to undertake a proper review of this matter, not a hasty one. There are several anomalies in relation to brankruptcy and declaration which have to be dealt with. That is why we are having a wide-ranging review. It is a practice which has been undertaken for a long time by successive Governments, going, back for 100 years or more. Therefore, I hope that a delay of a further few weeks, or a delay of a couple of years or so, will not embarrass anybody unduly. Certainly, I cannot hope to come forward with any solutions by June, when I suspect we shall be considering the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a good slip. The Minister said that a delay of a further few weeks would not matter and then changed it rapidly to a delay of a few years. It seems to me that the issues are very clear cut. I have already spelled them out and I shall not repeat them. No doubt, various Departments, not least the Treasury, will take a view on this subject overall. We should therefore give notice to the Minister that this does not seem to us to be a complex issue: it is fairly straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changing the 	<i>status quo</i> is never an easy thing to do, but we shall certainly table amendments on it on Report. I hope that by then the Minister will, like ourselves, realise that it cannot be that complicated to sort out the problem. I am sorry to delay him, but I have not had an answer on what happens to money in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained that there are mysteries about the situation in Scotland. I am not wholly familiar with the situation. As I understand it—I may be wrong—the Scottish courts prescribe their own rules for dealing with these matters, and this is the situation which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
has prevailed before. It may all be part of the massive subject of devolution that we shall be discussing in the next Session.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this were not such an amiable Committee and we were not so anxious to make progress, we should no doubt by now be demanding the presence of the Scottish Law Officers. We should then have to adjourn to allow other proceedings to take place. However, as we are anxious to make progress, I merely say that, for probing purposes, we might put down an amendment on Report to discover the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am far from clear that it is satisfactory that the courts should decide it in Scotland. We have just mentioned that who gets the money is at issue, whether it goes to the Insolvency Service or the person whose estate is involved. If the Scots are going round making arbitrary decisions on this, I am not sure that I want them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is a point here about the reliability of the postal services. I have a constituency case running now on a very similar matter where a lady notified by post that she had a claim against someone and it was not received. As far as I can see, she will not get a penny. That is an unsatisfactory situation. It is not precisely a bankruptcy case, but it is a case where, under the law, one has to write in to make a claim. She did so and the letter was not delivered. There is no means of tracing it, and the Post Office denies all liability. It says moreover that it does not have a contract with her. So she will not get a penny, which, in my view, is completely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, this is an innovation. We are asked to recommend that, instead of issuing an affidavit, people should do it by delivering or sending a prepaid letter—not even a registered letter—to the Official Receiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed in the Minister. When I raised the matter on Second Reading, I hoped that he would look at what is a simple point and produce a Government amendment. No such amendment has appeared. If the Minister does not give a reply now, we shall certainly wish to table an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a satisfactory arrangement. People's money—perhaps poor people's money—is involved and the whole thing turns on whether a letter happens to be delivered by the Post Office. I hope that the Minister will now ensure further rapid progress by saying that he agrees entirely with the point which has been made, that one cannot rely on this, and that therefore he will move an amendment to delete this part of the clause on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
table amendments to deal with a point which he raised on Second Reading. I did not table amendments because I did not think there was anything of substance in the point. It is as simple as that. On reflection, the hon. Gentleman may think that, too. Why did not he table amendments to deal with it? He was very remiss in not doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection does not specify how the proof of debt should be delivered to the Official Receiver. The present position is that if it is an affidavit it may be sent by post. The subsection provides merely that the creditor may send it through the post; it does not say that he has to do it that way. The creditor is able of his own volition to deliver the thing by hand if he wants to. He can send it by recorded delivery. He can use any other method of delivery that he feels is available to him. But if he sends the proof by ordinary post he must do so by prepaid letter. That is in accordance with the requirements of the law generally in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To require that all proofs of debt should be sent to the Official Receiver by recorded delivery or registered post would add to the expense which a creditor has to incur in lodging his claim. Not all creditors would want to do that, as I have already indicated, so I do not think that there is substance in the point made by the hon. Gentleman. He indicated that these were preliminary observations that he wished to make, but I did not think on Second Reading that the Opposition were making much of a fuss about Clause 4.

I may have misunderstood the position but, as I undcrstood it, the Minister was saying that one could send an affidavit through the post, which was the old arrangement. So the extent of this change may be less than I supposed. But we still have the problem of the position of a creditor who sends through the post a claim which is not delivered. Is his position protected in those circumstances? Can he say later " Evidently my letter did not arrive, and I want to be included in the list of creditors? That is the point which worries me. I may have been over-influenced by the constituency case in another field to which I referred, though I admit that I have also been over-influenced by the fact that on parking matters one does not always get the letter through the post which one ought to get and one has subsequent problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain worried over the matter, and I had hoped that the Minister would be prepared to meet us. What happens if someone sends the letter through the post and, through not fault of his, it does not arrive in time?

I assure the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that the situation is not inflexible regarding the time limit for the admission of proofs of debt. The sort of situation which he postulates therefore does not arise in practice. Proofs of debt can be submitted later. Someone says " I did not have my letter delivered". The only trouble is that if a dividend is paid and someone has not submitted his proof of debt in time, the dividend that has been paid cannot be upset.

	<div class='title'>POWER TO DISPENSE WITH PUBLIC EXAMINATION OF DEBTOR</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 44, in page 4, line 17, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>";and in determining whether to make an order the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case including, in particular, whether the debtor has made a full disclosure of his affairs, whether he has been adjudged bankrupt on a previous occasion, the number and nature of his debts and whether his bankruptcy would for any reason be a matter of public concern".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 42, in page 4, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) The Secretary of State shall by order prescribe the matters which are to be taken into account by the Court in deciding whelher to exercise the powers given to it in and by subsection (1) of this section".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the major points of substance which arise. In consequence of representations made to me personally by professional bodies concerned—I thought there was significant weight in what was represented to me—I have tabled these amendments. Perhaps it is not altogether illogical to think that, as a lawyer, I would be persuaded in any event of the merit of setting out the criteria to guide the courts when considering whether to make an order dispensing with the public examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would he that, in determining whether to make an order dispensing with a public examination, the court would have to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including, in particular, whether the debtor has made a full disclosure of his affairs; whether he has been bankrupt before; his indebtedness—the number and nature of his debts; and whether his bankruptcy would for any reason be a matter of public concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
The original proposition was that criteria should be laid down in the Bankruptcy Rules as to when the Official Receiver should apply to dispense in a particular case. But, as I have indicated, I think that it would be far more appropriate to provide these criteria in the Bill, to which the court should have regard in determining whether or not to dispense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that the Official Receiver will be under a duty to apply for an order to dispense when he is of opinion that these criteria have been established in a particular case. It is intended, therefore, to seek amendment of the rules to that effect and to provide for a report to be submitted by the Official Receiver in support of his application, drawing attention to the relevant matters and to any objections to an order to dispense which have been made known to him by the creditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pointed out previously that the creditors are encouraged to have a relationship with the Official Receiver, just as the debtors are. If the creditors wish to make an objection, the Official Receiver will take it substantially into account. But the application to be made by the Official Receiver will be made 	<i>ex parte,</i> as it is under the present law where the debtor is unfit to attend the public examination. It may be made only by the Official Receiver because only he is in a position to ascertain whether the debtor has already made a full disclosure of his affairs. But if the trustee or any creditor thinks that the case is suitable for the public examination to be dispensed with, he will be able to go along to the Official Receiver, or write to the Official Receiver, and the Official Receiver will then consider making an appropriate application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not intended to provide in the rules for notice of the application to be given to the creditors or to the debtor. There is no notice at the present time in the case of the debtor who is unfit to attend the public examination, and it seems to be on all fours with the same principle. Amendments to the rules will be sought to provide for a copy of the order dispensing with the public examination to be served on the debtor and notice of the order given to the creditors not less than seven days before the date fixed for the examination. The creditors will, therefore, be aware of the position that is developing. The possibility of an application to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
dispense being made will in any event in all probability have been discussed at the first meeting of creditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the question of public concern, which is always a difficult thing to define. We are saying that public concern is one of the criteria for guiding the court in coming to its conclusion on whether it should dispense with the public examination. That term would include the term " public interest" which has been used in a number of statutes in a wide variety of contexts, indeed, it is used in the Companies Act 1967 in respect of winding up on a petition of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In bankruptcy it is perfectly obvious that one can have a wide permutation of circumstances which the court may be called upon to evaluate in arriving at its judgment on this matter of dispensing with the public examination. It would be extraordinarily difficult to identify more closely the circumstances in which the court ought or ought not to act in any particular context. However, the factors which would generally be borne in mind in assessing the criteria of public concern would be the following: First, the conduct of the debtor both before and during the bankruptcy, as is obvious; second, the publicity afforded by the public examination would not yield a benefit to creditors or the public in general; thirdly, the professional status of the debtor, if he has any professional status, having regard particularly to his obligations, if any, relating to money belonging to clients: fourth, that it would not highlight and prompt public awareness and discussion of some general principle exemplified by the bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not follow that bankruptcy must affect a wide section of the general public before it can be considered to involve matters of public concern. This could happen if only a few people were involved or if other factors were present in any given circumstances—for example, the amount of liabilities or the circumstances in which they were incurred. These are obviously relevant considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the phrase is likely to be taken to imply the absence of unusual features in a, particular bankruptcy, but if one simply referred to that alone it would be most unsatisfactory. That is how it would be colloquially termed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading—this is col. 1483
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
of 	<i>Hansard</i>—the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) suggested that a system should be introduced under which there is no public examination except where one is ordered—that was the first proposition, or, alternatively, that there should always be a public examination if the amount of the liability exceeded £10,000, but otherwise there should not be a public examination save if the court was satisfied on the application of the Official Receiver, the trustee in bankruptcy or a creditor that such a hearing should take place, or if the debtor had been bankrupt on a previous occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of these proposals must be considered in the light of the expected changes in the nature and number of bankruptcies following the proposed increases of the monetary limits. It is expected that the increase of these limits will result in a large reduction in the numbers of small domestic and consumer credit bankruptcies, which are the very cases where an application to dispense with the public examination would have been made anyway. The cases which will then remain to be dealt with are likely to have commercial and professional significance, and it is not expected that many will warrant an application for dispensation of the public examination. Any system under which there is no public examination save where one is ordered is likely, in the changed circumstances which the Committee is contemplating, to result in the need for more applications to the court than would a system requiring applications only when it is wished to dispense with the public examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally, an order to hear a public examination would be much more likely to be challenged than an order dispensing with such an examination. If that were so, it would impose an additional burden upon the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the points which I have made have commended themselves substantially, although there may still be points of relatively minor difference, to the professional organisations which have made representations to me. I have tried to meet them in a constructive way and I hope that this will enable the Committee to make substantially further progress than would otherwise have been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that we are dealing at the same time with Amendment No. 42, and it is right that I should allow the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) or the hon. and learned Member for Southport to develop the points which they wish to make on that amendment. I hope, however, that as a result of the description of the amendment's objectives the Committee will be able to approve the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Fletcher-Cooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a serious matter that the hitherto unrestricted obligation to have a public examination is by this clause considerably cut down. The manner in which it is to be cut down is much improved by the amendment moved by the Minister. As it stood before, it was totally at large. Now the lines upon which the discretion is to be exercised have at least been indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, however, like to know more fundamentally than has so far been deployed whether and why it is right to depart from the old and absolute law. Bankruptcy is a matter that concerns the public. There is no doubt about that. In the old days, the only exception to a public examination, which means the exclusion of the public and the Press, was was not a logical one but one of mercy, in that the debtor was too ill or in other ways incapable of standing the strain. Even there, the public was interested, not necessarily merely in the locality but in the country, and then the service and duties of the Press were very much to the advantage of the community. One should be careful when one seeks to exclude the public and the Press from matters about which they would otherwise be entitled to hear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private examination which is now suggested is a feature of bankruptcy procedure, but the private examination was purely for the purposes and advantage of the trustee. That was why, from time to time, there were private examinations. It was for the benefit of the trustee and the trustee alone, which was quite a different matter from the public examination where, as judge after judge has said—Jarratt is the leading case on the subject—the public interest in this is more important than the creditors, the debtors or the trustee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creditors very often do not want a public examination, if only because a public examination may produce further creditors. Somebody may hear about it. The debtor does not want a public
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
examination, and a lot of people whom the debtor has dealt with—we can all think of many prominent examples of this in the recent history of these islands—do not necessarily want a public examination, because they will be what is in the modern jargon called " smeared".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of that, to my mind, is in itself a sufficient warranty to cut down a fundamental principle of all English legal proceedings, which is [that!there has to be the strongest possible case for the exclusion of the public and the Press from English legal proceedings. They are excluded where the safety of the State is concerned, with official secrets, and they are excluded where children are concerned, because the interests of children are paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that in the case of creditors or debtors, or trustees, the exclusion of the public and the Press is desirable, whatever the professional bodies may say. I have no doubt that it suits the professional bodies as much as it suits the creditors, whether they be professional creditors, or the debtors, whether they be professional debtors; but who is to speak for the public in these matters? The bodies concerned that make representations are not very well organised. The public is always disorganised. It is the Members of this House and of this Committee who represent the public. That is the only way in which the public is organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt, with the best of intentions and with the best of arguments from those who are professionally organised, it has come to be assumed that it will be speedier, as it may well be, less contentious, as it may well be, kinder, as it may well be, and better oiled and smoother, if in many cases, and in particular in what we think of as small cases, the whole thing is done behind closed doors. I do not think that that case is sufficiently made out. I am prepared and open to persuasion on the matter, but I should not like to se Clause 5 stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is to stand, the circumstances and the reasons for excluding the old public examination ought to be far more closely defined even than they are in this amendment. The Minister was very frank. He said that it was difficult to identify more closely the circumstances in which a public examination should or should not be permitted or disallowed. That in itself
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
shows that people have not concentrated their minds on the reasons for the change in the law. What are the reasons? Why are they so overwhelming?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a point here?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I agree with that.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not wish to duplicate the debate, Mr. English, but I hope you will not take a final decision now.

Clearly, you would not wish us to go the other way and bring in totally extraneous matter simply because we know that we shall not have a "clause stand part " debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, I am sure, Mr. English, that you are absolutely right. We must discuss the main principle of the clause as well, but I hope you will keep an open mind and rely on us if necessary to raise other subsidiary points on " clause stand part " but not to do so by going over the main argument all over again, in which case you will no doubt remind us of the previous debates that have taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that I would not allow any debate. I just said that if we debate the principles now I do not want them rehearsed again on "clause stand part".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely subscribe to that view. Let me first acknowledge the fact that the Minister has consulted and discussed this important matter with those who wished to be heard about it and has, as he says, moved his position to accord with accepting the propositions put to him. That, I think, is recognised by all concerned in any piece of legislation as a wholly desirable sequence of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by saying that I think the amendment could improve the Bill. That does not mean that one should stop there. The question is whether one can introduce even more improvements. That is the line that I want to develop, but first let me say that I too, acknowledge right from the outset what has been stressed both by the Minister and by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke. We are talking about something which is immensely important. It has been part of the law for a very long time. It has received most careful consideration time and time again. I think that the two committees of 1920 considered it and made recommendations, and we know that 	<i>Justice</i> considered it and made recommendations. Nevertheless, this is the first time that we are actually proposing to alter it. I have no doubt that the reasons for that are largely those advanced by my hon. and learned Friend when he said that what we are doing is so important that we must get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points in the Minister's speech which I shall want to consider much more carefully than is possible now before expressing any concluded views on this is the proposition which seemed to emerge that it would not affect many cases. His argument, as I understood it, ran that we are excluding from the whole of bankruptcy proceeding many of the small cases by putting a limit of 000; and that of those that are left, if the criteria introduced into the Bill are observed, very few will be exempted from having a public examination. I apologise for the inelegant language. It is not always possible to find elegant language to deal with the sort of point that arises in a highly technical matter like this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Being publicly examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—but I wonder whether the Minister would develop that aspect of the matter, because the considerations that my hon and learned Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
has raised are of the greatest importance, whether they apply to. 10 cases or to 1,000 cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important in the whole context Of the Bill to have some idea whether we are talking about doing away with the public examination in 1,000 cases or 10 cases. If we are thinking about doing away with it in only 10 cases, from the point of view of the burden on the service, which is one of the things we are having to consider in the package deal, it is very unimportant. On the other hand, it could dispense with a large number of public examinations. The Minister and I know that that is the hope and belief of a lot of practitioners. It is certainly the hope and belief of many of those who practice in this field that the public examination will be cut out. I might even go as far as to say that it is in the mind of many of them for it to be cut out in the majority of cases. If it is the Government's intention that that should not be the case, and if it is their belief that this provision would not have that effect, it ought to be clearly stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is directed precisely to the amendment. We are now all agreed that the criteria should be postulated as part of the legal provisions to which all those who have to exercise this jurisdictiion must pay regard. The question immediately arises as to which is the better way of doing it—by setting out the criteria in the statute itself, as would be achieved by Amendment No. 44, or by establishing the criteria by statutory instrument made under a rule-making power. as would be the case if Amendment No. 42 were to be adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make these preliminary observations on the important question of principle which has to he decided in choosing between these two amendments. As we are all agreed that the criteria must form part of the law, the question before the Committee is whether that should he done by adding these directly to the statute, as in Amendment No. 44, or by introducing a rule-making power, as in Amendment No. 42. I direct myself first to that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put to the Minister these two considerations. If I may respectfully say so, in the time that has been available a very helpful draft has been put forward in Amendment No. 44, but there is an aweful finality about what is put into a
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
statute. We all know that if we get it wrong in the statute the likelihood of changing it within a reasonable length of time is remote. In this field we are all groping along together. We recognise that it is desirable to give criteria to the court for its guidance, but if they are to he incorporated in the statute they must be a little more than guidance; they must be things to which a court is required to have regard, and by which it is bound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a subject like this it is particularly difficult to be sure that one has the criteria right in every detail and sufficiently good to survive in that form for a considerable period of time. I acknowledge that in a way, I am arguing contrary to the argument we had on Clause 1 (2). However, there is this difference. Clause 1 is the result, we are told, of lengthy consideration by Ministers and the Department. The amendment which we are now considering results from a change of mind resulting from discussions which started only two months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can give us an undertaking that he will keep an open mind about these criteria at least until Report, and that, having very carefully considered them, he will have consultations with the Law Society and the Senate of the Bar about them, and with those who traditionally and habitually act as liquidators and receivers in bankruptcy. to see whether we may not between us all arrive at a wording which we all consider to he a little better than that which is there. In that case, if it is decided that the criteria should he in the statutes themselves instead of in a statutory instrument, we can combine our knowledge to support an amendment on Report to improve the wording. I hope that he will leave that possibility open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I suggest to the Minister that the rule-making procedure here may be the better one and that Amendment No. 42 may well be preferable to Amendment No. 44 for this reason First, it gives more time to consider what the initial criteria should he and to consider them possibly in a different atmosphere. We are all doing our best in this Committee to consider these things together, but when there is a sitting on Tuesday and another on Thursday it is not so good as for all those who are interested to sit down together to try to hammer out a formula. Tn this field. where we are all trying to make the best

	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
changes, there is a great deal to he said for having Amendment No. 42 and saying that we all want the first set of rules under it to be made as soon as possible. Certainly we do, but we think it would be sensible if everybody concerned sat down in a room in a totally different atmosphere and considered the drafting of those rules. That would be the first advantage of having Amendment No. 42 instead of Amendment No. 44.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do want the court to have guidance in the form of legislation passed by the House of Commons which is binding upon it. The only difference is whether it should be in the primary legislation—in the statute itself—or in a statutory instrument made under the statute—that is,

in secondary legislation. I do not think I am departing in any way from any principle that I enunciated then. If I am, I can only say that what I am saying now is my considered opinion at this stage, and many of us have given a good deal of thought to all these things since we first began to consider them.

My second reason for suggesting that Amendment No. 42 is preferable to Amendment No. 44 is this. A field like this, where we are all groping our way forward, is one in which we are most likely to say after six or 12 months, " Oh good heavens, whydid we not think of that when we started? What a pity we did not think of that and put it in." We must accept that that is a likely eventuality when we are doing the sort of thing that we are here. In those circumstances it would be regarded as a great pity by everybody concerned if, because of what we had done here, we could not put right what had gone wrong or if we could not give effect to what we wanted to do—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
