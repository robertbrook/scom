	<div class='page-header'><h1>AGRICULTURE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL</h1></div>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>—[	<i>27th January</i>]—That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When our previous Sitting ended I was discussing the problems that could arise on common land on enactment of the clause. I wondered who would be asked to pay if the Minister found himself having to use his powers to ask his officials to do work on common land. It would seem an almost impossible task if it had to be paid for by those who had common rights of one sort or another. The Minister might pay with no reasonable prospect of getting the commoners to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point occurred to me later than the last moment for tabling an amendment. It concerns the provision in subsection (9) about affixing notices to a conspicuous object on the land. I suspect that most Members do not serve in the House for very long without receiving correspondence from constituents in rural areas about notices which are said to have been affixed to conspicuous objects on the land but the existence of which all the local people deny. Myriads of people will claim that every day during the previous three months they walked their dogs past the piece of land but did not see the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always thought that this wording leaves a good deal to be desired. It is similar to that which appears in other legislation. I hope that before Report the Government will consider better wording, such as "Fixing it or a copy of it to some conspicuous object on the land which is readily visible from all rights of way across or near or adjacent to that land."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
I hope that the Minister will reply to the questions that I have put, that my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) put, and others from my hon. Friends and hon Gentlemen who have been strangely quiet on the Government back benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some interesting and useful points have been made during discussion on the clause. I shall do my best to answer those which I have not already dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should deal first with the concern reflected in the speech by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) about the effects the clause might have on the availability of hops for traditional beers. As the hon. Member pointed out, hops are used for flavouring and imparting the bitter taste to beer. Many brewers prefer to use particular varieties of hops. Some of these are better grown seeded than seedless and growers will continue to be able to grow them. On the other hand, seedless hops are currently being used in brewing beers in wide demand in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Morpeth (Mr. Grant), who takes an interest in these matters, has informed me that the famous Federation beer is brewed from seedless hops. Hon. Members will he aware that more Federation beer is consumed within these precincts than all the other varieties of beer together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Lord President of the Council has advised the House and me personally that there are not the facilities in this place for the sale of real ale. So the Minister's remarks are inapplicable to traditional beer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a slightly different point. I should say that I rely heavily on my hon. Friend the Member for Morneth ac our adviser in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the seedless lions are imported. This provision will facilitate the diversification of the British hop growers' products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirements of brewers make it extremely unlikely that more than part of British hop production will become seedless in the foreseeable future. Growers in Hampshire whose acreage amounts to about 5 per cent of the United Kingdom total are likely to want
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
their area to be the first to be designated under the clause. Timing will depend upon practical considerations, but an order may be made in late 1976 for the 1977 season.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) asked about the procedures following designation. The procedure for designation itself is fully set out in the clause, but an additional consideration will be the existence of a suitable body of local growers able to assist in the transition to seedless hop growing. Once an area was designated it would be initially for this body, helped perhaps by officers of the Hops Marketing Board, to detect male hop plants and seek the voluntary co-operation of occupiers in destroying them by grubbing or by chemical treatment. On the basis of their experience during three or four years of seedless trials, and the work which is presently progressing in Hampshire, we expect few cases of difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, where it is not possible to inspect land on which growers have reason to believe male hop plants are growing they will request the Ministry to exercise the proposed rights of access and inspection. If the Minister is satisfied that there are male hops on private land which have not been voluntarily destroyed, he will serve a notice requiring the occupier to destroy the hops within a specified period depending upon circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall certainly consider the remarks of the hon. Member for Westmorland about the issue of a notice when the occupier is not there. But I think he would be the first to acknowledge that the matter does not relate only to this legislation but has wider implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the occupier defaults, officers of the Ministry will destroy the plants themselves and be empowered to recover the costs of any action necessitated by a defaulting occupier. These costs will clearly vary according to individual circumstances which will often not be known until the job is actually done. It has been suggested that the defaulting occupier should be given an advance estimate of the cost of the work. It may not be possible to provide an accurate estimate in advance, but it could also he argued that to give an occupier the choice of whether to do the work him-
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
self might be an encouragement to commit an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked by the hon. Member for Macclesfield for an estimate of the cost of clearing male hops. It is difficult to be precise because of varying circumstances. However, I am told that a representative figure for the removal of male hops from a hectare of a commercial hop garden would normally be under £20, representing costs of direct labour and materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some of the miscellaneous points made by the hon. Members for Westmorland and Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), beginning with the treatment of male hops on common land. Common land is no different from other land so far as occupancy is concerned. All common land is or can be "occupied" no matter what rights exist upon it. The occupier may be, say, the local authority, the National Trust or a private individual. They are responsible for any hops on their land and only they or the Minister in the exercise of his powers under the clause would have any right to remove male hops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appeared to be some misunderstanding of my remarks about the action that might be taken under the clause with regard to ornamental hops. The important provision of the clause in this context is in subsection (5), which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister may serve a notice … requiring him"</p></blockquote>
the occupier—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take … such steps for the removal treatment or destruction … for the purpose of preventing those plants from becoming or remaining an actual or potential cause of pollination in female hop plants".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, if for genetic or other special reason there is no risk of pollination, no notice need be served, but, in order to establish this, adequate powers of inspection must be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I must return to the repeated suggestion of the hon. Member for Holland with Boston that the clause would make it an offence to grow male hons. That is not so. There are two offences under the provisions of the clause. Subsection (7) makes it an offence not to comply with a notice served by a properly authorised person. Subsection (10 makes it an offence to obstruct an official in execution of the powers given to the Minister. These are principles which are well established in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
We have had a thorough debate on the content of the clause, and I hope that the Committee will agree to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER TO OBTAIN AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there are many matters on the clause 6 which will delay us for long. We have tabled no amendments, but there are one or two matters which arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only clue that we have had so far to the reason for including the clause in the Bill is the Minister's statement on Second Reading. Although it was short, it may be as well to remind ourselves of what he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 6 slightly widens the power to collect agricultural statistics under the Agriculture Act 1947, in order to meet the needs of the Government and the European Community. It brings in land which is being used for forestry and land which is not being used at all but which could be used for agriculture or forestry. In each case the land must be associated with an existing agricultural unit in the same occupation."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1274.]</p></blockquote>
This gives rise to a number of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the Government are now beginning to take a closer interest in forestry. I have no doubt, Mr. Costain, that you would immediately rule me totally out of order if I were to refer to the ravages of the capital transfer tax on the forestry sector. For that reason I shall not pursue the matter. [Hon. Members: "Carry on."] It seems that some of my hon. Friends feel very strongly about these matters, as I thought they would. Some of them may wish to draw attention to the tremendous decline in planting and the destruction—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am more in agreement with the hon. Gentleman than with his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That pleases me very much, Mr. Costain. I hope that that goodwill will continue during the remainder of the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
It is important to know what will be the effect of this extension of the Government's power to gather statistics. What will cause the greatest difficulty is the following wording in the new subsection (1A):
	<br><blockquote><p>"not used for any purpose, but capable of use for agriculture or forestry".</p></blockquote>
Vast tracts of land in Britain come within that description. It is no bad thing that we should have a better knowledge of what land might be used for a more productive purpose. Although my knowledge of this country extends very little south of the River Thames, I have on occasion visited parts of Surrey, for instance, where it has always seemed to me that many enormous tracts of land not used for any particular purpose could be used much more profitably, especially for forestry purposes. I believe that the quality of the land is extremely poor. Clarification of this matter would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, and as the Minister indicated, the clause refers only to land which is associated with an existing agricultural unit in the same occupation. Although I am not at all anxious that there should be increased numbers of civil servants going round seeking out large tracts of land which are not used for any purpose, and are not associated with an agricultural holding, I should like to see more land of that sort being brought particularly into forestry use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that at present there is not much land associated with an agricultural unit which is not being used for any purpose. It would be helpful if the Minister could give an idea of how much land he guesses might be available. Clearly he will say that that is why the Government want the power to obtain the statistics, but I am sure that the Government must have some idea of the amount of land available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context it would be helpful if the Minister would refer to the evidence which he gave to the Select Committee on European Secondary Legislation, etc. on 4th November concerning the Community Instrument R/1131/75 together with an earlier instrument. I have been told that the number of the earlier Instrument is wrongly given in the report of the Committee's proceed-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
ings as R/5999/74. The Parliamentary Secretary gave evidence to the Select Committee on the documents, which propose that Community grants of 25 per cent. might become available for land to be used for forestry purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it is the provisions of that directive which have caused the Government to want to change the law in the way that the clause proposes. I suggest that we can receive extra money from the Community only if the clause is enacted. The Minister said in evidence that he was unhappy about the effect of those directives. One remark in that evidence that made me raise my eyebrows was that he was concerned that it would
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage the one-way traffic of land out of agriculture into forestry".</p></blockquote>
Reading the hon. Gentleman's evidence, I felt that he was perhaps being a little short-sighted in making such a bald statement. I know that he qualified it to a certain extent, but there is evidence that it would be to the benefit of agriculture in many upland areas if a good deal more afforestation were planned. I am sure that the Minister is well aware, from his Scottish experience, of the need for the provision of shelter belts, and of their advantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently I read a pamphlet produced in connection with a major agricultural redevelopment project in Argyllshire, where the effect of clever afforestation has meant that the land is infinitely more productive than it was, and far more people are employed in that area as a result of the integration of forestry and agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we agree to the clause, I hope that that does not mean that, although the Government will collect the statistics that the Community will require, they will not make the fullest possible use of Community grants which may be available to integrate forestry better with agriculture. I have always thought that if we could persuade and encourage occupiers of land, and particularly working farmers, to become more involved with forestry, the economy of the areas would leap dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, we are basically not opposed to giving the Government these extra powers, but we should like to have a good deal more detail about their use and what the Minister thinks is involved.
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
When he has the statistics, to what extent does he feel that forestry could be encouraged and the provision of Community grants better used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister a few questions on this subject. First, is he happy about the accuracy of the statistics which he and his Ministry gather now, before they ask for extra statistics? In health and immigration wrong figures were given which led to a great deal of misunderstanding across the country. I hope that that will not happen here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister have sufficient checks? Are the statistics, when gathered, not just put into a pigeon-hole but used for the strategy which the Ministry may later introduce? Statistics are extremely important, but to be used properly they must be as accurate as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, although it may be some other Department's province, I should like to be assured that the Minister is aware of all the waste land outside our big cities and can influence its use. When I come to London by train I am appalled by the amount of waste land for 10 to 15 miles outside Liverpool Street station, for example. It is shocking to see the amount of land going under bricks and mortar every day and being wasted to agriculture and food production for ever after. T know of only one aerodrome in my constituency which has been broken up and the concrete taken off, at great expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister has full facts about the matter, and that his Ministry is involved in deciding whether particular land might be brought back into food—growing and forestry, even if it is partly for amenity. Do we know accurately the amount of land going out of agriculture yearly? Does the Ministry impress upon local authorities and all Departments the need to keep good agricultural land? Today even secondary agricultural land is vital for food production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) talked about the importance of forestry. He knows more about forestry and its integration with agriculture than T do. There is a large area of land, light land, in Norfolk and adjoining counties. where forestry could be far more integrated with agriculture, to provide shelter belts, amenity planta-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
tions and forestry products for fencing and other purposes on the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Ministry concentrates on using all the land in this tiny island to best advantage, some good may come from gathering statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put another angle on what my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has said. It is not so much a case of false statistics as misleading statistics. None of us likes filling in forms, and we must make certain, if we must fill them in, that what we are doing is worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the initiative for this matter has come from the EEC and that it is necessary for the Department to have such statistics. But it seems to me that misleading ideas might arise unless certain changes are made. For instance, the new subsection (1A) includes the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but which, if used as agricultural land by the occupier of that agricultural unit, would be comprised in that unit."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, the purpose is that a farmer engaged in forestry outside the confines of his unit would not be brought into the statistics, and rightly, because the land could not be farmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what about the farmer who undertakes a forestry business as well, and is therefore operating dedication schemes under the Forestry Commission within the confines of his unit? It seems to me that the Ministry, first, does not want to know that and, secondly, should not know, because it would give a misleading statistic. The Department wants to know about land which is under-used for one reason or another or land that could be used for forestry. These statistics should not include land within the confines of the units which are under dedication agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree. If I am I should be grateful if the Minister would enlighten me. These statistics may give a result which does not deal with the acreage of unused land and would also distort the forestry statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what my hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) and Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) have said about how misleading some statistics can be. I may be the only member of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
Committee who filled up the first of these census forms, in 1939 at the age of 10 or 11. Everyone was busy on the farm and I was given the job of counting up the different items of stock. I remember doing it very badly. Nobody cared very much and I gathered that most of my neighbours had the same attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tear that that rather cavalier attitude towards statistics for Ministry officials prevails today in many areas. For that reason I feel doubtful about the validity of some of these statistics and the judgments that are formed as a result of them by the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask first about the number of staff that will be engaged and whether there will be any risk of overlapping with the work that must be done to make the Community Land Act effective. I understand that a great deal of research into land use will have to be done by the Department of the Environment. Presumably that Department will be gathering statistics. Will it be possible to prevent overlapping when two Departments are doing the same kind of work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister amplify subsection (	<i>e</i>) as set out in Schedule 2? The new powers will enable the Minister to inquire into the methods and operations used on the land. This may sound rather inquisitorial to some people. May we hear in advance what he has in mind? I appreciate what my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West said about so much of the land near to London being apparently wasted, but I am not sure that it is wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to sound critical of ramblers and others who go over one's land. Most farmers do not mind them doing so. Nevertheless, there has been a great increase in the number of people from the towns and suburbs who want to take advantage of the amenities of the countryside. There is a strong case for having the kind of areas about which my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) spoke, south of the Thames. He spoke rather disparagingly, as if there were no real farming south of the Thames. I join issue with him on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are areas of common land—one member of the Committee may have a very close understanding of this problem—where little farming out
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
wardly seems to be done, but to which many members of the public have access. It is not always a bad thing that they should have access to that kind of heathland, which one might call sub-forestry land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt my hon. Friend to clear up a misunderstanding. I was not talking about common spaces, open spaces, even Hackney Marshes, which now, unfortunately, seem to have become a dumping place for cars.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I also clear up a misunderstanding. This clause is about statistics, not planning appeals or planning proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows only too well that the Community Land Act is playing a notable part in extending the number of such areas. Will the Minister be good enough to tell those of us who may have to fill up these wretched forms, and provide all these beastly statistics, more of what he has in mind when he wishes to know more about the methods and operations to be used on the land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My county NFU recently applauded the new land classification maps brought out by the Ministry. Thanks to the courtesy of the Minister, I have been furnished with all the reference data and have been able to supply my county with access to those documents. If the assumption of my county NFU is correct that these are new land classification maps, an updating, why is this extra information now sought? What is the validity of this recent edition? Do the maps have the utmost validity, or are there still many question marks about them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause, relating to the power to obtain agricultural statistics, does not increase the burden of form-filling on farmers. It is a tidying-up operation and has been included in this Bill for three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the 1975 EEC Survey on the Structure of Agricultural Holdings—Directive 75/108—required more extensive coverage of the area of woodland
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
and other land, including unutilised agricultural land, than was normal under the June agricultural census. Further EEC surveys proposed for 1977, 1979 and subsequently are expected to impose the same requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would be extremely difficult to have a wider coverage in some years than in others. Furthermore, such a situation would not encourage the return of accurate statistics. Consequently, the two relevant questions on the June 1974 census form were expanded in preparation for the 1975 Survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, doubts were subsequently raised, while the directive was awaiting approval by the Council of Ministers, that too wide an interpretation might have been placed on the relevant sections of the 1947 Act. Hence it was decided to seek amending legislation so that the issue could be put beyond all doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the important point which some hon. Members have not appreciated, although I tried to make it clear on Second Reading. The questions are already on the form, but there is doubt about whether there is a statutory basis for them. All that we are doing is making sure that the questions we are asking are not 	<i>ultra vires</i> and have an unchallengeable legislative back-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of points have been raised. What I have said indicates to some extent that most of them are not relevant, but I shall touch on them briefly. The wording of the clause may appear confused. Basically, however, it is generally understood that land cannot be comprised in an agricultural unit unless it is being used for agriculture. It is for this reason that the clause applies to land which, if used as agricultural land by the occupier of an agricultural unit, would be comprised in that unit. Use as agricultural land imports use as such by way of trade or business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "agricultural holding" as used in EEC instruments corresponds to the United Kingdom statutory term " agricultural unit". The United Kingdom statutory term "agricultural holding" is restricted to agricultural holdings which are tenanted. "Agricultural holding" in the EEC sense includes units which are owner-occupied as well as those which are tenanted. The term "agricultural holdings" in the published United Kingdom volumes of agricultural
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
statistics has the same extended meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked to what extent the clause will bring in additional land. It will bring in very little additional acreage. Perhaps I should say rather that the acreage covered by the questions for which we are giving the adequate statutory back-up will be small in relation to the total acreage— a few hundred thousand acres out of about 27 million acres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) asked about forestry and shelter belts. He expressed views on the subject which I think we all accept. I certainly accept what he said about the value of shelter belts. However, it was stretching the point a little to refer to evidence that I gave on the EEC forestry directive. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises that in deciding the Government's attitude to any EEC regulation or directive we have to take into consideration a large number of national issues—for example, how much money we would get out of the European kitty if the directive was adopted. One of the reasons why the Government take, and I suspect a Conservative Government would take, a cautious attitude to this Directive is that we stand to get a smaller amount of money under an EEC Directive on forestry compared with the more important forestry countries in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not disagree, however, with anything that the hon. Member for Westmorland said. There can be no question but that we want to encourage the provision of shelter belts. We recognise the contribution they can make to increasing net productivity in a holding, but it is a question of the best way to do it—whether by national legislation or on a Community basis using Community money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of points were raised by the hon. Members for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), Buckingham (Mr. Benyon), Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) and Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). First, I have explained that we are discussing a very narrow issue. It simply relates to the questions already on the census form for which we want adequate statutory backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a high regard for accurate statistics. I say that as someone who has
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
taken an interest in statistics for many years, particularly in my previous employment. We all recognise the necessity to ask for information which is needed and justified and which, when processed, will lead to real benefit. Asking for information which cannot be justified is wrong. There is always a temptation for people to ask for too much information, just in case they might need it. Asking for information involves time and money, and therefore a balance must be struck. We strike a fair balance in the Ministry of Agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can make random checks on the accuracy and reliability of the statistics. We regard them as being sufficiently reliable for their purpose. I was somewhat disturbed by the way in which the hon. Member for Holland with Boston flaunted the irresponsibility—which he seemed almost to condone—on a holding that he was associated with in his younger days. It is unfair to suggest that the farming community is as irresponsible and unpatriotic as to adopt the sort of attitude to census forms that he seemed to adopt, albeit in his very young days. From my experience in my locality in Scotland—although in Scotland we may take a slightly more responsible attitude—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that the grievous sin I committed was at the age of 10. But one needs only a very small percentage error—less than 10 per cent.—on a large number of farms to have a magnified error when the computer eventually produces its final result. I an! not saying that farmers are irresponsible, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary does not believe that. But farmers can be rather cavalier about this. A number are—especially the older generation—but I am not saying that all are. I do not think that the new younger generation—my generation and the hon. Gentleman's generation—are as cavalier. When they are busy, harassed and have much to do, particularly on smaller farms, they may produce statistics which have a considerable error in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with some of what the hon. Gentleman said, but I disagree that errors in the compilation of statistics are automatically magnified
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
when the statistics are put together. If the error is randomly distributed round the actual figure—in other words, if as many farmers over-estimate as underestimate, on average—the value of the error in the mean for the whole country would be substantially less than 10 per cent. I cannot think offhand why a farmer should want to overstate or understate the amount of stock, but if there were systematic overstating or understating there would be a 10 per cent. error across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have taken the opportunity to speak about the need to minimise the loss of land to agriculture. We accept that. We also accept—and this was stressed forcibly in the passage of the Community Land Act—that it is important to a greater extent than in the past, that where local authorities own land which is to be used for housing or other development it should be left in agricultural production for as long as practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all agreed about the desirability of minimising the loss to agricultural production of good agricultural land. In planning we must strike a balance between the need for more housing and land for development and the need to minimise the loss of good agricultural land, as opposed to poor, mediocre land.

Some general points were raised which I cannot go into at length. I shall write to the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge to answer the point he raised concerning the new classification of agricultural land. There are a number of matters which we could explain to him which he might wish to pass on to his local National Farmers' Union branch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be most grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary does that.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like all hon. Members, I attach great importance to making available to Members of Parliament in particular any information which the Government have available.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could "relevant land" in the statistics also be shown in the Forestry Commission's statistics? The Minister has not answered that point which I raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Basically, the hon. Gentleman is right. We are not collecting forestry statistics here. We have relied traditionally on the Forestry Commission to provide us with statistics for both the State and private sector. The Forestry Commission has an intimate relationship with the private sector, particularly through the dedication schemes. What concerns us here is land associated with an agricultural unit which may one day come into agricultural production. There will always be scope for argument in this connection. Things are not quite as black and white in some instances as we might wish. These agricultural censuses are not aimed at actual forestry statistics, or information about a separate forestry enterprise, albeit one owned by the same person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<section>
	<div class='title'>ADAPTATION OF ENACTMENTS TO METRIC UNITS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 50, in page 7, line 42, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) above the competent authority shall cause to be printed in any Price Review or grant announcements, Regulations, etc., the non-metric units and terms alongside the metric equivalents".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is clear. I think I have a half-open door, because on Second Reading the Minister said that he hoped that these figures would be included in the Farm Price Review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
There are three things about which we should be sure when we go metric. First, everyone in farming and connected with it should understand the working of metrication. Many people in farming, particularly in smaller units, do not have secretaries or others to advise them, and they are extremely busy people. Therefore, every effort should be made to explain and ensure that there is the fullest possible understanding of this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we should be sure that everyone is ready, particularly those who manufacture weighing machines and other items. One of the publications of the Metrication Board talks about a certain number of Ordnance Survey sheets being available. But I think that only a few sheets are available in hectares, and so on, at present. I hope that the process can be speeded up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we must ensure that it is as little inflationary as is humanly possible. Whatever was said on both sides of the House, decimalisation was inflationary, and there is no getting away from it. I only hope that this measure will not be greatly inflationary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be in a minority in this Committee, but I still have the greatest difficulty in visualising the kind of temperature meant by any centigrade degrees when they are read out over the radio, whereas I know at once what 70 degrees fahrenheit means. Going metric in farming is even more important. Large sums of money could be lost by farmers, merchants and other people if they do not understand what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tons or tonnes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Before going into detail about which products or services are covered, one should have a brief look at the history of metrication in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there were Acts in 1864 and 1897 which legalised certain uses of metric measures and established the dual system of metric and Imperial. Coming to the present time and my period in the House, in 1965 and 1968 the Government of the day stated their determination to go metric and established the Metrication Board. In 1972 came the White Paper on Metrication. Its main conclusion was that the process should be gradual, not one M-day for every product. There were negotiations
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
with the EEC and, if I am correct, the understanding with the EEC was that we would go metric by 1979, but allow goods to be sold in this country in metric units by 1976. With a lot of products that has already happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the general principle of metrication, I do not think there has ever been a vote in Parliament. No metrication Bill has been introduced, and I do not think that the White Paper was even debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Supply Day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have got it wrong, but I did not think so. It seems wrong because, whatever happens, metrication will cost a lot to certain industries. In an industry with which I think members of the Committee know that I am connected—an agricultural livestock market in King's Lynn—the cost of altering the weighbridges there will be £989. Apart from that, there will be the alteration of all the forms that will be necessary. and getting people used to selling in quite a different manner from what they have been used to before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the form which sets out the timetable has been altered, so far as fatstock is concerned, and put back from March this year until 31st December. I hope that that will enable everybody to be ready in that industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in order to fix the terminal date for non-metric units there has to be an amendment to the Weights and Measures Act 1963, and I would like the Minister to confirm whether that is so. How will it be dealt with so far as agriculture is concerned? Supplies, marketing procedure and Government work will be affected. It is set out in "Going Metric", a pamphlet which I do not intend to read out. The timetable in this publication sets out the headings of the different supplies, types of marketing and Government activities with which this amendment is concerned, such as publishing the annual review prices and so on in imperial units as well as in metric units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a big change for the countryside. Traditional methods have grown up over hundreds of years. In my part of the world we still talk about a coomb, meaning a sack, of barley. Two coombs equal one-quarter. We have to clear our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
minds of all that—I think I never shall. but I am not actively engaged in farming, so perhaps it does not matter. But a large number of people have grown up with the old expressions so we must make the new as simple and understandable as possible. Otherwise many of the smallholders and other people, who are highly intelligent but have an enormous amount of physical work to do and do not have much time for paperwork, will be losing money as a result of the Bill, which I agree with in principle. We must get the message through to the average farmer as clearly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the question of more Ordnance Survey maps being made available more quickly. I believe Averys hopes to be ready but I know that some of the butchers, greengrocers and fisnmongers are worried about being ready for the changeover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not seeking to stay the Government's programme, expensive and difficult as it may be for many farmers and other traders to operate. I want a really all-out effort by the Board on the ground, in the farming districts, markets, corn halls—in fact, everywhere where farmers meet—to put this over, and it must be done by people who can talk farmers' language. It is not an easy job and I do not know whether the Metrication Board is geared up to do it. I hope it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In seeking this all-our campaign of clarification, I feel that the amendment would give considerable help. I welcome it and I know hundreds of other people would as well. I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) said on Second Reading. He said that he saw no chance of being able to complete this process before the February Price Review, and therefore he re-emphasised that imperial units should be published with the new metric units. I echo all that he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that hon. Members would be grateful if the Government would accept the amendment or produce one along the same lines. I should like the Government to give assurances about the campaign being conducted by the Metrication Board. Time is short. Many
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
documents will be coming in through the year 1975ߝ76. I read my local papers religiously, as every Member of Parliament has to do, but I have not seen much publicity on this subject. I should like an assurance that financial help may be given to people who will be put to a great deal of expense. Whether that is possible, I do not know, but I ask it so that conversion may be done in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I hope that the safeguards asked for by my hon. Friend on Second Reading will be provided. The Minister has already agreed in principle that the amendment is the right way to go about it, I want it written into the law of the land, and I sincerely hope that he will consider the matter carefully and accept the amendment. If it is not correctly drafted, I hope that he will produce an appropriate amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. — [Hon. Members: "	<i>Hear, hear."</i>] There were good attempts from the Opposition Front Bench to seduce me into speaking. All I can say is that I am seduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal of sympathy with the Opposition's view. I should have thought that the very example given in the Bill, Clause 7 (1)(	<i>b</i>), using the word "acreage ", almost of itself proves the need for the insertion of the traditional figures. Most of us get an intuitive grasp of size. We know what 10, 20 and 30 acres are, but once we are dealing with the new Common Market definitions, hectares and so on, there will be difficulties, apart from the tactical aspects such as regulators and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to comment on the expense angle, raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). Of course the change will lead to expense. Decimalisation led to expense on the part of Government bureaucracy. This change will require a great deal of money to be spent. We know that. But there will be expense, too, for people further down the line, those who will have to operate the system. The measurements given by the hon. Gentleman, in sacks and other units, can be judged by those with the knowledge. They sense the bulk of the product with which they are dealing. I think that it will be extremely difficult, not so much for younger farmers but more especially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
older farmers, to make the translation from one system to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review and regulations will be produced. In costing, the farmers will have to make their calculations and try to do the arithmetical equation. We ask that it should be done for them so that they may grasp it quickly. They will do it in any case, but they may be left with slight hesitation through dealing with alien terms. This is by no means the least of the prices we have had to pay for our entry into the Common Market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been envisaging the kind of ludicrous position we could get into under subsection (2). I take it that " the Secretary of State "where it says" Minstry and the Secretary of State means specifically the Secretary of State for Scotland or, the Secretary of State for Wales, as defined in subsection (7). Heaven knows what will happen to our poachers if they have to throw back a 5.2 cm fish—we shall practically be destroying one of our basic national industries in Scotland if we interfere with poaching. The fishermen I know best are those on the North-East coast of Scotland, and I think that the whole question of nets, fish size and other regulations will cause enormous difficulties if we make this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I ask for is sympathetic consideration of the matter. There are two arguments against accepting the hon. Member's suggestion. One is the expense of adding, in brackets, what the figures mean in whole terms. I do not think that that task would entail enormous expense. In any one draft regulation an official need make only a two-minute arithmetical calculation. Then the information is printed. The problem arises at the other end of the line, for the people who have to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument is the one that says that if we do not do this we shall not force people into thinking in the right way. They have not succeeded in forcing me. Each time I give 75p to a taxi driver, as I walk away I say, " My goodness. That cost me 15 bob." We all do it. When I drive in Europe, I have to divide the mileage in half and add on a quarter. I do it automatically before I know whether or not I am breaking the speed limit. We all do this kind of thing. We often use a little formula of our own. We are asking that this system
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
be expressed in a formula in a number of directions, concerning various orders and regulations. The hon. Member's proposal is a modest one and I hope that the Minister will deal with it sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there are forces within the Ministry which are trying to tell us not only to be in the Common Market but to think Common Market. I understand that. Knighthoods come from such an approach. But I hope that we shall bear in mind the people who will have to operate the system, and be kind and gentle. I hope that we shall put in brackets what "tonne" means and what "hectare" means. The man who adopts that helpful attitude will go down in history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn E. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the views expressed by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). We have an interesting time in our home these days, with my wife and I continually changing the decimal currency into shillings and pence. Our children do not understand what we are talking about. They have become used to the one system and have never used it alongside shillings and pence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked carefully at our experience with weather forecasting. Over a long period we have been used to having temperatures expressed in fahrenheit and centigrade. From that experience I feel that people have not adapted readily to the new centigrade system. They still follow the fahrenheit reading because both systems are available. They have been available for too long. This is where I break ranks with the hon. Member. I suggest that there should be a time limit for the provision. If we carry it on for too long a period, people will not get down to the necessity of getting used to the new system. We tried a time limit with the coinage and many people have adopted the new system, except old fogies like ourselves. The youngsters have adopted it readily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentlemen were willing to put a time limit on the provision, I could accept the amendment wholeheartedly. I suggest that the period should be fairly short because, as I said, in the case of temperatures, by prolonging the two registers people did not get down to adopting the new system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are delighted that we have had interventions from the Labour benches. There may therefore be some common ground between us. I am sure that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) is right in wanting us to put a time limit in the provision. Otherwise we shall go on using terms such as "acre" and "ton" when we should recognise that we must induce our farmers to think and feel European, and stop thinking and feeling British any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately—here I come back to what I said earlier—our farmers can be a bit cavalier about these different measurements. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary did not like my saying what I did say about farmers and gathering statistics, but many of them have much the same attitude to these metric units. They are not taking the new measures as seriously as they should, although it is in their own interests to do so. Over and over again one hears: "That is no bother, a hectare is two and a half acres, a metre is one yard and a tonne is the same as a ton." If one is doing a quick calculation it is not very important, but when one is concerned with costs and prices it can be. I am afraid that a number of farmers and growers will miscalculate and be worse off as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be sympathetic to what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) on this occasion and by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) on Second Reading. Farmers are unprepared and they are being a little bit happy-go-lucky about the changeover when it may not prove to he in their interests so to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with all its gathering of statistics, yet worked out any idea of the cost of going metric for agriculture? This matter is causing worry to some of our thinking farmers who have been adding up their sums and making a forecast or two as to what it may cost them, and some of them have produced some rather startling figures. They may have miscalculated, and perhaps the Ministry has some information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the cost is to he anything other than marginal, do the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
intend to take it into account in any price review? is there to be any compensation for agriculture? After all, it is not altogether the farmers' wish that we should go over to metrication. It is necessary as a result of our entry into the Common Market. It may be that the majority of farmers voted for it, but they voted for other reasons if they did. Thus, there should be some kind of compensation for them if the cost of metrication is to be as high as some of the forecasts have predicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to limit my remarks to the amendment and not to deal with some of the more general comments that have been made. However, I want to take up the point made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick). I am sympathetic to his philosophy. I appreciate that one will not get people to think differently unless one makes a relatively quick alteration and one starts using metric measurements for everyday life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, however, specifically asks that in Government pronouncements only the alternative conventional units should be used. It is worth bearing in mind that I understand that a considerable number of peasants in Normandy still use the pound weight for their trading purposes, although some 150 years ago Napoleon France changed to the metric system. In practical farming terms, my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) will probably talk about sacks and quarters of different sorts of grain, which mean something to him but nothing to me. In the Midlands I talk about my grain in hundredweights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, whatever we lay down in this House, the individuals on the farms will practise for a good long time to come their own forms of measurement. While I accept the philosophy behind the wish of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor, I hope that in practical terms, and in particular because ignorance of the law is no excuse, we can, if not forever at least for a considerable period, comply with the terms of my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
main source of disagreement was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) a moment or two ago. I too was brought up to think of grain in terms of sacks and quarters. It was most sensible when we got away from the ludicrous situation where a sack of oats was 12 stones, a sack of barley was 16 stones, a sack of wheat was 18 stones and a sack of rye was 20 stones. That was one of the biggest nonsenses we had. Personally, I believe that that has been a good move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, I would go further and say that in terms of quick calculation, office management, bookkeeping, and so on. the move to decimalisation has saved a vast amount of time, certainly in an office and business with which I am connected. The time saved by not having to fool about with shillings and pence is incalculable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. I do not know what my hon. Friend's attitude is to suggestions that have been made—particularly by hon. Gentlemen opposite—to having a time limit built into his amendment. No doubt he will tell his reaction. My own feeling is that it perhaps would be a good thing, and I hope that the Government will respond favourably. If they were to say that they would take the amendment away with a view to bringing it back on Report with a time limit built in, that perhaps would he acceptable to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing I want to say in support of the amendment follows some remarks I made on Second Reading, when I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As I understandd it, farmers are totally unprepared to be told in about two months' time that milk prices will be expressed per litre and that livestock prices will be expressed by kilogramme."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1288.]</p></blockquote>
Following that, I was glad to hear, as we all were, the Parliamentary Secretary tell us that the Government were proposing to do that in terms of the next price review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a letter from the National Farmers' Union, in which a certain amount of dismay was felt at my remarks on Second Reading. It was felt by the NFU—probably justifiably—that
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
I had not sufficiently paid tribute to the excellent work done by the Metrication Board under the chairmanship of my old friend, David Darbishire. I know that it has done a vast amount of work, and it has done its utmost to publicise the coming of metrication to agriculture in every way that it could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is, however, we all tend to be a bit lazy about these matters. Documents arrive through our letter boxes and we say: "This is something we shall have to mug-up when the day comes". I still feel that the farmers themselves for the most part are very much unprepared for the widespread use of metricated units. It is essential that the Government do everything they can to help during the transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say when he replies. If he stays true to form, I am sure that he will meet us, but I am somewhat dismayed to see the presence of the Minister of State. Although we are always glad to see him, when he was away on Tuesday we made excellent progress. The Parliamentary Secretary was as flexible as we have known him. He agreed with our points. He was understanding and helpful. We have made good progress this morning. We have got through a full clause. Therefore, I hope that the return of the Minister of State to the Committee does not mean that the spirit of good will and co-operation which has existed recently will now come to a sudden end. I hope that it does not, and that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to help us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main purpose of the clause is to provide power to substitute metric units for existing imperial measures in a few enactments, as specified in Schedule 3, where the power does not currently exist. There is a large block of legislation in respect of which no new amending power is necessary. None of the enactments—I must stress this—involved in the clause, apart from two marketing schemes, is concerned either with the Annual Review or with main grants or subsidies. I hope that Opposition Members will take that into account when considering whether or not to press this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This exercise will be basically a tidying-up arrangement only. All the activities of the Ministry of Agriculture,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
Fisheries and Food are already being adapted to metric during the current farming year at the specific request of the agricultural industry. I want to emphasise that. We are not imposing metric usage on a reluctant sector, but simply carrying out that sector's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the joint discussions on timing and arrangements generally which have gone on for several years between suppliers and marketing and farmers' organisations, and in which we have taken part, the NFU has repeatedly said that it would be opposed to any rigid system of dual units. Instead, we have agreed with it that flexible arrangements should apply. It is clear that there will be a greater need for them in some areas—for example, pesticides—than in others, and the period involved must vary in different spheres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1976 Annual Review was conducted in metric terms, but the subsequent determinations will be shown additionally in imperial units in the annual review White Paper as a guide to farmers. I am happy to reassure the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) and others on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the time of next year's review everyone should be a good deal more familiar with metric units. We shall then be prepared to consider providing imperial equivalents in the 1977 Annual Review White Paper, but if only to avoid confusion and the problems of conversion, we hope that this will not be necessary. The advisory services will use both metric and imperial units long enough to ensure that farmers fully understand the advice that they are given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will want to consider this very seriously. First, as I pointed out, the clause does not refer to the Annual Review, as implied in the amendment. Secondly, I want to reiterate the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick). My immediate reaction—and it was my reaction on Second Reading, as the hon. Member for Westmorland reminded us—was that in principle it would be desirable to print metric with imperial units for many years. I assure hon. Members that I do not rule that out, and if they want
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
to return to this point on Report I shall be happy to come to it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we should think about the matter nearer the time. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor made the bull point and gave a good example. Many people share his view that giving temperatures in centigrade and fahrenheit in television weather forecasts for such a long time has had the effect of deterring people from beginning to come to terms with the new system. There is no incentive to them to understand centigrade. People need a little bit of a jog, a little bit of encouragement, to think in terms of the new system rather than being encouraged to be lazy. After all—I have been guilty of it myself—when one hears centigrade and fahrenheit quoted it s easy to think in terms of fahrenheit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not ruling out the idea of printing imperial and metric units in the next Review or the one after it. All I am saying is that hon. Members might want to reflect carefully on the extent to which they would want to tie down this or any subsequent Government—it has been pointed out that there is no time limit in the amendment—to constantly repeating in imperial units every time we use metric units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that the same thing would happen as happened with decimal coinage. Some people, particularly older people, still hark back to the old pounds, shillings and pence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like to be included among "older people."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I am not suggesting that it happens exclusively with older people, but there is a tendency for older people to use the word "shillings."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never think in terms of pounds, shillings and pence. I might grudge giving a taxi driver 80p, but I never convert the sum to shillings. As a matter of fact, I do not begrudge giving taxi drivers 80p. There are many people I would begrudge giving money to before I would complain about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a Ministry car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I use taxis a great deal. I use a Ministry car very little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dwelt on the last point because I think it is important, and hon. Members may want to think about it fully before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industries and the agricultural Departments will be using rounded metric units—that is, pounds or pence per litre, per hectare and so on. That is relevant to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West about poaching. As a fellow Scot, I, too, am very concerned about poachers. My hon. Friend has a more particular and long-standing interest in these matters than I have. I know that if it were possible for an hon. Member to serve on two Standing Committees at the same time he would be serving on the Freshwater and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Bill, where the whole question of poaching is very relevant. It may well be that his reference in this Committee to poaching is to some extent a reflection of his frustration at not being able to participate fully on that important piece of Scottish legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to some of the more specific points that have been raised. The imperial equivalents could run to many decimal places, and arc not, therefore, something to be enshrined in legislation, though useful as a temporary guide in some areas for a short period. We have undertaken in subsection (4) to consult those concerned about the precise timing of changes in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) said a good deal about the history and introduction of metrication. It is true that the whole metrication programme started in 1965 and was instituted at the request of industry itself. It has always been a firm principle that costs must lie where they fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members—including the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West—have asked me to estimate the inflationary effect. That is very difficult. They have said that there are bound to be increases arising from the need to modify machines and packaging, but it is difficult to estimate the actual cost involved. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) suggested that even manufacturers and producers would have some difficulty in knowing in advance how much money they would
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
spend specifically to cover the cost of decimalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Metrication Board has made considerable efforts to publicise the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be good enough to give an estimate of the cost—albeit very approximate? We have heard some startling forecasts, and it may be right for the Parliamentary Secretary to put them into proper perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be very incautious for me to give a figure without detailed consideration. My feeling is that we are not really in a position to make an estimate. I undertake to inquire whether any estimates, however tentative, have been made by our officials and to communicate with the hon. Gentleman, but offhand I cannot cite a figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of work has gone into co-ordinating this change. The Metrication Board has published a list of helpful booklets. I hope that hon. Members have seen these booklets but we should be happy to supply them if they have not had an opportunity to look at them. Every organisation involved has free copies of these booklets, as about 80,000 were issued. The farming organisations have tried to ensure that every farmer has seen a copy. The Board has continually publicised the arrangements. It is currently conducting a major campaign in the farming Press. The NFU is also publicising its branches, and the Agriculture Departments will give full publicity to changes in their activities in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope hon. Members will recognise that a very great effort is being made. We shall continue to look at this in the light of the remarks of the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West and others who seemed to suggest that in their areas this information is still not getting through to the grass roots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norfolk. South-West raised queries in relation to slaughterhouses and livestock auction markets, a matter in which he takes a deep interest. The date for the change to metric trading at livestock auction and deadweight markets—January 1977, the first trading day after the end of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
1976—was agreed with the industries and trades concerned, including the National Farmers' Union, in a series of discussions during the summer of 1975. The National Federation of Scale and Weighing Machine Manufacturers was closely involved in these discussions and agreed that it would be quite possible to make the necessary weighing machine conversions in time, provided orders were placed early. The Federation advised that local authorities and traders concerned should get in touch with their weighing machinery suppliers or contractors as soon as possible to arrange for the conversion of their equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Metrication Board has written to appropriate local authorities throughout the United Kingdom advising them of the forthcoming change and of the need to place orders for the conversion of weighing machines. The Board's letter has also been sent to trade associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon. Members that I recognise a degree of sympathy on both sides of the Committee for the amendment. I have explained why it would be inappropriate to refer specifically to the Agricultural Price Review in an amendment, but we will give very serious consideration to whether it would be appropriate to repeat the imperial units in subsequent Price Reviews. My own inclination is that we want to keep our options open. But we shall give this further consideration in the light of what has been said today. There will be an opportunity on Report to return to the matter. I hope I have said sufficient for the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather surprised to find the change of attitude of the Minister from his carefully-considered speech on Second Reading, in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I suspect that hon. Members such as myself will hope that the Government will for many years use both metric and imperial figures in their Annual Reviews."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st December 1975; Vol. 901, 	<i>c.</i> 1347.]</p></blockquote>
That is the purpose of the amendment. I agree with the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) that a time limit should be set to it. I should like to suggest five years. I believe that this is quite different to the question of fahrenheit and centigrade, because the
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
education process will be continuing. Therefore, I am prepared to set a limit to it because people in their day-to-day business will be happy to carry it out in metric units rather than in imperial units. With centigrade and fahrenheit, it is not quite a fair comparison because one may carry an umbrella or mackintosh, take off a waistcoat if one appreciates that it is 70 deg. F, but it does not mean so much to one's business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the Minister's remarks on Second Reading, which must have been carefully considered, I hope that he will not be browbeaten by the Minister of State and by his staff—I am sure that would never happen, but Ministry officials do not like to see any amendments to their cherished Bills. For a few years, I was fairly closely connected with them in Government. But if this were done for five years, it would be sufficient. I emphasise once again that these were the Minister's first thoughts, and first thoughts are best. I feel sure he took great care about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's comparison with fahrenheit and centigrade is not a fair one, and I feel that I must press my Amendment if the Minister cannot assure me that he will see that the metric and the imperial figures are published, as the amendment proposes, for the next five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). He has given the Government every opportunity to meet us. The views expressed by us and by the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) and the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) mean that the Committee is at one. We should express in a vote our belief that it is right to continue, for a five-year period, the provision for the Price Review and other Ministry publications to be expressed in metric units. It is not much to ask. If the Government press on as they wish, I think it will cause immense trouble. I quite understand that the Parliamentary Secretary says that he thinks the Government should reconsider the matter in 1977, but these matters are so much more complicated than fahrenheit and centigrade and will take more time to absorb. Therefore, in view of the Committee's agreement, we should press the Government and express our view,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
which I am certain is widely supported outside. I am sure that the farming industry would, if it were given the chance, support us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will have second thoughts and agree on Report to table an amendment which will specify a five-year period, and that we shall not have to go to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) said, that the comparison of temperature readings and metric measurements is not valid because the process of education will go on and one must actively be doing something about the measurements. This reinforces my argument that the timing should be shorter, because an educational process of this kind will effect a change in a much shorter time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has said sufficient to indicate that the situation is not as bad as I envisaged at the beginning of the debate. But I do not want the door closed at</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to go back to things that I have said on previous occasions, but you may recall, Mr. Costain, that on Second Reading I said that I felt we had a somewhat piecemeal approach to metrication by the Government, and that at the moment we had no clear idea of the overall strategy of the Government to metrication and that many difficulties are arising. As a consequence, I was interested to read a Press release on metrication sent to me by the National Federation of Wholesale Grocers and Provision Merchants. The press release states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The date from which it will no longer be legal to sell items by Imperial Weights is one that can only be dealt with by legislation and manufactur-</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
	<p>this stage. I feel that he should clarity the position further before Report. For instance, if I were to accept the amendment as it stands, there is no time limit, so that I can hardly support it without the full knowledge that we shall stop it at some stage or another. But I want my hon. Friend to come back on Report with something more specific along the lines that he has indicated this morning.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have undertaken to consider this between now and Report. But, for the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) has given, we cannot accept the amendment. At this stage, we cannot give undertakings as to the number of years we shall continue to print these figures. We have gone a long way, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) has acknowledged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 4, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>ers, wholesalers, independent retailers and scale manufacturers, who will be faced with a mammoth conversion problem, are unanimous in asking for cut-off ' dates to be legally imposed as a matter of urgency. The Metrication Board asked for this in their 1974 Report and we believe consumer associations to be of a similar mind in wishing for orderly transition within the shortest possible time. If, at this eleventh hour, the Government fails to fix the programme for transition, progress will inevitably be dictated by the following dates."</p>
	<p>The Federation goes on to suggest a number of dates. For instance, by 31st December 1979 Common Market
	<br><blockquote><p>"requirements will make the use of imperial weights illegal, unless an extension has been granted. Such extensions would only apply to particular cases and must have been agreed prior to 31st August 1976.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>After 21st April 1976 and regardless of progress made in the United Kingdom the Government will no longer have the power to prevent the import of goods in metric packs, and it must be lawful in all Member States to use metric units.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>On 1st January 1978 the requirements of the Weights and Measures (Marking of Goods and Abbreviations of Units) Regulations 1975 must have been implemented. These regulations include the requirement for dual marking."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>That Press release, together with the remarks that I and others have made, demonstrates that the Government are rather lagging behind in giving us some idea of what the overall strategy is with regard to the conversion to metrication.</p>
	<p>12.1 5 p.m.</p>
	<p>We gave the Government a good deal of notice that we should be raising these matters and I hope that thought has been given to what we said before. The National Federation of Wholesale Grocers and Provision Merchants tells us:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that from 18 months to 2 years' notice of a cut-off ' date is necessary and agree with the view, already expressed by other bodies, that the changeover should have been completed by 31st December 1977. In our view an immediate decision is required and we are drawing the attention of Members of Parliament to the urgency of the situation."</p></blockquote>
There is a problem here, and Government have not been as forthcoming as they should have been in telling us where we are going in this matter. Important issues are raised and I do not mean at this stage to say a great deal about them. I hope that tile Minister has been able to do some work on this and that he has been able to consult other Departments concerned. As I understand it, the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection is the principal Department concerned, presumably with the Department of Trade. It would be helpful to us and to the country as a whole if the Minister could give us some idea of the overall strategy.</p>
	<p>As the hon. Gentleman said earlier, it is true to say that industry as a whole has asked for the changeover to metrication. We are aware of that. But at the same time there is an onus on Government to try to guide this matter in an orderly way, otherwise major difficulties are likely to arise. In passing, I should say that major difficulties have arisen already. We have been reminded that many of these conversions are into live decimal places. I know from a business with which I am connected that those of us involved in petrol retailing now have to buy our deliveries from the petrol companies in litres and, at the same time, the sales of petrol and petroleum spirits continue to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
in gallons. That causes serious difficulties in that industry.</p>
	<p>I am sure that in agriculture one could think of many ways in which similar difficulties arise. The Government should try to give us a broad picture of where we are going so that industry can prepare for the changeover in the most orderly possible way.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the proceedings. I have spoken for quite a long time. I was disappointed in the way that the Minister changed his mind from Second Reading. I want to return to the point which the Minister made, that full details of the programme of going metric for the farming community has been given the fullest possible publicity. Can he assure me that local papers are being used, that members of the Metrication Board are getting to the farmers on the ground? I do not believe that they are, and much work still has to be done. I should like some specific examples. These booklets are good, but, like so many other people, farmers are busy people who have a lot of literature coming through the door. I do not believe that they have the time to study these booklets. They want them explained in practical detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can give me a further assurance about the campaign which he says is being carried out. He seemed to be relying on the NFU and other trade bodies to carry out the campaign for the Government, and the Metrication Board was relying upon these leaflets which, good though they are, will not hammer home the information to the average person in agriculture in the way it can be hammered home at meetings when questions can be asked and exact examples can be given which affect the individual in his particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that this campaign is under way at ail. I hope the Minister will not forget that we are already drilling barley in Norfolk. In other words, we are starting our busy time. This work should be done during the winter months. There is little time left now. Once people get out on the land, and the longer evenings come, in particular the people to which this campaign is directed do not have the time to attend lectures and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very shocked when the Minister said that he had no idea what this would cost the industry. Surely it should be the business of some department of the Min-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
istry to give a reasonably accurate costing. He said that his statistics were good. He was proud of the statistical department of his Ministry. So one would have thought that that department could have arrived at a reasonably accurate figure for the cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not even an approximate figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We await the Minister's assurances on those points—further details and assurances that this campaign is going ahead as fast as is humanly possible and is using the media of television and local newspapers—in this instance, far better than national newspapers—and hope that he will give, at any rate on Report, some estimate of the costings, which I am shocked to find are not available now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his speech. It was a helpful and—if I may say so—a gracious speech. The negative vote against it was, I think, rather ungracious. The views that he put forward seemed to me perfectly acceptable in the terms of the aims of hon. Gentlemen opposite. The Opposition showed an unnecessarily doctrinaire and dogmatic rigidity in voting on the matter. We got sufficient assurances from my hon. Friend and I accept them. I am convinced that the best way to make sure that assurances are carried out is for us to co-operate with those assurances and not to try to negative them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Acts to which this clause refers are all exclusively agricultural Acts, and there are no implications for Acts that concern consumer affairs. Perhaps consumer affairs should have been considered at the same time, because there is a clear relationship.

Thirdly, in relation to subsection (4), in considering which organisations, I wondered whether they need not necessarily be exclusively agricultural organisations—the NFU, and so on—but perhaps also some consumer organisations. If we are to start dealing in litres instead of pints, that no doubt will feed its way back into the retail industry sooner or later, and it may be useful for that industry's views to be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, on subsection (3), can the Minister give us any examples that he has in mind? It seems to me a very useful sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>380</span>
section. Indeed, it is another reason why I say that I welcome the Minister's speech, because it appears to tie up the assurances he gave that if difficulties or obscurities occurred they would be covered by the Ministry paying attention. I want the Ministry to pay attention to its own subsection (3), and that in issuing any regulations it is in the forefront of its thinking that they should be expressed in the most " convenient and suitable terms".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am sorry that there is no representative of the Scottish Office here, because there are a number of implications on the fisheries side that should be spelt out and would be valuable for us to understand more clearly in Scotland. I hope that a special effort will be made, with the help of the Scottish Office, to make these matters known, understood and learned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, I accept what has been said by the Minister and shall be keeping an eye open to make sure that the assurances, despite the attitude of certain hon. Members opposite, are carried out in the spirit in which they were given in that speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) for his kind remarks. It is only fair to put on record that two hon. Members opposite had the courage and independence of mind not to seek automatically to support blindly Amendment No. 50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to some of the important points which have been raised in this debate. We have covered a number of matters which concerned the basic objectives of the clause, and which I shall not repeat. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) raised some important points in relation to the overall programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall Government policy on metrication is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection. A statement on general policy was given in this Administration's period of Office oh 25th March and again on 20th May, 1974, when the Secretary of State confirmed that metrication in industry was continuing and that the Government's policy of support for those planning to change, as outlined in the previous Government's White Paper of February 1972, would be maintained. I understand that this White Paper was debated in 1972 and 1973, and that policy was reaffirmed in the House by the Minister of State, Department of Prices of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
Consumer Protection, on 23rd and 27th October 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also draw the attention of the Committee to the statement of the Minister of State, Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, in the House on 11th December. He stated then that legislation would probably be introduced during the current Session to ensure compliance with an EEC directive which requires the United Kingdom generally to adopt the use of metric units by the end of 1979. It is intended that that legislation will allow cut-off dates to be set for all sectors. I am sure that that answers the important point put by the hon. Member for Westmorland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). On the subject of publicity, I said that the Metrication Board is conducting a major campaign in the farming Press. I think hon. Members would recognise that the most important source of information on agricultural matters for the bulk of farmers in this country is the farming Press. Recently I spoke to a very competent advisory officer in Scotland who said that all their surveys had shown that the farming Press was an enormously important source of information to farmers. That is why they were concentrating more and more on writing articles for the farming Press and using the Press as a means of getting metrication across. Some hon. Members who take an interest in these matters must have noticed the well-written and appealingly illustrated article in the 	<i>Farmer & Stockbreeder</i> of 3rd January by Mr. David Darbishire, Chairman of the Joint Metrication Group for Agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the Minister that the farming Press is important and that most farmers read it. Nevertheless, I feel that the local papers can be of immense value, as can certain sessions on television, which I feel brings it home to people more clearly than the written word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already undertaken to consider this point and to see whether further steps can be taken to improve publicity here. I am sure the hon. Member will make his own representations to the NFU, whose campaign he feels has not
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
yet been sufficiently successful in his own area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the question of the cost to the industry. It is difficult, if, indeed, possible, in this or any other industry, to produce a meaningful estimate of the likely total cost of transition to metric, or, indeed, of the cost of neglecting to make this change in a world rapidly going metric. Nor can we assess the value of benefits that will acrue. No country which has made the change has attempted to do an estimate of costs in monetary terms, and there now remain only five small countries which are not either metric or about to make the switch. It is the case that the costs come first and the benefits follow much later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change was wanted by the industry and it is surely right that it should meet the cost. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West asked that the taxpayer should subsidise some of the cost of this transition, a point to which I failed to respond. I find it difficult to sustain constant requests from hon. Members of the Opposition for taxpayers' money for this and that. The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) is smiling. I know that he agrees with me. I know that he and some other hon. Members on the Opposition Benches are consistent on the point that " you can't have your cake and eat it". In my opinion there is no case for arguing that the taxpayers should pay for a change which has been requested by industry, and which is in industry's own interests and will later benefit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West quite rightly raised the matter of fisheries. While he was out of the room, I thanked him for his very kind remarks. It is the case that very little discussion has taken place on the fisheries part of this clause. In passing, I confirm that the reference to the Secretary of State applies to the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it also refer to the Secretary of State for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards fisheries, the purpose of the clause is to obtain an enabling power to permit, where necessary, amendments to existing legislation by simplified procedure. The amendments will show rounded metric units in place of imperial units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful debate on the clause. Predictably, the discussion has ranged fairly wide and dealt with a number
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
of important aspects of the change important to the industry, and it is right and proper that these matters should be heard in the Committee. I trust that the Committee will now be happy to accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 8</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER TO REGULATE EXPORTATION OF ANIMALS IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR WELFARE.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 62, in page 9, line 12, leave out "may" and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall within twelve months of this Act coming into force".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 67, in page 9, line 20, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I can take this quite shortly, and perhaps the Minister can give his view on whether this amendment is satisfactory. I need not canvass the old arguments about the export of cattle. We are only too well aware that while meat prices are cheaper on this side of the Channel than in the rest of the Common Market, there will be a continuing export of live animals. It is a one-way trade which I believe will diminish over the years once our meat prices reach the level of those now existing in the rest of the Community. But while the trade continues there is a view that there should be some regulation of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have concerned ourselves with the export of cattle—I know my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) has taken a great interest—are satisfied, on the whole, that those in this country who are concerned with the trade provide satisfactory arrangements on the ships. The anxiety begins when those cattle are sold in Rotterdam, and begin another journey which may be unregulated and which may take them to far away places, including North Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears, therefore, to be a strong case for the regulation of this trade so long as it continues. I ask the Minister to say whether he shares that view. If so, ought not the word "shall" be inserted rather
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
than "may"? If the Bill retains the word "may", as I understand it the trade may go on unregulated, without any change, indefinitely. That must be unsatisfactory and those engaged in breeding and selling livestock which may eventually be for a foreign market are among the first who would wish to see the trade regulated so that cases of cruelty should not occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to explain one matter. It has been put to me that if this amendment is not accepted some of the existing safeguards will be put in peril, that there might well be fewer safeguards, and fewer controls over the trade and that no regulations will be made. In other words, if the Minister does not act in exercising the powers under Clause 8 to make these provisions then such safeguards as have existed in the past would come to an end. I am not so convinced that that would be the position, but it has been put to me very strongly by people outside the House, and I shall be grateful to have a clear assurance on it. Perhaps the Minister will spell out the precise legal position that would exist if he did not make the regulations that he could make under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 67, although allied, touches on something which, I hope will be plain to the Minister, needs the word "shall" rather than "may". The Amendment proposes that if an order is to be made in due course the Minister "shall" require information
	<br><blockquote><p>"about the intended destination of the animals"</p></blockquote>
to be exported. Surely that is essential. If one does not have that information, one cannot sensibly control this trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as as I am concerned—I think it is also the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West—if animals are to go to Rotterdam and are slaughtered there or within a short radius of Rotterdam, there is much less anxiety about this traffic. But if these animals are to go on many kilometers beyond Rotterdam, far beyond the distance they are supposed to go, there is a very real risk of cruelty. There can be no real doubt about that whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will, therefore, be good enough to accept Amendment No. 67, which will give him the power to find out the destination of the animals when they are exported. Unless he knows to which country they are going, and to which slaughterhouse they are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
going, and thus knows the kind of conditions in which they will he slaughtered, it would seem that any order or provision he makes will have very little effect. On this one occasion, therefore, I am asking the Minister to take upon himself more power than he is asking for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I recall situations in which we have discussed this problem in the past, and I vividly recall the major decision that was made on the export of live animals. It was made on a free vote in the House, and the Conservative Government at the time accepted the decision. That followed a series of investigations, some of them crass, some amateur, and some made by welfare organisations, into a situation about which a great deal of disquiet existed. It is true to say that the committee of inquiry exonerated the trade from many of the wilder charges. It does not follow from that, however, that regulations are not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up this point of "may" and "shall" in this context. Even if the wilder charges are disproved, there comes a time when people require not only information to the effect that it is not happening, but they want fuller security that it will not happen. That was the position we arrived at at the end of that series of discussions. There was no doubt that the vote itself, and the discussions and the Government action in relation to it also helped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also clear that the bulk of the livestock industry and the traders in this country behave with propriety. In the great majority of cases all effort was taken to deal with the kind of points put forward concerning transportation, points of killing, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause says that the Government may bring in regulations more fully to deal with that. Either they are necessary or are not necessary, but I do not believe that the point is proved that they are not necessary merely by evidence that, so far as we can see, most of the traders conducted themselves well. What is lacking is the assurance that it will not go wrong in the future, or that those things which have not been spotted are not talring place. That, of itself, is not a sufficient argument for retaining the word " may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction between "may" and "shall" is sometimes fairly narrow. The Scottish Grand Committee has spent many hours attempting to establish the difference between "may" and shall". The background always is, "Don't ask us to do things that are unnecessary. If they are necessary, then we shall do them." But that is not sufficient for a legislature. The legislature must say that if we all agree that if it happens it is necessary to do it, then the word "shall" becomes an imperative. I think that is what the hon. Gentleman is seeking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good deal of comfort would be given to many people if, by the use of the word "shall" it was known that the legislation necessitated the laying down of regulations. Whether it was in the timescale of the 12 months suggested is another question. Satisfaction would be given to the people who have been concerned with the matter, and that matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows also that if the argument against it is that it is not necessary because it does not happen, then no harm is done. If we say we must have legislation to prevent "X" from happening and the argument is that it is not needed because "X" does not happen, the corollary is that if "X" does not happen, no harm is done by bringing in regulations to ensure that it does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is not a semantic point. It is a logical point, but at least it has the effect of reassuring those concerned with the trade and, at best, it makes it necessary for the Government to take steps which will prevent things going wrong and to clear up things which may be going wrong at the moment but which we do not yet know or have not spotted. Therefore, I think we should accept the word, "shall" here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of information, the hon. Member for Holland with Boston, who, in my opinion, has been right about so many matters in this Committee, is right here, too. I believe in information. I agree that there is an irony in the situation that one or two members of the Conservative Party, which is always so concerned about expense, on this occasion appear to be seeking further expense. But the hon. Member has stood steadfastly on this point all the time. He is willing to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
accept this expense, and I think he is right. Democracy depends upon the dissemination of information among the knowledgeable population, but so also does Government action depend upon information. Even if we were to accept " shall" in the first case and say that we must have "shall" for the reasons I have given, it also follows that we must ensure that that "shall" can be carried out properly, because the maximum knowledge would be available to the Government Department to make sure that that "shall" becomes effective in its practice. It therefore seems to follow that the second "may"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"an order under this section may"—</p></blockquote>
must now be changed to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall include provision for requiring persons proposing to export animals"</p></blockquote>
and the details of the destination, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, one of the big factors which underlay public anxiety was precisely related to the question of destination. There is no separation between the two: the two stand or fall together. Since the first, almost on first principles, stands, that it should be "shall"—an argument of logic, not merely an agricultural argument—then the second should follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in the trade there are honourable gentlemen who behave well—we are all honourable gentlemen—who feel aggrieved by this. They may say, "We do not do anything wrong. We behave according to the spirit of the decisions taken by this House and the statements and regulations made by Government. Why put this further burden on us?" I accept that. It has been the cry of the innocents throughout history. Why should we have to go to the trouble and difficulty of trying to avoid that which we neither seek to avoid nor do avoid? But the innocent, too, must sometimes carry burdens and be inconvenienced if we are to ensure that the guilty do not get away with it. This is the whole basis of modern civilisation and society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may take the example of Belfast where people are searched daily. I am searched every Monday, in case I am carrying bombs on the shuttle 'plane from Glasgow to London, at enormous inconvenience. I carry no bombs from Glasgow to London and I have no intention of doing so, but I submit to
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
this inconvenience to provide that information because it is necessary to seek out the guilty. Therefore, I understand and sympathise with the objections from the industry about the extra inconvenience on the simple argument that we do not intend to offend. This is one of the prices that civilisation must pay to protect the innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the expense need be considerable, but it is a necessary expense. The will of the House was demonstrated in 1973, when the major decision was made. I hope that the Minister will continue in the mood that he has been in today and that he will accept the amendments. My own intention, unless I can be convinced otherwise—my hon. Friend is very persuasive—is to vote for "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe with my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) that if we are to have these regulations they should be brought in within a time limit. It would be a good thing for those who are engaged on this trade to know that this will be settled—unless the Minister can convince me otherwise—within a certain timetable. It would get people down to work both in the Ministry and in the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is as well to have the regulations laid out and discussed with the representative bodies. These items should be included, although I have some doubt about the arrangements for conveying them to their destination, which is one of the items which would be covered under the second "shall" Whether anybody in this country can say whether animals will be conveyed by train or lorry or aeroplane might be difficult once they had reached the other side of the country. One cannot always tell how from the port animals will be conveyed—trains and lorries break down, there are strikes, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I generally support the amendment and will vote for it if necessary unless the Minister can convince me that a timetable will be laid down, though I have doubts about being able to lie down with the arrangements if they include the method by which animals are conveyed on from the port to their final destination, and are set out in the information given by an exporter from this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
I believe that this trade is dwindling, not only because our prices are gradually coming together with prices in the other EEC countries, but also because of the growth of the deadweight export trade. That is a growing business, a very big business which is carried on by certain exporters from the East of England, one of which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston. I support the amendment in general but I should like to know what the Minister has in mind about this matter before I finally make up my mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start from the basis of a belief in a carcase trade. I would much prefer it to be 100 per cent. carcase trade but, like my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), I voted on the export of live animals in different ways. In the first instance, I supported the ban so that we could have time to look at the situation. Later, I supported an export trade on the basis that there were sufficient safeguards to satisfy us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some disquiet soon afterwards that things were not as they appeared to be initially. We must set people's minds at rest. The clause mentions the need for certification. If it is recognised or acknowledged in the Ministry that this provision is needed, there should be no doubt about it—it should be brought in. This is why I support the substitution of "may" by "shall". Let us go ahead with it if there is any reasonable doubt. Personally I cannot understand why people prefer to see animals transported long distances before they slaughter them for eating. The animals must deteriorate considerably. But that is for them to decide. I accept that there may be some difficulties with the time span, but I need convincing on this. I, too, support the
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
amendment unless the Minister can bring us something specific that will assist us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case the Minister feels that everyone on the Committee is standing against him on this matter, I assure him that I for one feel that the Bill as drafted is perfectly adequate. He will be aware that I have taken considerable interest in the export of live animals. Following the first decision of the House of Commons in 1973 to terminate the export of live animals pending the O'Brien Inquiry, I accompanied a consignment of animals from my constituency across the sea to Holland, and to the lairage and ultimately to the slaughterhouse itself. I believe that the O'Brien recommendations exonerated the industry and clearly indicated that the vast majority of people engaged in this trade dealt with animals properly, from the farm on which they were raised right into the slaughter chamber itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The foisting of additional work on those engaged in the trade is unnecessary. The Minister clearly indicated that the system introduced following the O'Brien recommendations provided all the necessary safeguards. I am opposed to compulsion and additional legislation and paperwork, and for that reason I certainly intend to vote with the Government if the Bill as drafted is as the Government wish to see it proceed to the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
