	<time>Tuesday, 10th February, 1976</time>
	<p>[MR. A. P. COSTAIN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>AGRICULTURE (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 9</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER TO PROVIDE FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF WILD LIFE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>—(	<i>5th February</i>)— That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. It may have come to your attention, when reading the newspapers this morning, that the Labour Party has announced its proposals for nationalising agricultural land. This is a matter of such importance to the whole agricultural industry that the consideration of the Bill should be adjourned while the Government prepare their legislation on this matter, which doubtless they will wish to add to the Bill that is before the Committee. Therefore, I wonder whether I am in order in seeking to move the adjournment of the Committee for one month.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Costain. I think all hon. Members on the Government side of the Committee will take great exception to that piece of party polemics. The Labour Party has no policy for the nationalisation of agricultural land. I have not read this morning's capitalist Press, but I have not the slightest doubt that there will be at least one newspaper that is running some story which it believes will be damaging to the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am on the Agricultural Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs Committee; and the Labour Party considers a wide range of matters. However, this is a piece of party polemics, Mr. Costain, and I hope that you will treat it with the contempt that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The business of this Committee is to proceed with the Committee stage of this Bill. I do not think that this is the right moment to raise the matter. The hon. Gentleman has other opportunities when in the Chamber, and I think it would be better if the matter were raised there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that same point of order, Mr. Costain. While not in any way wishing to differ with your ruling, may I ask how you can say that this particular announcement in the newspapers today about the policy of the Home Affairs Committee of the Labour Party has no bearing on this Bill? I believe that it has every bearing on this Bill, certainly in relation to the new clause which the Minister himself indicated the Government would be tabling in place of the new clause which he asked his back benchers to withdraw from the Amendment Paper. I believe that it has an extremely important effect upon the Bill. Therefore, Mr. Costain, I hope that you will, as the Chairman of this Committee, ask the Minister to come to this Committee at an early date and make a statement on the policy that has been announced in the Press today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Costain. I think that there are important matters here, principally matters of confidence within the industry. The Parliamentary Secretary has accused my colleagues of polemics, and he used various other words. His reference to this morning's" capitalist Press" seems to me to stink rather more of Moscow than of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that this story will have caused a good deal of disquiet throughout the whole of the agricultural industry. If this story is, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, sheer rubbish, I am sure that hon. Members on the Conservative side of the Committee would be prepared to accept that. If it is rubbish, I am sure that he will accept that the story will have caused a great deal of concern and dismay. Can he then give us an assurance that a statement will be issued by his Department or by Transport House to the effect that the story is rubbish? If the Minister would be good enough to do that, it would help us to proceed and it would resolve the matter very quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry if the Parliamentary Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
intends to say absolutely nothing on this matter. I think, Mr. Costain, that a question of this sort deserves an answer of some description from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must get this clear. I have no power as Chairman of this Committee to send for Ministers or to make Ministers say things that they do not intend to say. I realise the importance of such an announcement in the Press, but if every Committee of the House had to adjourn because its members had read an announcement in the Press we should get into rather deep water. I suggest to hon. Members that they have made their point. The job of the Committee is to deal with the Bill. There may be other opportunities to go into the question, possibly on Business Questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. This is not just any announcement. This is an announcement of fundamental importance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the Government party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>—by the Government party, indeed, and it is not merely a Committee of the Labour Party but a strong representation of that very committee of influential Members of the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me is that we may be wasting our time, to put the matter in its best context, in further proceedings on the Bill. In its worst context, the issue is more sinister. But be that as it may, I do not want to waste my time, and I look for serious guidance in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Member's point, but we are considering the Committee stage of a Bill. We are now considering a specific clause which does not relate to the hon. Gentleman's comment in any shape or form. I suggest that, if every time we read a newspaper in which an announcement is made, we have to adjourn a Committee, that would be quite unreasonable. I do not under-estimate the seriousness of the announcement about the agricultural industry, but this is not the time or place to bring up the matter. We really must get on with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Costain, raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). You have
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
made your position clear that you think it would be wrong for us to ask for an adjournment of the Committee on the matter. If you feel that it would be wrong to ask for an adjournment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—at this point, that does not, I think, preclude us from pressing the Parliamentary Secretary to do what we have already asked him to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I observed, and I think that probably my hon. Friend noticed it, that the Parliamentary Secretary was on the point of rising to his feet until the Minister of State actually spoke to him. I have no idea what words passed between them, but it was perfectly clear that the Parliamentary Secretary was about to rise. I should have thought that in half a minute he could have set our minds at rest by saying that a statement will be issued to the effect that the story in this morning's newspaper is rubbish, as the hon. Gentleman told us it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to reply on Clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may supplement what my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said, we are first asked to adjourn the Committee for the purpose of considering some report in a newspaper which I admit I have not seen, and I doubt that many hon. Members have. I therefore have no idea what it is about. The suggestion to adjourn is on the grounds that this story is of great importance to the confidence of the industry and will have an effect on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in respect of any report from outside the House, whether true or untrue, which makes any difference to the proceedings which are before the Committee today. There are no proposals for nationalisation, if that is what is suggested. I have no idea what the matter is all about, but there was no such proposal in the Gracious Speech or in the Labour Party manifesto. if any Committee, as you said, Mr. Contain, were to adjourn to consider matters which may or may not be in the Press, whether true or untrue, then I submit that the Committees of the House of Commons would make no progress whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the ingenuity of Conservative hon. Members, if that is the correct term to use, in bringing this red
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
herring, if I may call it so, into an agricultural debate. But I am quite sure that you, Mr. Costain, will advise the Committee that there are many other ways in which hon. Members may raise the matter which they want to raise here on the Floor of the House. I hope, therefore, that Members having made their point effectively the Committee will proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must make progress. I shall not take any more points of order on the matter. We are having the" Clause 9, as amended, stand part" debate. Mr. Strang.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a motion before the Committee, Mr. Costain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Costain. I am glad that we may now resume the serious discussions of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Committee adjourned last week, the" Clause 9, as amended, stand part" debate had covered, in addition to the general topics of the clause, a number of specific matters. I should like to reply to some of those points now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) asked me what instances we foresaw in the future in which the powers conferred in the clause might have to be invoked. At the moment I am glad to say we do not see any known case for the use of these powers except in relation to the problem of tuberculosis and badgers, but there are plenty of examples in other parts of the world of the sort of problems that could arise. New Zealand has a problem with opossums and tuberculosis, which is very similar in many ways to our own problem with badgers, and I could give other examples from other countries, if hon. Members are interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all hope that, once we have cleared up the problem of tuberculosis in badgers, these powers will remain dormant for a long time, but we need them, because we cannot be sure that this will be the case. There are plenty of examples in other countries which indicate that it is prudent to take these general powers so that we have them, if needed, in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point, raised by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling),
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
concerned the power to make provision for the use of illegal methods of destruction. The hon. Member expressed the hope that this would not mean we were contemplating the use of a method such as a gin trap. Certainly it was not the gin trap that was in our minds when this provision was included in the Bill. We were thinking more of certain poisons which are prohibited for use by the general public, but which might be the only practicable way of doing what has to be done in a particular situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of hydrogen cyanide gas against badgers is an example of this. Hon. Members will notice that the subsection requires the Minister, in making use of these powers, to pay particular regard to the need to avoid unnecessary suffering in the wild species concerned. Clearly our first thought in all cases would be to carry out the necessary work of destruction by methods which were already legal, but the power in subsection (5) enables us to use other methods if it is preferable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point, raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), was the need to remove the source of infection of the wild species. This is absolutely right, since there can be little point in taking action against a wild species if that species is continually being reinfected from another source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But our whole approach to the problem with which this clause and Clause 10 are concerned is that we should make a two-pronged attack on the disease, under the ordinary Diseases of Animals Act powers in relation to farm species and under these powers in relation to wild species. Indeed, the case for this clause rests on the assumption that it is possible to prevent further spread of the disease from farm livestock to wild species by action under the Diseases of Animals Act. If the circumstances were such that the disease in the farm species could not be contained, on the face of it there would be no case for taking action against the wild species.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that with these explanations of the points raised the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<div class='title'>POWERS OF ENTRY ETC. IN CONNECTION WITH SECTION 9</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 91, in page 12, line 4, leave out ' appropriate authority ' and insert ' Minister or of the Secretary of State'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 92, in page 12, line 7, leave out ' appropriate authority ' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'Minister or the Secretary of State'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a tidying up amendment designed to ensure that officers of both the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland are authorised officers for the purposes of Clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be occasions when a disease for which I am the responsible Minister has to be dealt with in Scotland. As the subsection is worded, an officer of the Department would not be an authorised officer in relation to such action. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that this is a position no one would wish to see and that the Committee will approve this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is purely for my own enlightenment in these matters, and one endeavours to accumulate experience over the years, but it is far from clear to me why "appropriate authority" does not embrace the Minister or the Secretary of State. We had indications previously, when the Minister was repulsing amendments from this side of the Committee, that such phrases as "relevant bodies" have been found to be very inconvenient because they are far too embracing. Rightly, one would like to know why "appropriate authority" does not include the Minister and his colleague the Secretary of State for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical, clearing-up amendment. The problem is that in all the previous legislation there have been occasions when reference has been only to the Minister. We want to make it absolutely clear that in regard to this Bill the appropriate authority is not just the Minister but the Secretary of State for Scotland. As I have indicated, the officers of both the Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland would be deemed as
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
appropriate officers for enforcing this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 92, in page 12, line 7, leave out" appropriate authority" and insert:

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 40, in page 12, line 12, after "may", insert "at all reasonable hours".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 42, in page 12, line 22, leave out "at any time" and insert "at all reasonable hours".</p>
	<p>No. 43, in page 12, line 41, after "may", insert "at all reasonable hours".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have in the course of our debates used the word" reasonable" on numerous occasions. Unfortunately, on too many of those occasions the reasonableness shown by this side of the Committee, has not been heeded by the Government side, and therefore reason has not predominated. I hope that on this occasion these humble, and I think purposeful but reasonable, amendments will be accepted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In presenting the case to the Committee this morning I hope that I can indicate by other pieces of legislation that the words set out in the Amendment Paper should be inserted in the Bill at this stage of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under various public health measures—I refer particularly to the Public Health Act 1936, Section 287—any authorised officer of a council has a right to enter any premises" at all reasonable hours" and, as I intend to indicate later in our debate, after 24 hours' notice to the occupier, for the various purposes which permit him to enter a home, property or premises for purposes under the Public Health Act 1936.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise with rating, the valuation officer, and any person authorised by him in writing, has power "at all reasonable times", again after giving 24 hours' notice in writing, to enter, survey and value any property in the area for which the valuation officer lets, for the purpose of drawing, up valuation lists, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
Here in two ways I have clearly indicated to the Committee that in other pieces of parliamentary legislation which now rest on the statute book, and which have been in being for a considerable time, the words "at reasonable times" are included. For this reason we suggest that in the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill the words" at all reasonable hours" should be inserted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give further evidence to the Committee. Under the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, Sections 280 and 281, any person authorised by the Minister of Housing or by the Local Planning Authority may enter premises at reasonable hours for various planning purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could, if it were in order, which I believe it would not be in this Committee, give the reasons why any person authorised could enter a house relating to planning purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Act 1957, Sections 159 and 160, and the Housing Act 1969, Section 61, again clearly lay down that any person authorised by the local authority or the Minister may enter any house "at all reasonable times", for various purposes under the Housing Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, one could refer to the Electric Lighting Acts of 1882 and 1909, and the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these pieces of legislation, now Acts of Parliament on the statute book, clearly lay down that officers acting for an authority or for the Government may enter property, but at reasonable times or at reasonable hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 34 to 37 of Schedule 3 of the Gas Act 1948 clearly lay down where gas is concerned that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any officer authorised by an Area Board may at all reasonable times on the production of a duly authenticated document … enter any premises in which there is a service pipe connected with the gas mains of the Board, in order to inspect the meters",</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have, therefore, indicated that there are numerous pieces of legislation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend inform me what would happen if there was a gas leakage and an explosion was imminent? Would supply come to a stop and the situation build up overnight? I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, indeed. I have personal experience of the matter that my
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
hon. Friend has just raised, having had a tragic and serious explosion in my constituency which resulted in the death of an elderly person. Where there is a gas leak it is inevitable that the home owner or occupier—the person concerned in a house or in an area—would have reported it to the authority in the first instance and, therefore, the officials acting on behalf of the gas authority would have the right to enter the property, because it would have been given the right by the people concerned, and endeavour to locate and put the leak right.

I come now to water undertakings. There are a variety of circumstances in which a duly authorised officer of the water supply undertakers may enter premises—again I use this phrase— "at reasonable hours". All through legislation passed by the House of Commons the words" at reasonable hours" or" at a reasonable time" are repeated time and time again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where pests are concerned, a person authorised in writing by a local authority or by a person empowered by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to exercise functions of a local authority—that is, under Section 22 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949—may enter premises" at any reasonable time" to carry out inspections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see, time and time again, the words—for a good purpose, I believe—" at reasonable times" included in legislation. Not wishing in any way to cast aspersions. upon the Parliamentary Secretary, this power is contained in the Mental Health Act 1959, Sections 22 and 130. Section 22 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A mental welfare officer of a local health authority may, at all reasonable times, … enter and inspect any premises … in the area … in which a mentally disordered patient is living"</p></blockquote>
and the explanation goes further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have indicated to the Parliamentary Secretary with the examples which I have quoted from legislation, some of which, by the way, have been passed by Labour Governments and not all by past Conservative Governments, that these words are necessary and would improve the Bill. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be receptive to the reasoned argument that I have put forward. If he so wishes, he may take me up on some of the legislation that I have quoted, but I believe that we have good cause for putting the amendment forward and I hope that it will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whilst I am with my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) entirely in spirit, I do have doubts about the placing of the amendment and its drafting. "Reasonable hours" could be interpreted as being reasonable to the species themselves, let alone to the occupier or whatever, in the way that it is drafted. However, I am sure that we shall not split hairs about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What conditions my approach is that actions under the clause are to be taken under the umbrella of the provisions in Clause 9. Therefore, I refer back to Clause 9(7), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before commencing the destruction of the wild members of a species on any land within an area to which an order under this section applies the appropriate authority shall take all reasonable steps to inform the occupier of the land and any other person who may be there of the authority's intention to carry out that destruction and of the methods of destruction to be used" —</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We deliberated the provisions of Clause 9 at some length. I hope that you will not rule me out of order, Mr. Costain, but I believe there is a direct relationship there. My impression was that the Parliamentary Secretary gave an undertaking that between now and Report there are certain aspects of Clause 9 that he might be prepared to reconsider. I should have thought that in the context of this amendment he might deal with this by giving an undertaking that he is prepared to reconsider the wording and provisions of Clause 9 (7).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the appropriate authority shall take all reasonable steps to inform the occupier of the land and any other person who may be there of the authority's intention to carry out that destruction and of the methods of destruction to be used."</p></blockquote>
Some reference might also be made, in so far as it is convenient or can be foreseen, to the likely hours of process of intrusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be difficult to be specific in the legislation, but I should have thought that a form of words may be found which would appease my hon. Friend, because obviously his aim is to cause the appropriate authority, the veterinary inspector or
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person who, not being an officer or inspector, is authorised"</p></blockquote>
to act reasonably—it is quite clearly stipulated that the authorised officer has to have reasonable grounds—but also not
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
to act factiously: not to turn up at odd or inconvenient hours, make himself awkward and not permit of reasonable responses from the occupier. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary fully comprehends these suggestions and the whole intonation of what my hon. Friend has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the wording itself is somewhat defective, in so far as the objective and subject of the phrase or clause is not immediately apparent to dual interpretation. I prefer to rest on some strengthening or enlargement of subsection (7) in the preceding umbrella Clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed in the remarks made by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). It seems to suggest that, notwithstanding the considerable amount of time I spent explaining to hon. Members the importance of this measure, he does not yet fully grasp the practicalities of what we are about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it absolutely clear that the examples which the hon. Gentleman cited of other Acts of Parliament, which included the phrase" reasonable hours" or something similar, were quite inappropriate. Subsection (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this section shall authorise any person to enter a dwellinghouse"</p></blockquote>
The public health legislation and the other Acts which the hon. Gentleman cited refer to powers of entry which in a court can apply to dwellinghouses. That is why it is wrong to seek to compare the safeguards in these Acts of Parliament with what would be appropriate in this instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has rested his case. Presumably he puts forward his arguments in terms of their descending order of merit or strength. That is a good argument. Perhaps I am pre-empting what he is going to say, but I should have thought that a more important argument is that the powers referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) are in terms of latent hazards, if I may put it that way, whereas we are here dealing with a situation where the gas is escaping, an order has been made in that area, and there is an identifiable and proven hazard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can be drawn too far on the general question of leaks this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point which the hon. Member raised. I am not always in the habit of putting my arguments in descending order of strength, but I thought it important to make that point at the outset, because—and I do not mean this unkindly—the hon. Member for Macclesfield had overlooked the basic difference between the Acts he was citing and what is envisaged in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendments would be to restrict acess to the land by authorised officers to carry out not only investigations into the possible existence of disease but the subsequent operations to eradicate disease and the final checks to ensure that the operations had been satisfactorily completed. Access for any of those purposes would be permitted only during "reasonable hours".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to introduce a vague phrase. It is certainly one which is open to at least dual interpretation. as the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) pointed out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minister consider it such a vague phrase, if it has been incorporated in so much legislation now on the Statute Book? As my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, it is not that we wish to draw the matter of gas leaks into the Bill, but there is a much more dire emergency if a gas leak has occurred rather than if animals are diseased. Why is it considered vital for officers of the Ministry to enter private property or private premises at any time—even in the middle of the night—when it can be done at any reasonable hour for gas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase is vague in the context of the Bill, because it is ambiguous. One must ask "Reasonable to whom?" We could be talking about a nocturnal species. The amendment is utterly impractical. Indeed, it is worse than that. It could have the serious effect of inhibiting any reasonable operations in meeting the objectives of the clauses. If hon. Members accept the purpose and intent behind the clauses, they cannot in all conscience pursue the amendments. Secondly, we must remember that disease spread does not occur only
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
During reasonable hours. To limit the activities of authorised officers only to certain times of the day and perhaps only to certain days of the week could seriously delay the success of those activities and greatly extend not only the cost of the work but also the inconvenience suffered by all concerned. Such limitation certainly will not be to the advantage of the wildlife species or to farm livestock or even to man himself, if the disease is one which is dangerous to human beings. I do not want to say this again, but let us remember that we could be talking about very serious diseases, such as a strain of foot-and-mouth disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorised officers will naturally take all possible steps to ensure that the work they must undertake will cause as little inconvenience as possible to the occupier of the land and to any other person on the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further point which I omitted to make earlier. I take the point of the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge that I have given an undertaking in relation to Clause 9 about giving notice to the occupiers, to see whether it would be practical to write in such a limitation to ensure that it would not put a constraint on the Ministry which might have an adverse overall effect. Therefore, I accept his point that, in the context of that clause, it will be appropriate to look at this. Certainly I could not do something which made it impossible for officers to handle these matters if necessary at other than normal daytime hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his remarks. I would be prepared to settle in that context for an assurance in due course regarding the format of the notice, not necessarily in the Bill. There could well be a paragraph warning occupiers that, whilst all efforts will be taken to co-operate, it might well be necessary to make visits at certain times and they should be prepared accordingly, or something to that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard that as a very constructive suggestion, and I shall certainly take it on board. It will be a way of meeting the point raised by the hon. Member and by his hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield without
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
actually having the rigidity and the danger in the law of officers being pre-vented from doing something which probably everyone in this situation will want done. I hope that the hon. Member for Macclesfield will withdraw his amendment in the light of my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I am relatively reassured by the Minister's last few words. However, I want to make one or two further points. The hon. Gentleman talked about the lack of specificity of the phrase "at all reasonable hours".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fair enough. The word "reasonable", however, not only features in the Bill but also featured in the Diseases of Animals Act 1950, Section 73(2) of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An inspector may at any time enter any land or shed to which this Act applies, or other building or place wherein he has reasonable grounds for supposing".</p></blockquote>
Virtually the same words, if not exactly, exist here in subsection (2), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting".</p></blockquote>
In refusing to accept the amendments, the Minister is being somewhat unsympathetic to the relationship which exists in virtually every case between the Ministry, farmers, landowners, National Farmers' Union, Country Landowners' Association and so on. Therefore, I again refer to the words uttered by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) that co-operation and reasonableness are the hallmark of success in work on the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is being a little inflexible in refusing the amendments, which would give certain safeguards. We all know that to farmers "reasonable hours" are virtually 20 hours out of 24 in the day, but the farmer would at least have the benefit of not being awakened unnecessarily at two o'clock in the morning by a particularly over-zealous Ministry official saying that he has a suspicion that some of the farmer's cattle, or badgers in a set on his land, are suffering from tuberculosis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the Minister's comment, not only on my own contribution but on the very pertinent points raised by my hon. Friend the Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton), I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 41, in page 12, line 12, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after procurement of a magistrate's order, and after due notice to the occupier".</p></blockquote>
I hope that I do not bore the Committee if I find it necessary to cover some of the ground that I have already gone over. I know that the Minister was somewhat unhelpful and, if anything, a little critical of my mention of the Public Health Acts, particularly the Public Health Act 1936, Section 287(2) of which states that if
	<br><blockquote><p>"admission to any premises has been refused"—</p></blockquote>
and I agree that that is premises rather than land, but to me it comes to one and the same thing—
	<br><blockquote><p>or that refusal is apprehended, or that the premises are unoccupied or the occupier is temporarily absent, or that the case is one of urgency, or that an application for admission would defeat the object of the entry"</p></blockquote>
and that in each case
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is reasonable ground for entry into the premises"</p></blockquote>
a justice may grant a warrant authorising entry, by force if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to safeguard the interests of all those who own land. In this country there are laws to protect the individual and private property, and although all Opposition Members wish to see diseased animals removed so that the disease does not spread, as that could be costly to the country and in the long term affect our food production, I believe that simple words such as those in the 1936 Public Health Act, which have been included in many Acts on the Statute Book, would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Parliamentary Secretary will give considerable thought to the purpose behind the amendment. A justice of the peace has at common law the power, on information being sworn before him alleging a suspicion that larceny has been committed, to issue a search warrant. If the matter is particularly urgent there is no reason why the Ministry or a Ministry official should not make a case to a magistrate, asking for a warrant to be issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
Civil remedy in common law is part of the jurisdiction of this country. In this connection I refer the Minister to Halsbury's Laws of England, and mention, too, William Leigh's book Police Powers in England and Wales (1975). The latter book, which is right up-to-date, indicates some of the safeguards that exist for a private citizen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends might say that this is by way of a probing amendment. Perhaps it is. At the same time I believe that the Draconian powers contained in the Bill go further than The Diseases of Animals Act 1950.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People require the safeguards of the law, which is why the Opposition have put down the amendment, which would nut those who wish to carry out a particular activity into the position of having to justify it if they are refused access to land, by putting a case to a magistrate and obtaining a warrant. I do not believe that the provision would cause delay. Like Members of Parliament, magistrates are available at all times of the day and night. The Minister of State, who is a magistrate, is well aware of that, so perhaps he would tell his hon. Friend that the proposal would not cause undue delay, but certainly would mean that the officials of the Ministry would have to justify their case for demanding access to land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has said. I believe that my thoughts about the need for a magistrate's order will be crystallised when I have heard the Minister's reply, but I feel strongly about the second half of the amendment. In the clause we have the opportunity to press the case. We had a debate on a similar matter on the previous amendment, but it was on a broader issue and it was not quite so easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (2) we are dealing with the case in which an authorised officer only suspects that there might exist among wild species a disease about which we are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, this is a less urgent situation than when the Minister knows that the disease actually exists, and at that moment one obviously has to do what is to be done as quickly as possible. We can appreciate this. When, however, one
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
merely suspects, I cannot agree that there need be quite so much urgency about entering premises as in the case which we debated principally on Clause 9, where the destruction of a species has to be carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am concerned about is the situation where there might well be proof, in a certain holding or a certain field, and tracks might lead off into adjacent fields or properties, which then are merely suspicion but are based on well-founded evidence, and should be pursued forthwith. That is the kind of situation that confronts me in considering this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand my hon. Friend's concern about that. I did not know that he had the skill of a Red Indian tracker, that he could follow badger tracks in anything but snow across fields, particularly grass fields—T do not know quite how he does that, but that would be a case where there was a good deal more certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would, however, suggest to my hon. Friend that cases where one could follow tracks of animals of this sort would be very rare indeed. I concern myself principally with the majority of the cases which might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the Minister to be saddled with a very long, impossible and intolerable delay when these cases of suspicion arise. I hope I am taking my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) with me. None of us wants intolerable delays, but at the same time I think we are all agreed that occupiers of land have rights and interests which are worthy of our consideration. I hope. therefore that the Minister in particular will accept the second half of this amendment. I shall listen very carefully to what he says about the magistrate's order, but it is over the second part that I am insistent. As my hon. Friend said in an extreme case where there was evidence that the suspicion was very firm, we ought to insist that the inspector should at least go and knock on the door and try to find someone who occupies the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something that I am most concerned about, seeing people trailing about land. I know on my own land I have sometimes found people walking up the river-bank on my own farm,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
and have gone to ask them what they—whether I could help them or what they were there for, and one finds—and one has found perhaps that it was a river inspector, who was perfectly entitled to he there. Of course, I can understand with river land it is a different matter. All I am trying to say is that it causes a good deal of disquiet to occupiers of land, when they are going about their farms, to find all sorts of people wandering about upon them. All I want is that, when cases of this sort arise, the Ministry's employee, vet, or whoever it is, should make some effort to contact the occupier of the land, or somebody who is associated with it, to say what he intends to do, so that it is known what is happening. I believe that there is not the urgency here that we have discussed before, and I believe that this type of provision ought to be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment proposes that, whenever an authorised officer intends to enter land to investigate the suspected existence of disease in wildlife, he must first obtain a magistrate's order. Officials have been investigating suspected disease in farm livestock for many decades and it has never been a statutory requirement that they should first obtain a magistrate's order. I do not consider that the investigation of disease in wildlife is so different from the investigation of disease in farm livestock that the imposition of such a requirement is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether the suspicion of the existence of disease needs to be investigated is hardly one that a magistrate is competent to decide. It is a matter for an expert in diseases of farm livestock to decide and this can best be done only by official experts. It would be quite wrong to place decisions of this kind in the hands of lay magistrates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the existence of disease on land is suspected, it is hardly likely that the occupier of the land will be unaware of the problem. In fact, the initial report will probably have been made by him and it will seem intolerable to him that investigation of his report must be delayed until a magistrate's order is obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
It is not customary for officials to enter land without first attempting to contact the occupier. I emphasise that. I remind the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) that I have already this morning referred to the assurance that I gave in relation to Clause 9, which meets the basic point he is arguing—namely, that we should try to go further to give proper notice to the occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought the hon. Gentleman gave the game away when he was referring to his own land. He said that whenever he saw someone on his land he went bounding over to see "what they", and then he stopped—we can all guess what he was going to say—and then he said that he asked whether he could help them. I suspect that it was what the lion. Gentleman stopped short of saying which illustrates more than anything the difference between the landowner's attitude to land, and the enjoyment of land and the environment by all the people of this country, and our attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) is a very reasonable man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can all argue about the meaning of" reasonable" in the context of landowners. There is, of course, no question that officials will make every effort to contact the person whose land it is. They would, of course, say whether they wish to take any samples on that land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is inconceivable that urgent operations to investigate a serious disease risk should have to be held up in order that the occupier, who might even be absent abroad on holiday, should have to be given due notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to repeat that officials will be prepared to take all necessary and practicable steps to ensure that the occupier of land is aware of the intention to enter the land to investigate the suspected existence of disease in wildlife. Bearing in mind the assurance that I have given in regard to Clause 9, I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the general good will which has permeated what the Parliamentary Secretary has had to say about the endeavour to make contact with the landowner or occupier, but let

	<span class='label label-info column'>509</span>
us suppose that this fails. Let us suppose that the investigating official falls down a disused pit-shaft or an old well—and this is by no means extraordinary to come across—which he could have avoided had he made contact with the occupier. He may well have been guided in a different direction. Is it quite clear that in any circumstances—I repeat," in any circumstances" —the authorised official is on that land at entirely his own or the Minister's risk and that there is no contingent liability in this regard whatsoever for any injury that could devolve upon the owner or the occupier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman such an assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where to begin. One still senses the Under-Secretary's hostility towards these amendments, which we believe would merely safeguard the interests of all those involved on the land—particularly, I agree, the landowner. I endeavoured, when I introduced the amendment, not to cover all the ground I had covered earlier this morning, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) pointed out, I repeat that perhaps the most important part of Amendment No. 41 is the last pact, which reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"and after due notice to the occupier"</p></blockquote>
I entirely support the Minister's point that often, where disease has broken out amongst a wild species, it might well be the landowner or the farmer who has reported this to the Ministry, but I believe that certain safeguards about access to land by Government officials should be written into this legislation. I again remind the Committee of certain public health legislation. I used the quotation from various Acts which talked about access at all reasonable times and at all reasonable hours. All this legislation goes on to say, in the main—
	<br><blockquote><p>"twenty-four hours' notice…to the occupier".</p></blockquote>
That is the Public Health Act 1936, Section 287. Again, where rating is concerned, any authorised person has power, after giving 24 hours' notice in writing, to enter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any difficulty in the Ministry officials actually giving this notice to the occupier. I entirely agree that it might on occasions be difficult to
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>
locate the owner, or even the occupier, of the land, but surely in that case the simple reference of the matter and its importance to a local magistrate, such as the Minister of State himself is, would secure a warrant which would immediately be available and allow the Ministry officials to have immediate access to the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on about planning. Again, a person authorised to enter premises must give 24 hours' notice to the occupier. In the Housing Act 1957 and the Housing Act 1969 we find the same requirement, that the person making the entry should be authorised in writing and 24 hours' notice should be given. Again, under various Water Acts, exactly the same provision is included, that 24 hours' notice must be given, or should have been given, to the occupier. This is what I would describe as, it forms the last part of the amendment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and after due notice to the occupier".</p></blockquote>
Every member of this Committee wants to ensure that disease amongst wildlife is not spread to domestic animals or farm animals thereby causing loss and ultimate problems over the production of food, but the safeguards which we wish to see written into the legislation would in no way inhibit the activity of Ministry officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the stance that the Parliamentary Secretary takes on so many issues, I am sure that he would himself expect people to receive due notice Therefore, what is the harm of having these words written into the legislation? Likewise, where there are problems in tracing the owner or the occupier of land or property, again what is the difficulty of making an immediate approach to a magistrate or a justice of the peace to obtain a warrant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view and in that of my hon. Friends, the amendments provide certain safeguards which, I repeat. would in no way inhibit the speed or the ability of the Ministry to act where diseased wildlife species are concerned and which could only improve this legislation and provide certain safeguards for individuals whose land was occupied or might be occupied by diseased species of wildlife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure you, Mr. Costain, that the Government's philosophy does not tempt me, but their encouraging noises about wishing to hear me launch forth into a long debate on the word "necessary" tempts me to do just that. However, I shall refrain from so doing and shall resist the temptation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a drafting amendment. I hope that in his reply the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate that he is prepared to accept the amendment, and for once will agree with one of the amendments that I am propounding. It would merely ensure that subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"carry out any other investigations necessary for the purpose of determining".</p></blockquote>
This would make the paragraph much more specific, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be responsive to this brief but, I hope, explicit promotion of our case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to turn down Amendment No. 106, so ably moved by my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
it is superfluous. Although on the whole I prefer not to indulge in superfluities, I should have thought that it would add some clarification and emphasis in this instance, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not feel himself inhibited and will acquiesce to the amendment in the spirit in which it has been moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we understand it, the amendment adds no substance to the clause. The advice that I have received is that it is unnecessary. In order to be as reasonable as the Government Front Bench have been throughout the proceedings of the Bill, I undertake to look at the matter again to see whether there is anything to be gained from it. I know that hon. Members will agree that there are experts on these matters and, if the experts indicate that there is the slightest, teeny bit of difference made to the clause by the incorporation of this word and it is practical, we shall certainly accept it on Report. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will allow us to move speedily on to the next amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted. I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is intended to make it clear that when an authorised officer has investigated the suspected existence of disease in a species of wildlife in an area and it is considered necessary to make an order under Clause 9 to require the slaughter of members of that species, the order could specify either the whole or only a part of the area in which the investigations have been carried out. In effect, therefore, it gives the appropriate Minister the discretion to declare by order an area which is smaller than the area which has been investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly desirable that Ministers should have this discretion and I am sure that it will be welcomed by the conservation interests. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will agree that this amendment should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ment to the clause as it stands. It may be from the ordinary layman's point of view an extremely simple if trivial amendment, but we on this side of the Committee believe that it is important. As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it will be greatly welcomed by the conservation interests throughout Britain. Therefore I am happy to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 94, in page 12, line 30, leave out "whether destruction of the" and insert "as regards any".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is also designed to ensure that we would not over kill. As the subsection stands at present, the authorised officer will need to satisfy himself that all members of the species of wild life specified in the order have been destroyed in the area concerned. We obviously do not wish to do this unless it is absolutely necessary. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will agree to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, there is a broad welcome from this side of the Committee for the amendment, which will be welcomed by the conservation organisations and interests in Britain.

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 95, in page 12, line 31, after "relates" insert ",whether destruction".—[	<i>Mr. Strang.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 96, in page 12, line 34, leave out first "the".—[	<i>Mr. Strang.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 97, in page 13, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) Without prejudice to subsection (6) above, an authorised officer—
	<ol>
	<li>shall not demand admission as of right to any land forming part of a nature reserve within the meaning of section 15 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949) maintained or managed by the Nature Conservancy Council under section 1 of the Nature Conservancy Council Act 1973 unless seven days' notice of the intended entry has been given to the Council; and</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
	<li>in exercising any of his powers under subsection (2), (3) or (4) above on any such land, shall as far as possible, do so in accordance with such reasonable requirements for minimising damage to flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features within the reserve as may have been notified by the Council to the Minister or, in Scotland, the Secretary of State."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment demonstrates the desire of the Government to make it clear that, in addition to the statutory obligation upon the appropriate Minister to consult the Nature Conservancy Council before an order is made under Clause 9 should the area concerned include a statutory nature reserve, there will be collaboration with the Nature Conservancy Council before an authorised officer enters the reserve whether before or after an order has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment places two distinct obligations upon the authorised officer. First, he must give seven days' notice of his intended entry to the reserve. In practice, however, it is expected that, apart from a reserve in a remote area where there may not always be a resident warden, it will not be necessary for the full period of notice to elapse before mutual arrangements for entry are arranged. I would go further and say that, where it was necessary, it would be imperative that no delay was caused to the Ministry if it was an urgent matter before mutual arrangements were tied up with the Nature Conservancy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the authorised officer must take all possible steps to minimise damage to any special features within the reserve to which attention has been drawn by the Nature Conservancy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will agree that this amendment goes a very long way indeed towards ensuring that everything possible is done to safeguard the very special conservation features that exist within a statutory nature reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has the full agreement of the Nature Conservancy Council, which has a statutory responsibility for nature reserves, and I am sure that all conservation interests will accept that it represents a genuine desire on the part of the Government to make it clear that, if the statutory provisions of Clauses 9 and 10 have to be invoked when a serious disease situation exists that involves a nature reserve, all possible precautions will nevertheless be taken to protect
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
conservation aspects. I hope therefore that the Committee will accept this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I can say right away that we are in broad agreement with the amendment, which is necessary and which will be very much welcomed not only by the Nature Conservancy Council but, I believe, by other animal welfare and conservation societies and interests as well. This is something we talked about earlier in our debates, particularly on the previous clause. Notwithstanding the remarks made by the Government at our last sitting, we welcome the content of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I find it a little strange that, where the Government can make this provisions for nature reserves, whether they be located in far-flung corners of the United Kingdom or perhaps are more readily accessible, this proposal cannot be extended to the ordinary landowner or farmer on whose land rare species of wildlife may well be located. In fact, it is probably true to say that there are more species of wildlife on private property up and down the country, north, south, east and west, than there are in national parks or on nature and wildlife reserves. Perhaps it is establishing double standards, one rule for one type of person or organisation, and another, harsher rule for the remainder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothwithstanding those somewhat critical comments, it would be wrong of me not to extend the thanks of this side of the Committee to the Government for this amendment, which we welcome and which improves the legislation we are now debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not, although I am tempted to do so, go over all the arguments that I have deployed this morning, because that would be unnecessary. We have at considerable length and with some difficulty wrung certain assurances from the Parliamentary Secretary as regards the clause as it stands and we look forward to Report to see what improvements the Government have made and how far they have moved to meet some of the points which we have raised during the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
With reference particularly to the obtaining of a magistrate's order, I have gone to some trouble to approach farmers, the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners' Association and various animal welfare and wildlife interests. It is the view of the National Farmers' Union, to some degree shared by the Government, that the need to obtain an order from a magistrate before entering land to investigate may delay important action on behalf of the Ministry. But it goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is unlikely that the magistrates will, in the event, refuse any application".</p></blockquote>
This was very much part of the argument that I put forward earlier in this debate, that the obtaining of a magistrate's order builds certain safeguards into the legislation. Bearing in mind the Draconian and far-reaching powers granted under this legislation, I believe that wildlife interests and ordinary private landowners should have certain safeguards built into the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However—again I am paraphrasing the attitude of the National Farmers' Union to the amendments which we have put down—it is more reasonable to expect that some attempt should be made to notify the occupier of the intention to enter the land, even though the period of the notice may be very short. I remind the Minister and hon. Members opposite that the normal period for due notice which we consider satisfactory is about 24 hours. This is embodied in much of the legislation to which I have referred this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other organisations have clearly indicated to us that they think it is right to restrict entry to reasonable hours. In so many of the letters that I have received the organisations go on to say "And we hope that this will be accepted by the Government". The Government have not accepted the amendments that we have put down, but they have indicated that they will look at this clause and Clause 9 between now and Report and try to meet some of the points which we on this side of the Committee have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of those who have written to us also indicate that they favour the requirement to obtain a magistrate's order, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) argued very well from his own experience, the number
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
of persons who can walk on to private land nowadays under some Act or other is enormous and is steadily growing. As a result, the rights of the individual and of those owning private property are being eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for these reasons that we have given this morning that we have tabled the amendments on the Amendment Paper. Although they have not been heeded so far by the Government, I hope that between now and Report the Under-Secretary will amend the legislation which we are now debating in order to meet the points we have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often difficult to know who are trespassers and who have authority. On the other hand, I know some farmers who are worried, naturally, as the Government are and we all are in this Committee, about infected badgers and who would not want the eradication of infected wild creatures to be unduly hampered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of notice that should be given is around 24 hours, although we have received suggestions from interested organisations that there should be much longer notice. In the case of the Nature Conservancy Council in the last amendment moved by the Government, the Government have clearly stated that they will give seven days' notice. All I can say is that in the arguments that we deployed earlier in this debate we did not ask for seven days, not even ask for five days, four days or three days. The maximum we have suggested is 48 hours, and more often than not it has been as little as 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have endeavoured to be constructive in this debate and to understand the position of the Ministry officials and the need to eradicate diseased wildlife species so that they do not infect other wildlife species or even agricultural and domestic animals. At the same time, however, we have a duty to the landowner, to the farmer, to the tenant farmer and to all those who work on the land. I can only express the hope that the amendments that will be tabled by the Government between now and Report will meet some of the constructive and useful points that we have raised on this side of the Committee during this short debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point which has occurred to me is a matter of detail about which I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary. Before I move to that, I should like to say that there is not much
264695
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
one can add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has said. He has shown the Committee that, over these two Clauses 9 and 10, he has made a very close study. We have all been very impressed by the knowledge and the homework that he has demonstrated in the way that these two clauses have been fully debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I listened to the debate this morning, a certain difficulty that could arise occurred to me. It relates to a new agricultural development which the Parliamentary Secretary, coming from Scotland, may know a little about—namely, the growing interest in deer farming. I say this because I have taken quite an interest in this lately, principally because Dr. Fletcher, who has been getting a good deal of publicity recently, is a cousin of mine. He has been writing to me about some of the problems with which he has been confronted in connection with this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of deer farming—I apologise for raising the topic now; it might have been simpler had I been able to do so earlier, but it has only just occurred to me it occurs to me that here we have a species which basically is wild. I suppose that the highest percentage of deer in the British Isles is wild. But there is a growing interest in the capacity of deer to convert rough feeding stuffs with a high fibre content into protein, and therefore growth, to an astonishingly high degree. It occurs to me, too, that as a species there is no good reason why deer should not be a carrier of such diseases as tuberculosis. I do not know whether that is so, but, as deer become more domesticated and used more as the subject of a livestock-producing technique, the species could become more prone to disease. That could cause difficulties. Thus we have the deer species, basically wild, which may be growing increasingly in conditions of what I might loosely call captivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deer farming today—I have seen it in New Zealand—seems to he pursued almost entirely within an enormously high wire fence. I have seen photographs of Dr. Fletcher looking after his deer and they seem just as tame as cattle. I have seen photographs of them running towards the feeding troughs at feeding time. Therefore, it seems to be not impossible that techniques might be adopted in the future which might allow deer to run free in an unenclosed area part of the time, part of the time returning to the area where they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
knew they would be fed, or even to be herded to the feeding place in the same way as sheep. I suggest that such a method could raise considerable difficulties because Clauses 9 and 10 refer only to wild species. We might be faced with the problem—when is a species wild and when is it domesticated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the matter is irrelevant to those considerations. At first sight it would not seem to be. But if the Parliamentary Secretary would care to comment on the difficulties that might arise over species which in general are wild but which are becoming more domesticated and prone to farming techniques, I suggest that it would be helpful in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to reply to specific matters raised. The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) rehearsed arguments in respect of magistrates, and I can do no more than reiterate the assurance which I gave on Clause 9 about seeking to be helpful in respect of giving notice to occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) that his remarks about deer touch on an interesting agricultural development. It may be something which will develop substantially and it would not be our intention to put any obstacles in the way of that. On the contrary, it is a development that we want to encourage. It is the case that deer can contract tuberculosis, but to our knowledge they do not constitute a problem at present, and are certainly not a threat to farm livestock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member need have no fear, because the legislation enables us to discriminate between deer in captivity, which would be regarded as comparable to other domestic species, and genuine wild deer. In fact, deer held in captivity cannot be destroyed under Clauses 9 and 10, but they could be the subject of eradication measures under the Diseases of Animals Act 1950. Wild deer, however, could be dealt with appropriately under the Clauses 9 and 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the hon. Gentleman's main point has been met, namely, that the legislation enables us to discriminate clearly between deer which are being farmed and those running wild which constitute a menace to farm livestock. I hope that the hon. Member will agree that
	<span class='label label-info column'>520</span>
it is unlikely that action would have to be taken in respect of deer. There is a tendency for serious outbreaks of disease to be brought in from overseas. This tends to happen where the feeding of swill takes place, namely, in the more densely populated parts of the country and areas which are more intensely farmed. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman's comment was relevant and I assure him that there will be no problem in respect of that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 is complementary to Clause 9 and I do not need to go over again the basic case for it. The people who will actually carry out the work will normally be the Ministry's pest control officers who will be under the supervision of senior officers. Hon. Members have indicated that basically they support the purpose of the clauses, and I therefore commend Clause 10 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. At the beginning of our proceedings today I raised with you the possibility of adjourning the Committee as a result of the Labour Party's announcement of a proposal to nationalise farm land. At that time you ruled, if I understood you correctly, that the clause which we were debating then was not relevant to any such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are coming to Clauses 11 to 14, all of which are directly to do with landholding legislation and landlord and tenant matters. I do not wish to argue the merits of those four clauses, but I put it to you that this statement, which I have here and which no doubt you have seen, amounts to a substantial change in Labour Party philosophy. As the Labour Party forms the Government today, it is reasonable for the Opposition to argue that we should adjourn the Committee to enable the Government to make a firm statement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
of their intentions on the nationalising of agricultural land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This document, which I understand emanated from the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) within the Labour Party Home Policy Committee, proposes that there should be a national landlord who would have the powers of existing landlords and to whom the legislation we are considering would undoubtedly refer. It would appear that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has not himself made a firm statement on the matter. and my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) very reasonably asked that we should have a statement if the Committee were to proceed. In the circumstances I feel that I have no alternative but to move the adjournment of the Committee for four weeks so that the matter may be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, I beg to move, That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot accept such a motion. It is not even the subject of a point of order. I have no power to force the Minister to make a statement. However, for the record, Clause 11 gives the Minister powers to enable him to do work to be modified on arbitration. Even if the statement proved to be correct, I cannot see that it would have any bearing on this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask for your guidance, Mr. Costain? Is it not in order for us to move the adjournment of the Committee if we can produce a number of substantial reasons for such a motion? From the statement which comes from the body which constitutionally is responsible for formulating official Labour Party policy, the proposal of nationalisation of the land flows, and would therefore extend the principle upon which we touched earlier today—1 drew the Minister's attention to it when he was present—that he was a substantial landlord already. I gave reasons why he was not a particularly good landlord—in fact, some might say that he was a bad landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for adjourning the Committee to enable the Minister to come forward and say whether the proposal advanced by the National Executive of the Labour Party has his support. It is central to the theme of some of the clauses that we are about to discuss, including the new
	<span class='label label-info column'>522</span>
clause which the Minister is to table. During the past few weeks we have tried to speed things along; our foot has been on the accelerator and we have been making great progress. We wish to continue with this progress by making short speeches to a central point. We thought it right to allow the discussion of the new clause to be reached fairly soon so that we can discuss it sensibly and fully. We shall be in real difficulty if we do not have sufficient time clearly to understand what are the Government's intentions about the future nationalisation of the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must point out that there has not been a Government announcement. We have seen reference in the newspapers today. But, as I pointed out earlier, I cannot accept a point of order arising on an article in a newspaper which may or may not be true. Had it been a Government announcement on the Floor of the House, there would have been an opportunity for action to be taken. However, I have no power to accept a motion on such evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Costain. As I understand it, what is being put to you is a motion that you should allow the adjournment of the Committee, and you in your own judgment, which we support, are resisting that motion. It is my understanding, therefore, that it is out of order to discuss the detail of the case, but one can discuss the question whether you will allow the adjournment to be made. That being so, you have given your ruling and I think that the Committee is now in danger of getting on to quite improper ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not got it right. I have no power to move the adjournment of this Committee.

Members that they have their remedy in the Chamber. Mr. Speaker has greater powers than I have. I cannot accept any further debate on this matter.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It has not been proposed. I have not put the question to the Committee. Does the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed, Mr. Costain, what I am sure is accepted practice that when a point of order is raised by any member of the Committee one gives way. Perhaps I should not have done so without your firmer instruction. I was in the middle of moving this amendment and if I may I should like to make one or two short points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of our discussion on this clause must come on" clause stand part". I accept straight away that the amendments that are tabled in the names of my hon. Friends and myself are legal points of, perhaps, individual importance, but relatively not of any great total significance. Certainly it would be the intention of the Opposition to smile upon Clause 11 in principle. I hope that the Government will reciprocate my good wishes on some of these detailed matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the majority of farms are beginning to deteriorate before the service of a notice to do work, it is important to settle all questions arising from the notice at the preliminary stage—namely, where a tenant wishes to contest a notice, to hold an arbitration to settle all matters. The amendment is not intended in any way to limit the tenant's rights except as to the time he exercises those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union thinks that it may not be necessary to repeat in paragraph (	<i>aa</i>) the express reference to Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) of the 1948 Act, but this is a matter for the draftsmen. I have no doubt that, if the draftsmen are advising the Minister, as they always are, they prefer their own drafting to any amendments that I might table. This would be well precedented. However, this is not an unreasonable point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1964 there are two possible situations where an arbitration can be held. The first is where a landlord serves a notice to do work. A tenant can challenge any matter under that notice. No such right, however, exists for the tenant on a notice which does not involve an obligation to do work, namely, a notice to remedy. The right to challenge a notice to do work was introduced by the Agriculture (Notices to Remedy, and Notices to Quit) Order 1974 (SI 1974 No. 706). That is an order which has caused considerable uncertainty and which we believe should be subject to review after the enactment of Clause II and, possibly, Clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
The object of my amendment is to remove the uncertainty so that the arbitrator under the proposed Clause 11 is enabled to settle all matters which are contained in the notice, whether it is a notice to do work or a notice to remedy. The amendment is not intended to limit the tenant's right to challenge the content of a notice, but to ensure that an arbitrator has power to deal with all matters at this stage. To this extent only will the tenant's rights be limited. We are convinced that it is essentially in the interests of fairness that this amendment be enacted, and I hope that the Minister may take a similar view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made it clear that the purpose of the amendment is to make it a requirement that all questions arising from a notice to do work should be dealt with on the arbitration of the notice to do work. But its effect would be to render the preamble to paragraph (	<i>aa</i>) in lines 21 to 24 difficult to interpret. The amendment would have been better had it been composed as a sub-paragraph standing on its own; and with permission I will discuss it as though it had been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the amendment has little or nothing to do with the avoidance of harassment-1 think the hon. Member himself implied that in his speech—but to alter the procedures for notices to do work. The proposition is that the tenant should be required to raise all matters concerning the notice at the arbitration on the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises difficulties. The best way to illustrate these is to give one obvious example of the sort of difficulty which would arise—the question of whether sufficient time has been allowed in order to make the necessary improvements. There are two parts to any consideration of timing: first, the question of whether the time allowed in the notice is reasonable for the work to be done; and, second whether, in the light of subsequent events—this is very important—it has been possible for the tenant to carry out the work in the time specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first can be considered by the arbitrator as the law stands. His powers to do so are set out in Article 6 of the Agriculture (Notice to Remedy and Notice to Quit) Order 1964. If the tenant successfully contends that the landlord has allowed insufficient time in his notice,
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
the notice is not valid and will be determined accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. Could you ask the Minister to read a little more slowly? This is very complicated and very hard to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly I shall. I will just indicate to the hon. Member for Westonsuper-Mare the point I am driving at—and I would like to pursue it in a little more detail. At the stage of the arbitrator's first looking at the notice to quit, he can obviously make certain amendments, and under our proposition here he will be able to delete certain requirements. But it would be quite wrong for him to have to decide there and then, and finally, what would be an appropriate time for these improvements to be made. It seems sensible, and only fair to the tenant, to enable him in the light of certain circumstances, which could be unforeseen and beyond his control. to come back at a later date and say" I am sorry, but in the event" and he would explain why—" it has not been possible for me to carry out these improvements within the three months, or six months, which you gave me".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, therefore, the tenant successfully contends that the landlord has allowed insufficient time in his notice, the notice is not valid and will be determined accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question can be determined only at the notice to quit stage, when the tenant can plead that because of factors beyond his control—for example, because he has been ill, or a contractor has failed to deliver materials on time—he has been unable to complete the work in the specified time. In such a case the arbitrator may decide to extend the time, but it would not have been possible for him to do so at the first arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other similar reasons that can be advanced which prevent all matters from being determined at the first arbitration. Further, there is the wider point that, as drafted, the amendment could be interpreted as giving an arbitrator complete discretion to determine the effectiveness of the notice to do work in all respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the suggestion that the notice to remedy should be referred to arbitration at the first stage, I can only say that this Bill is not intended as a vehicle for general amendment to the Agricultural Holdings
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
Act. There is good reason why a notice to do work should be referred to arbitration. Time and money are involved, and it is right that disputes should be determined before time and money are spent, not afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The breaches to which a notice to remedy applies are of a different order from breaches to which a notice to do work applies. The most usual are failure to pay rent and failure to live in the farmhouse. There is not the same need for these to be referred to arbitration, therefore, and I have had no such request from either side of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore do not consider that the amendment, even if it had been drafted in a technically effective way, should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two major points. The Minister's statement that it is not the intention of the Government to make major alterations to the Agricultural Holdings Act seems to run precisely counter to his right hon. Friend's statement of last week. We would entirely agree that this is not a vehicle for a major alteration to the law. Indeed, it was for this reason, we understand, that the Government wish to bring in this small alteration. Under the new clause which the Government propose to table, however, we are entering a world where a major revision of this law is to be made, such as in the opinion of some of us will destroy the whole structure of the landlord-tenant relationship in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not seek to make further party points about that, but the hon. Gentleman is likely to be reminded again of his statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the arbitrator's discretion, I confess now, and will probably do so repeatedly during the course of the debates on these clauses, that I am no lawyer. I had, however, understood that to a considerable degree the purpose of Clause 11 was to give the arbitrator much more personal judgment, where he can use his common and professional sense to modify and to allow the progress of modern agriculture to be taken into account when determining notices to remedy or to quit. I was, therefore, rather surprised when the Parliamentary Secretary said in his reply that that was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
the case and that he did not wish in this amendment to give the arbitrator a greater power of discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the other points about the precise drafting of the amendment and I am sure that he, too, would be prepared to say that the principle of time is vitally important. Equally, we must seek in these arbitrations to see fair play to both sides as best we can. I am concerned that in a notice to remedy no consideration is given to time at the first stage. It seems reasonable that a time limit should be imposed and equally reasonable that at a second, or later stage, it should be argued that the time limit was unreasonable or that there were special circumstances why it could not be complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that if one asks somebody to do something and one does not say" by such-and-such a date", whatever one has in mind is always pushed on and on, and one never gets back what one has asked for. It therefore seems reasonable to have some time limits in the first instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no intention of pressing the amendment to a vote, but I would have thought that, in the spirit in which I proposed it, the Parliamentary Secretary would have been a little more sympathetic to the points that I made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend. Like him. when we get on to clauses such as this, I begin to regret that I have not had the advantages of a legal training. It was extremely difficult to follow the complicated brief which the Minister read out on this point. One returns, therefore, to one's own assessment of what this means in commonsense terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood that the whole principle of this--that is why we support what the Government are trying to do in these clauses—was that more discretion, not less, should be given to the arbitrator. This makes sense to me as an ordinary person, because if we are to use this system, the maximum discretion that can be given is obviously a good thing, and it enables the hard cases which would otherwise make bad law and which I understand were the cause of these clauses being put down in the first place to be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not, therefore, follow the Parliamentary Secretary when he said that, as a result of what is proposed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
here, there will be too much discretion on the question of time. Surely, if the cases that he mentioned came about, it would be open to the arbitrator to say that in those circumstances there should be more time. I should be grateful if we could have a little slower elucidation of this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. There are some fairly technical parts of this legislation, but I had not regarded this as one of them. I thought it was a fairly simple point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the hon. Member's amendment, the arbitrator would be required at the first point of contract between him and the tenant to decide, there and then, what the actual notice to work should remain as. In other words, if the time given to do the work was six months, the arbitrator would there and then decide finally whether the six months is adequate. At present the farmer goes back and says," I am sorry. Although six months seemed reasonable at the time, it has not been possible to get the work done", the arbitrator can then say" All right, I think you have made a reasonable justification for it. We will give you another three months or another six months." Under this amendment, far from the arbitrator having more discretion, as the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) seems to think, he would have less. For this reason, we resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 is for clarification and deals with those claims which were mentioned on Second Reading, where the list of items requiring attention is inordinately long. I am led to understand that, although at law the present wording of the Bill covers the point, it is felt that arbitrators should be given rather clearer guidance enabling them to settle the total number of items for which it would be reasonable to make the tenant liable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that to some extent this is a drafting point, but in the course of our debates I think we should put ourselves in the position of an arbitrator, sitting in some cold and draughty place, usually a pub, I gather, debating with the two parties present the finer points of someone's livelihood. One must be as legalistic as possible in the instructions that are given to the arbitrator. It is true that arbitrators are almost never lawyers, although I believe that lawyers can be arbitrators. Frequently they are land agents and others. In the course of our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
debates no doubt the Minister will have comments on the whole question of arbitrators. Amendment No. 75 should be of help in trying to be more specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union, which, as we know, takes a very friendly view of these amendments, acknowledges that this is a matter of drafting. Therefore, there is no great political issue at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 57 is suggested in order to lay down stricter criteria for the arbitrator for modifying lawful notices to do work, and to give him better guidance. The present criteria seem vague. The reference to" sound estate management" is insufficient to protect the landlord's interests, especially where the tenancy agreement contains a requirement designed to maintain the character of a locality or to protect amenity. Further, the landlord's own obligations can be affected by deleting items from the notice to remedy as the scheme of the Agriculture (Maintenance, Repair and Insurance of Fixed Equipment) Regulations 1948 and 1973 is to have a sharing of repairs and maintenance between the landlord and tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that both sides will be equally affected if we do not try to tighten up this phraseology. There is another amendment attached to this to further the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a point on which the Minister must inevitably be guided by his legal advisers, but it is clear that those who have to administer these matters—I include the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors—think it is important that the wording should be tightened up in order to be more specific. The long list of items which may face a tenant can be no longer meaningful in the context of the present rules of good estate management and good husbandry. It is on this point that I suspect the Government have introduced this clause. When we come to debate" clause stand part" the general principle will be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 56—
	<br><blockquote><p>"leave out first or 'and insert' and '"—</p></blockquote>
is almost as familiar to hon. Members as "for may ' read shall'", I suspect. In this case it has an important meaning. If a single arbitrator is to be given the power of releasing a tenant from obligations he undertook in his contract of tenancy, the least requirement should be that the arbitrator should be satisfied
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
that the performance is unnecessary and unjustified. Something that is not strictly necessary may still be justified. For example, it may not be necessary to stop a leak in a roof of, say, an animal shelter or a pig hut, but the requirement to do so may be justified. Again, while I accept that it is a drafting point, it is one on which, the Government will accept, some considerable unhappiness might be saved in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to Amendment No. 60. No guidance or criteria are provided for the arbitrator exercising powers under subparagraph (	<i>ii</i>). It is left entirely to his own whim. Perhaps that is right and should be allowed, as to some extent one is arguing that arbitrators should have greater freedom, but it is suggested that the same criteria should apply to sub-paragraph (	<i>ii</i>) as to sub-paragraph (	<i>i</i>), including those specified in the proposed amendments as tabled. For example, thatch may be specified for roof repairs in order to maintain the character of a village. As at present worded, the arbitrator is given no clue what he is to take into consideration in deciding whether to change a thatching obligation. He does not even have to be satisfied that the method or materials specified are unnecessary or unjustified, as in subparagraph (	<i>i</i>), before modifying it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It sounds elaborate, but in practice it is quite straightforward. In deciding whether a roof shall be thatched, what considerations should the arbitrator have to take into account? Here again an element of common sense must be applied, but using some of the traditional materials, of which thatch is certainly one, tenants can be faced with quite irrational expenses, or, which is as bad, landlords can find that what has been held to be a very expensive contribution to the environment can be ruined by one barn or one building being repaired in what appears to the eye as a foreign material. Sadly, one has seen this happen so often that it appears to be a fair point to make in this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have not failed to deal with any one of the amendments that are grouped together. The principle right across the board is the same. I think the National Farmers' Union would take the view that it is satisfied with the general drafting of the clause, on the grounds that it wants the arbitrator to have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
wide discretion when deciding what should be done. As with so many things, there are swings and roundabouts. We often have to decide in the House whether we should be specific and bind judges, arbitrators and those who have to dispense justice more closely, or less closely. I think the general philosophy behind the clause is that they should be bound less closely. But how much less closely does an arbitrator wish to be bound?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not had the privilege of sitting on a bench of justices or of having had to adjudicate legally anywhere, but I can sympathise with those who have to do so. It is easier for them if there is some restriction, if they know the parameters within which they have to arbitrate. For these reasons I have tabled these amendments, and I hope that the Minister, even if he does not accept them in detail, will at least accept them in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of fair points and I think the best way to deal with them is to go through the amendments individually, though I think it would make sense to take Amendments No. 75 and 76 together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the arbitrator's new powers will be equally applicable to each item in the notice, these amendments are not really necessary. Coming to the main purpose of the amendment, some of the complaints of harassment that came to us contained allegations of unreasonably long lists of work being attached to notices to do work. There were also complaints of the unreasonableness of some of the items which they contained. The amendment is intended to allow an arbitrator to shorten a list if he considers it to be unreasonably long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can well understand the feelings of a tenant when he receives such a list, and to that exent I sympathise with the amendment. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that through his tenancy agreement a tenant has a legal liability to keep his holding in a reasonable state of maintenance and repair. There is no intention on our part to suggest that he should be allowed to avoid his obligations provided that they are necessary or justified. We have tackled the problem in another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Using both his old and new powers
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
an arbitrator will delete from the list any items challenged by the tenant in his counter-notice which the arbitrator considers are not the tenant's legal liability or which are unnecessary or unjustified in the interests of good husbandry or sound estate management. Also he will substitute a different method of work or material for any challenged items if he considers this to be justified in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point to understand is that the arbitrator will have all the powers he needs to delete items from the list on the grounds that they are not necessary for the proper maintenance of the farm. Secondly—this is equally important—where the list is nevertheless fairly substantial he will be able to give as much time as he deems appropriate to have the work done, and the tenant at a subsequent stage will be able to come back and say" I still need more time".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will agree that it is no part of our purpose to make it easier for tenants to avoid carrying out legiti- mate improvements which they have an obligation to do under their tenancy agreement. Therefore, I feel that there is no justification for giving this additional power to shorten the list without reference to the items contained in it. The tenant will be given plenty of time to carry out these improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The substance of what the hon. Gentleman seeks is more than granted already, by giving this very important power to an arbitrator to delete a requirement placed on a tenant by a landlord, on the grounds that it is not necessary or not justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning now to Amendment No. 57, in exercising his new powers the arbitrator must consider whether the item, or the method or material to be used, is unnecessary or unjustified having due regard to the interests of good husbandry and of sound estate management. These criteria have been drawn widely intentionally so as to include the matters set out in the amendment. There may be items in a notice which the tenant contests as being unnecessary or unjustified, but they should not be deleted or amended because of the special requirements of the landlord for conservation or the appearance of the landscape. They are factors which the arbitrator will take into account under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
the existing wording of the clause when reaching his decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally speaking, arbitrators in landlord and tenant disputes are professional men of high standing, fully competent to exercise the discretion which Clause 11 will give them. I think the hon. Member will probably be happy to accept that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that the present powers of arbitration extend to amenity and protection of the environment? Do I understand him to say that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that the words in the clause are such as to enable the arbitrator to take these matters into account in reaching his overall judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue this, because that indeed transcends the essential nature of the lease and the duties of the arbitrator 	<i>vis-àvis</i> the tenant in these matters. It is an important and entirely new fact. I should like to have a clearer definition of it. To what extent would the arbitrator be circumscribed by amenity protection of the environment—such matters as strategy plans developed by county councils, or town and country planning Acts which are numerous and of a wide variety? I think this is a difficult area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are saying that the arbitrator will exercise common sense in this manner. We all know what we are getting at here; we are creating a situation where it will become impossible for the landlord to impose unreasonable requirements on the tenant on the basis of a tenancy agreement in order to evict him from his farm eventually.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair summary. That is implicit in the whole arbitration process here. I do not want to dwell on this, but the problem was that the law as it stands does not give them that discretion, and we are seeking to give it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the specific points raised by Amendment No. 56, which is aimed at giving the arbitrator powers of discretion which he is currently lacking in respect of the reasonableness of items specified in a notice to do work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present an arbitrator is empowered only to apply to them the simple test of whether they are the tenant's legal liability. However frivolous or unnecessary an item may be, the tenant's failure to carry it out can lead to a notice to quit the holding. If the tenant is not to be put to needless worry and expense, it is essential for such items to be set aside at the earliest possible stage—that is, arbitration on the notice to do work. It is in the context of the requirements of good husbandry or sound estate management that the arbitrator will consider whether an item is unnecessary or unjustified. As drafted paragraph (	<i>aa</i>)(	<i>i</i>) will enable the arbitrator to delete an item which is frivolous or insignificant, and he will also be able to delete an item which, for example, may be necessary in the long-term but is not justified in the short-term. In other words unnecessary or unjustified are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
deliberately alternative tests, as indeed are the good husbandry or sound estate management tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, on the other hand, would restrict unduly the arbitrator's discretion by requiring both tests to be met in full. I would say—and I regard this as a rather important point—that it could lead to endless argument over semantics and would defeat the prime objective, which I hope is the objective of the whole Committee, of protecting the tenant from unreasonable actions by the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as Amendment No. 60 is concerned, the purpose of Clause 11(ii) is to allow an arbitrator to use a certain amount of professional discretion. We know that some tenants are required by the notice to do work to use unnecessarily expensive materials or to adopt a method of husbandry—for example, cut and lay a hedge—which, although it may be specified in the tenancy agreement, is no longer practised in the district and for which expert labour is either not available or is obtained only with great difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise to a certain extent with this amendment and with the argument that the arbitrator ought to be given some criteria on which to base his decision to amend an item in a notice to do work. This is already given in subparagraph (	<i>i</i>) as regards the powers to delete items from the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, what better criterion can there possibly be for deciding whether an item is unnecessarily expensive, whether there is a suitable alternative and cheaper materials, or whether an alternative more commonly used method of work exists than the overall criterion of common sense? I am advised by experienced arbitrators that they see no difficulty in applying this provision. They will have heard the arguments of the tenants and the counter-arguments of the landlord on either or both matters, and it is clearly within the professional competence of an arbitrator to make the necessary decisions required by the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I can understand the hon. Member's thinking here. If he wants to press the amendment, we should be prepared to consider it again on Report, but I think he probably will agree with me that this is an instance when on balance we are right to leave
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
this discretion to the arbitrator to take this decision on the basis of common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of this wide group of amendments, I should like to concentrate on Amendment No. 60, which I think is the most important. I was struck by the Parliamentary Secretary's indication that he might be prepared to look at the lack of criteria in the new insertion (	<i>ii</i>) again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I press the hon. Gentleman so to do, because many jobs can be completed with hardboard, where some other substance might be preferable, despite the fact that certain grades of hardboard can get one through three or four seasons. We have to have criteria, as we have in (i). My doubts are further compounded by the word" or" in line 32, as this leaves one in some doubt as to whether (	<i>ii</i>) is in any sense and alternative to (	<i>i</i>) and a 	<i>non sequitur</i> thereof. If that were a possible interpretation, it underlines the desirability of looking again seriously at the content of Amendment No. 60.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be convenient if I were to comment on Amendment No. 60 again. The tone of the Minister's reply was at least favourable to having another look at this. I notice that the National Farmers' Union notes with which I have been provided start off by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would not in principle object to the importation of the basic criteria referred to above to Clause 11(	<i>aa</i>)(	<i>ii</i>), but would question whether the arbitrator should be limited to consideration of those criteria in looking at the suitability of repair materials and methods".</p></blockquote>
In other words, even those who are very much in favour of this would still not be against another look at that point under Amendment No. 60. I hope that my hon. Friend would not feel obliged to press it this morning, but perhaps the Government will look at this before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar point comes up under Amendment No. 57. Again I am not wholly convinced by the Minister's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an argument that might well be put forward. Under the basic criteria of the agricultural holdings legislation—that is, good husbandry and sound estate management—to take into account such matters as environmental considerations would run counter to the whole philosophy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
of legislation. Had he used that argument, I should have had some sympathy for it, but he took the view that the amendment was not necessary because the arbitrator would already take into account environmental considerations. So I am left not knowing quite what to do. The Minister and I do not appear to be far apart, but others outside may disagree with both of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will look again at that point. I would be happy if the words" of the landlord" were deleted, because on re-reflection perhaps the phrase puts a different bias on the amendment from that which we intended, and certainly" amenity" and" environment" were the two items we intended to emphasise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that, when drafting the amendment, I might have taken the view that there were a number of landlords—particularly on estates which were built many years ago and have remained in the same ownership—who, because of estate policy, have maintained, for example, all slate roofs on certain Cotswold estates or all-brick buildings in others, and driving through a well-kept estate one can see that. But today such things might not be in the interests of good husbandry or good estate management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it would be wrong to legislate to stop landlords doing such things, particularly because tenants who took those farms knew that that particular kind of obligation would be laid upon them. If those two points could be given the Government's attention, we would not press the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ensure that before we put these matters to a vote the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with my query about the meaning of the word" or" in 32. If it is interpreted as" either—or" I shall be most distressed. I do not see the relevance or meaning of that sole word as it stands, although it has great relevance to these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise one point which follows from Amendment No. 60 and which has implications in my constituency. You will recollect, Mr. Costain, that within the national parks there is stringent planning control over new farm buildings, and Ministers, and no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary, will recall the celebrated case of a Mr. Sinclair, one of
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
my constituents, who erected a cattle shed in Hartsop, near Ullswater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be careful that we do not get ourselves in a position under paragraph (	<i>aa</i>) (	<i>ii</i>) whereby an arbitrator might go to a farm within a national park and decide that it is not necessary to use methods and materials which are specified in the agreement, while, on the other hand, the national park planning board would insist on those materials being used. I can envisage this causing catastrophic difficulty not only in the relationships between landlords and tenants in the national parks but also over their amenity value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost differential between doing the buildings as they are done in less beautiful parts of the country and the way the national park authorities specify could be tens of thousands of pounds. In case hon. Members do not recall the case of Mr. Sinclair, I can tell them that tens of thousands of pounds were in dispute as the difference between normal costs and those in the national park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could mean tremendous differences between landlord and tenant. I can envisage that if the balance were to be upset-1 am thinking of the National Trust, which I believe is the biggest landowner in my constituency—it could make a massive difference so far as organisation of the trust was concerned. If the Minister will consider that point, I shall be grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To go further than my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) who has just raised the matter of national parks, I believe that this is an important point. The cost difference between doing it in accordance with regulations laid down by, say, the Peak Park Planning Board in my own constituency and by the ordinary planning authority could be massive. As my hon. Friend has said, it is important that, while we should make the maximum use of our agricultural land wherever it is, from time to time we have to meet the requirements of the National Park Planning Boards, which have an important job to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this point will be fully taken on board by the Minister. In my constituency there have been certain problems between the local NFU and the Peak Park Planning Board. The amendments could have an important bearing on future discussions, future negotiations and future arbitration. I hope that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
the hon. Gentleman will comment on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support some of the remarks that hon. Gentlemen opposite have made. We have experienced a great deal of difficulty in the national parks, where requirements are far more stringent than they would be elsewhere. I hope that my hon. Friend will seriously look at this problem from the point of view not only of tenant farmers but of farmers generally. The public, if they want to retain amenities in the national parks, must be accountable for maintaining these facilities and the environment in these areas. The difference in costs should not fall on the shoulders of the few who happen to reside in the parks. We have made this point again and again to successive Governments. So far we have not had a willing ear to these requests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman is not quite right. I must make it clear that, in the case of Mr. Sinclair that I mentioned, a good deal of help has come from public sources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A good deal of help has certainly come, but still the requirement exists that materials to be used on farm buildings in the national park are way and above more expensive than they would be elsewhere. I know of no direct assistance that is regularly available to farmers in this situation to make up the difference. There is a certain amount, but in the national park which I have the privilege to represent farmers are always up against this problem. Not only are our materials a difficult problem, but the situation of buildings comes into it, and costs consquently rise that are not immediately noticeable in the form of materials. I urge that consideration be given to this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members have raised a point which is important and will grow in importance as living standards rise and as the nation can afford to be more concerned about these matters, and rightly so. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) has widened the scope of the discussion beyond the position of the tenant and has raised the general question, which I shall be happy to look at again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on the specific clause, we are talking about the interpretation which
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
I put on the phrases" good husbandry" and" sound estate management". I have already undertaken to look at this further and to make absolutely sure that the interpretation is as I have described. If we feel that it is necessary to narrow it a little or be more specific, we shall certainly bring forward appropriate amendments on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the two points of substance raised by hon. Members. On the specific point raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stain-ton), I can confirm that the first order is intended as an alternative, and in a way I am talking about an either-or situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that "or", at the end of line 32, would render (i) and (ii) mutually exclusive. Perhaps I have it entirely wrong, but English as I use it would mean that. I would prefer to substitute" and as at present" for "or". This is not immediately relevant to the series of amendments we are discussing, but it is so enmeshed and embedded in them that it could not be avoided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my understanding. As I read it, there are two" or" s, but we will look at this drafting point that the hon. Member has raised and I will come back to him on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the hon. Member is correct. The governing aspect is "any item or part". In other words, in one item sub-paragraph (i) may apply, in another sub-paragraph (ii). They are not mutually exclusive one of the other; each might be applicable. If we had "and", it would mean that they would both have to delete "and substitute".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "And" is appropriate. If I am correct, the hon. Member would readily acquiesce in my fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "And" would be wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "And is appropriate" is the suggestion we were discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is perfect, particularly parliamentary draftsmen. If we can improve the wording, we shall do so. My hon. Friend is quite right about the interpretation. I will stick to my undertaking to consider the hon. Member's suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a comma, we will put it in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no misunderstanding about what it is supposed to mean. The argument is solely between the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) and ourselves whether his suggested additional words would improve the clause, make it easier to understand and more clear cut. Certainly we will look at this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the only point I wanted to make, save to remind hon. Members that I have undertaken to look at Amendment No. 60. I will come back on that on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 78, in page 13, line 32, leave out second "or" and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and (ii) by substituting such longer period of time for the time specified in the notice in which the work is to be done as he thinks reasonable in all the circumstances; or".</p></blockquote>
The amendment follows the philosophy of the amendments we have already debated and is in line with them. Once the period which the tenant has been given to comply with a notice to remedy or to do work has expired, the landlord is entitled to serve a notice to quit where the tenant has failed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
As the law stands, and in this respect, Clause 11 would not alter the position. It is possible for a tenant to oppose a notice to quit, even if he admits he has failed to comply with a notice to remedy on the grounds that the notice gave insufficient time in which to do the work or remedy the breach. I hope that is abundantly clear to the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman would like me to read it again, I should be happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must apologise for using copious notes, but, as I say, these highly legal matters require full and detailed explanation. In the interests of fairness between landlord and tenant it is more equitable that an arbitrator should judge the reasonableness of the time specified, after seeing the condition of the farm, soon after the service of the notice. It follows that the tenant would be debarred from challenging the reasonableness of the time at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
