As the Budget Statement is being made this afternoon, I think it will be for the convenience of the Committee not to sit this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a welcome motion. We had not lost hope that the Government were totally short of their senses altogether, and we are glad to see that there is a vestige of sense left. We realise that there may be other reasons for the motion. I suppose that, during the course of the afternoon, some right hon. and hon. Members opposite may be expecting a call to another place down the road when the Prime Minister makes his new appointments. I feel sure that there will be some eager heart beats among them when the telephone rings. I am sure that if we did meet this afternoon, some of the Ministers' minds might not be on the matters in hand. t is wise not to sit this afternoon, and the motion is acceptable to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sincerely seeking your guidance, Mr. Costain. Amendment (s) has been selected. It concerns a taxation matter. Amendment (r) has not, but it is fundamental to many of the things we are talking about. If it is out of order, I am sure that it is not outside my ingenuity to devise some kind of wording that might be in order, given your guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Member. Amendment (s) concerns an exemption and is therefore in order. Amendment (r) would create a new liability, which is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a hypothetical ruling. If the hon.

	<li>one or more such applications having been made within that period, either—</li></ol>

	<p>	<i>Amendment (a) proposed to the proposed new clause—[1st</i> April]—in line 15, leave out paragraph (b).</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the closing of the sitting last Thursday, I had just begun my remarks, so I do not intend to start again exactly where I left off. It is better to begin again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter which concerns us particularly here is subsection (2) of new Clause 9. It is the definition of the phrase " the relevant period". We understand from paragraph (	<i>a</i>)of subsection (2) that, after the death of the tenant, any aspiring successor who has a near relation as defined in new Clause 8 has three months from the day of the tenant's death to make an application to the tribunal to be allowed to inherit the tenancy. That seems clear enough, but it is paragraph (	<i>b</i>)which concerns us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is apparently to be a hiatus between the passing of the Bill by Parliament until 1st January 1977. when the first three-month period begins. Let us take round figures: this means that if the Bill receives Royal Assent on 1st June, as I understand it, any farm which became vacant from 1st June could be left in a sort of hiatus until 31st March 1977, That, I think, means that for 10 months that farm will be in a state of complete vacuum, when nobody knows exactly who is going to become the tenant. It seems a very unsatisfactory arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should explain to us why this paragraph has been put into the Bill. It seems quite wrong that, after the death of a tenant, the landlord would not know whether or not he could relet the farm for a period of 10 months, because he would not know whether or not some distant or unknown applicant might come along and serve a notice on him saying that he intended or wanted to put a claim in to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1084</span>
inherit the tenancy. It is very bad for a farm to be left in a state of vacuum of that sort for as long a period. t would be better to let the three-month period begin on the day the Bill gets the Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In debate on an earlier amendment, the Government made it clear their view there was a widespread understanding of what is contained in these new clauses. We argued that more notice should be given and people should have an opportunity of getting to understand the implications of these new clauses over a period of time, but the Government rejected our arguments. They said there had been plenty of publicity, with plenty of comment in the farming Press and through the various organisations like the NFU and the CLA, and that a greater period of notice was unnecessary. If it is unnecessary, if the Government feel that the people know the implications of these new clauses, why is it necessary, we should ask, for them to have a gap between the passing of the Bill and the moment when the three-months' notice explained in paragraph (	<i>a</i>)should begin?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important matters. I can envisage the greatest difficulty being caused both to tenants and landlords by the wording of paragraph (	<i>b</i>). Take the case of a tenant who dies and the landlord intends, let us say, to let the farm to his son. t would seem to me that he would not be able to let the farm to the son under the workings of paragraph (	<i>b</i>). He would not be able to do that until 1st April next year because he would not know, nor would the tenant know, that somebody else might come along and put in an application to become the tenant of the farm, and the tenant's son would not know whether he won. He would naturally like to take certain steps if he was to become the new tenant. If we are to have these provisions, we ought to get the son into the tenancy quickly and it is foolish for us to have a proviso about 1st January
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1085</span>
1977. We will listen carefully to what the Minister says, and I hope the Government will agree that paragraph (	<i>b</i>) would be better out of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a fairly straightforward point and I do not think it should detain the Committee long. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has explained that the effect of the amendment would be to remove, firstly, the special arrangements which will apply between Royal Assent and 1st January 1977, and, secondly, the enabling power given to the Lord Chancellor to prescribe by order a later date than 1st January 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is to come into effect on Royal Assent and to apply to any death which occurs thereafter. But it will clearly be necessary to provide a breathing space for the setting up of the necessary machinery for dealing with applications to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. This will be done by statutory instrument, subject to annulment, after Royal Assent. If we are to avoid unfairness to the close relatives of a tenant who dies after Royal Assent, some form of retrospective application must be provided for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Member will be prepared to bear with us. It is obviously necessary to prepare the necessary regulations. We have already referred to the need to provide guidance to the ALT. It would be impracticable to expect it immediately on Royal Assent to be in a position to receive applications. This is a once and for all breathing space. It is not a thing which carries on. It is simply a necessary hurdle which we have to get over before the tribunal will be in a position to receive applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) provides that applications for a vacant tenancy must be made within three months of the date of death, while subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) provides that, where a tenant dies between Royal Assent and '1st January 1977, application, to be valid, may not be made before 1st January or after 31st March 1977. This concession will clearly be at its maximum for any deaths which may occur immediately after Royal Assent, and down to a minimum for deaths occurring on 31st December. From 1st January 1977 onwards, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
normal relevant period of three months will apply. The Lord Chancellor is given power to specify by order a later date than 1st January 1977 if this should become necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members opposite will appreciate that this is simply a precaution which it would be only right to take. I believe that these provisions are fair and reasonable, and that the Committee on reflection will understand that this is an essential part of the machinery required to put the scheme into operation. I hope the hon. Member, with that explanation, will be prepared to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I wish the Parliamentary Secretary would apply himself to the point I raised. He has not explained what he thinks the implication will be of the difficulties which will be caused in this intervening period, the hardships to be caused both to the landlord and tenant by the uncertainties that may go on—and I understand it could be for as long as 10 months if the Bill becomes law on 1st June 1977. It is a very unsatisfactory situation. I would have thought the Minister would try to explain what his view is about that period of uncertainty. I can imagine that, when we get to next spring, if we were to have as early a spring as this, the tenant's son would not know. I guess this sort of thing may happen. He would not know whether he should order seed or fertiliser, not knowing whether he could get the farm sown next spring. He would be in a very difficult position if he did not have the tenancy at that time. This is something to which the landlord could not commit himself, or to which the tenant would not want to commit himself, and it is a very unsatisfactory arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that when a farm becomes vacant—and my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) will know as much about this as anyone, because he deals with a great many cases where tenants come into farms and leave farms—and there is no certainty of a tenancy from 1st June or 1st July right the way through to 1st April next year, the position is very unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be cases where there is a dispute as to who is to become the tenant.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1087</span>
The provisions in new Clause 10 cover joint applications, disputes and what is to happen. Let us suppose that a tenant dies on 1st July this year, and leaves two sons who do not get on and who both apply. There could be great dispute, because neither of them could be given the tenancy, and the tribunal could not sit until after April next year. The two sons would be in argument with each other as to who should get the tenancy, but the tribunal could not resolve that situation until after 1st April next year, because it would not know whether there was another application coming in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very serious situation could arise, and I see the greatest possible danger in delay. In his reply, the Minister did not apply himself to these cases of difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his reply my hon. Friend said that certain machinery had to be set up, regulations had to be agreed and there might be legislation, which takes time. I think that is the basis of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that situation, and I am grateful to the Minister of State for explaining what his hon. Friend meant. Of course, I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that, and I understand that there may be some difficulty in setting up the machinery. But this is a matter of the utmost urgency. I hate to be criticising the Government all the time, but they should have thought of this before they pushed in these new clauses, because, having decided that we are to have this legislation, it is absolutely vital that it comes into effect as soon as possible after the Royal Assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give us his comments about these difficulties and anomalies which will almost certainly arise, particularly where there are disputes between rival applicants who will have to sit back and wait until after 1st April in case more applications come along. In a case like that, I suppose that a farm would not be sown with corn in the spring of next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help, but I think the hon. Gentleman is being a little disingenuous—and I say that in a spirit of helpfulness. The point I am trying to make is that we are not suggesting that this is an ideal arrangement. What we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1088</span>
saying is that the practicality of the situation is such that it is inevitable that, over this first period, shortly after the Bill becomes law, the period of uncertainty will be a little longer—and I say that advisedly. But we must remember that, under the present set-up, the landlord has to serve a notice to quit on the death of the tenant, and neither the tenant's son nor the landlord's son can take over the tenancy until the landlord's notice to quit expires at the end of the next full year of the tenancy. So the hon. Member is carrying his argument a little far, although I acknowledge that he has a point when he says that the farm will not be sown with seed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This problem arises every time there is the death of a tenant, when the landlord serves a notice to quit, and it is something which the tenant-farmer's family would rather not have. But if agreement is reached between the landlord and the tenant on a successor, then nothing is changed and the case does not have to go to the Agricultural Land Tribunal anyway. So the short answer is that we understand that additional uncertainty will arise but there is no way round it, because we must prepare the necessary regulations and enable the Agricultural Land Tribunal to prepare itself for the workload. But I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will do everything in our power to expedite the process as quickly as possible, and I do not think that what we expect to be a period of three months is at all unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue this matter much longer, but I would argue with one point made by the Parliamentary Secretary. He said that where the landlord and the tenant agree about the succession, the case need not go to the Agricultural Land Tribunal, and I accept that. But the case could go to the tribunal if a second person appeared on the scene up to 31st March next, and said "I want to be considered, and I am an applicant". There could be quite serious difficulty in that case, particularly if the second application was put in on 31st March next and the tenant, who had by agreement been given the tenancy, was not aware of that. I could imagine a quarter to midnight application going into the tribunal, which could leave the tenant, who had been in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1089</span>
agreement with the landlord, in a very difficult situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel sure that we want to speed this matter up as much as possible. On the other hand, I can see the Minister's difficulty and can appreciate that this has to happen. All I am saying is that the practicalities of the tenant's right, and the difficulties of a farm being left in limbo, affect both the output from the farm and the landlord and tenant. So will he make sure that all these points are covered in some directive, so that both landlord and tenant, and the landlord's agent and tenant's agent, know where they are? This is what we must be sure about.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1090</span>
I can see that this has to happen, but we must be prepared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite often, we are accused outside this House of passing legislation without fully thinking out the difficulties and anomalies which might arise, and we have pointed out the difficulties, which will now appear on the record. Like my hon. Friend, I see the difficulties of the Government, and in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Brought up and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time. Under subsection (1), any eligible person as defined in new Clause 8 may apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal within the relevant period of three months from the death of the tenant for a direction entitling him to a tenancy of the holding. If only one person applies for the tenancy, then, under subsection (2), the tribunal first has to satisfy itself that he is an eligible person as defined in new Clause 8—that is to say, that he is a close relative of the deceased, has worked on the holding for at least five years out of the seven years immediately preceding death, and that he is not already the occupier of a commercial unit of agricultural land—and then go on to determine whether he is in its opinion a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding. Subsection (3) requires the tribunal to go through the same procedure for every applicant if there is more than one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) gives special priority to the deceased's wishes if these are set out in his will. Where there has been a valid designation—and by that I mean that the deceased states a clear intention in his will—the Agricultural Land Tribunal is required, first, to consider the claim of that person. If it is satisfied that he is both an eligible person and a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding, then it will disregard all other applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A valid designation has to be a clear and unequivocal statement, such as "I wish my son John to take over my holding". On the other hand, if the tribunal is not satisfied that he is an eligible person or a suitable person—for example, the named
	<span class='label label-info column'>1092</span>
son may have been living abroad for the last 20 years— it then goes on to consider the other applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) requires the Agricultural Land Tribunal to give effect to its decision by means of a direction, subject, of course, to its consideration of any application by the landlord for the repossession of his holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (6), if the Agricultural Land Tribunal decides that more than one applicant is both eligible and suitable to take over the holding, it is required to choose between them and select one of them, unless the landlord is prepared to agree to joint tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) is a safeguard for both the landlord and the agricultural interest, in that the Agricultural Land Tribunal is required to ask the landlord for his views on the suitability as a tenant of any or all of the applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding whether any applicant is a suitable person to take over the tenancy, the Agricultural Land Tribunal is required by subsection (8) to have regard to all relevant matters. These include the agricultural training and practical experience of an applicant, his age, his physical health, whether he has sufficient money to farm the holding properly, and the views, if any, of the landlord as to his suitability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (9) enables the Agricultural Land Tribunal to make a direction specifying that there should be a joint tenancy of the holding, but only provided that the landlord is prepared to agree to it and to the number of tenants proposed. The maximum figure of four reflects current legislation elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsections (10), (11) and (12) are technical provisions dealing with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1093</span>
deceased tenant's will. Under subsection (11), for instance, it will be possible for an elder son to be designated on condition that he survives the testator for a period of 30 days, after which the younger son is designated in his place; while subsection (12) follows the tenor of a somewhat similar provision in Section 27(	<i>1</i>) of the Administration of Estates Act 1925.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (13) is a particularly important subsection, because it provides a means whereby a landlord and the sole applicant or the sole remaining applicant may independently reach agreement without completing the procedure before the Agricultural Land Tribunal. In such a case, once agreement has been reached, the sole applicant is enabled to withdraw his application and no further proceedings before the tribunal need take place. This provision also enables any applicant who does not wish to proceed further with an application to bring it to an end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for explaining the contents of new Clause 10. I suspect that the whole Committee regards this as the second most important clause in the Bill. As I said earlier, I believe we would regard new Clause 8 as the most important, but without doubt this is almost as important and we have put down a number of amendments which I hope we shall be debating shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a situation very similar to that which we were in at the end of the last sitting when we debated new Clause 9. I said on that occasion that, as we had had the opportunity to debate those matters on the Floor of the House, and as we had a number of amendments down which probed and proposed various alterations to make the clause a better one, there was not much point in having a protracted debate on the Second Reading of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, therefore, that the best thing to do would be for us to move fairly briskly. I do not in any way imply that I want to preclude hon. Members from making their comments on the generality of the clause, but I hope that fairly soon we can move to the amendments which get to the guts of the matter. I do not see any point in having a long debate on the Second Reading of New Clause 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was somewhat taken aback by the interpretation which the Parliamentary Secretary attributed to subsection 13). The reverberations of those remarks could be profound. The fact that an application may be withdrawn may create a number of precedents in a number of directions, and this is a matter one would like to ponder and perhaps return to on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meantime, my only contribution to this debate is in terms of the liability to capital transfer tax. It can be argued, on the one hand, that succession to tenancy is not disposable and therefore not marketable and does not attract any value. That is one argument, but the other which can be advanced is that lack of transferability does not necessarily remove value. Although it is out of order for debate, I make a passing reference to my Amendment (r), which was an attempt to clarify the situation. We shall have to return to this situation. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will then find it opportune to give a brief indication of his views on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause read a Second time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed clause, in line 5, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>' and whether he would suffer substantial hardship if he were not granted a tenancy of the holding'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Amendment (	<i>j</i>), in line 63, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>' (14) The Tribunal shall not give a direction entitling an applicant to a tenancy of a holding unless they are satisfied that the applicant would suffer substantial hardship if the direction were not made'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious to all the hon. Members that these two amendments deal with precisely the same point. The Government base their whole case entirely on relative hardship. I have emphasised this time and time again during our debates on these new clauses. The Government say that they want to limit the application of the landlord to hardship cases only. t is odd, therefore, that the new clauses do not require an applicant to prove that he would suffer hardship if he were not granted tenancy of the holding. This is a fundamental point. New Clause 10 is so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1095</span>
worded that if the tribunal is satisfied that an applicant is "an eligible person" and is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding"</p></blockquote>
it shall give a direction entitling him to the tenancy, subject to the landlord convincing the tribunal under new Clause 11, that it should consent to notice to quit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
t is conceivable that an applicant may be both eligible and suitable but would not suffer undue hardship if he did not get the holding—for example if he were a rich man or had sold a farm which he could have farmed himself or was able to earn a better living other than by farming the holding. Again I make the point, which seems to have been forgotten by hon. Members opposite, that we are dealing only with hardship cases. It has been forgotten so far in the debates in the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 11 would enable a landlord to seek consent to his notice to quit on the ground
	<br><blockquote><p>"that greater hardship would be caused by withholding it than by giving consent to the operation of the notice".</p></blockquote>
This is done by Section 25(	<i>1</i>)(	<i>d</i>) of the 1948 Act which is imported into new Clause 11. It is no answer to leaving out a hardship test for the applicant for a tenancy. The fact that a landlord does not succeed on a greater hardship test would not necessarily mean that a tenant who has applied for it would suffer hardship if he did not get the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be appropriate to raise here a case which has recently been drawn to my attention and on which I should like the Parliamentary Secretary's advice. Obviously, I shall leave out the area and the address of the landowner, but it is important, in considering this clause and the amendments, that we have the advice of the Government on important matters. It relates to a case drawn to my attention by a landowner in Yorkshire recently advised by a tenant that the tenant wants to retire. His tenant has no children but asks if his nephew, who is well qualified can take over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put this to the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that he will comment. In paraphrasing what the landowner said, I would say that he put two points to me, He says in effect, "If I refuse to let this holding and other farms I shall gradually destroy a village farming community
	<span class='label label-info column'>1096</span>
which has existed for hundreds of years; if I let the farm to a young man—a nephew rather distantly related to the existing tenant but a young man with a family—it is unlikely that I, my children or my grandchildren would be able to obtain vacant possession for 70 to a 100 years, or at any rate for a considerable period and finally I anticipate the need, when I die, to sell 75 per cent of my property to meet capital transfer tax. If I relet the farm, I will halve its value and be forced to sell a much larger acreage. If I farm it myself I could obtain a reasonable earned income, but if I let it, the income would be much reduced and subject to tax at unearned income rates as well. If I refuse to let, I shall remove one more opportunity for a young man to enter the farming industry".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of many landowners who have put a great deal into the community and into agriculture, I pose those questions to the Parliamentary Secretary and ask him, "What would you do in these circumstances?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe profoundly, as I have indicated before, that the tenancy system has worked well for generations and is the principal reason for the efficiency of British agriculture. If we want to encourage people to enter farming, and not just the elite of the tenants' children—a privileged group—we must encourage the landlords, as I said in earlier debates. Landlords are not just private individuals but local authorities, Government bodies and institutions. It is important that landowners, whatever and whoever they may be, should be encouraged to let property, but that will only be achieved if the level of taxation is reduced and the right to succession restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two amendments would require the applicants to prove hardship. Again, we come back to the word "hardship" in new Clause 10, which has been introduced at such a late stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does it mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have put the question to the Parliamentary Secretary on a number of occasions but too often the whole matter has been glossed over. It is important that the applicant should be able to prove hardship, and this would require the tribunal not to grant the tenancy unless it was satisfied that the applicant would suffer substantial hardship if a direction
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1097</span>
was not made. I have made my argument on these two amendments perfectly clear, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, in replying, will do the Committee the courtesy of giving his view perhaps not necessarily the full Government view, of the the pertinent points I have raised and to which the farming community require an answer during this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what my hon. Friend has said. The most important factor in landlord-tenant legislation is certainty. These clauses are riddled with uncertainty, and the Government have com£ed the uncertainty during their passage. Firstly, they did so on the educational qualification for succession, which is now uncertain, and, secondly, on the provision that a prospective successor would have to have worked on the farm. Both points have been made more uncertain as a result of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most important that a greater degree of certainty should be included in the instructions given to the tribunal and when the Parliamentary Secretary replies, he must answer the case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and so eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West, (Mr. Hawkins) in a previous debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The successor to a tenancy will be allowed to succeed although he may be a very wealthy man. Those in my constituency are not wealthy—we have been all over that and I do not want to raise it again. But the Parliamentary Secretary must tell us whether he expects the tribunal, with the clause as drafted, to allow a successor, who by no stretch of imagination would otherwise suffer hardship, to succeed to the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only this weekend some tenant farmers raised this matter with me, and another matter which I shall raise later. Obviously, in the farming community this point has been grasped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has put this case very well, but I want to re-emphasise the matter I raised last time, of a widow, with a son of 14 or 15 or 16 who lets for a period of time, and has let before this Bill was every thought of, to an occupier. She would have expected that when the tenant died or reached retiring age she would be able to get the land back again. By this Bill, her son, when he
	<span class='label label-info column'>1098</span>
became 23 or 25, would be excluded from the right to inherit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite wrong that, when a widow has let, say, a 250-acre farm because she does not be feel capable of taking it over. When the tenant dies or retires, the landlord's son will not be able to be considered by the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when a tenant says in his will who he wishes to succeed him? There may be two or three applicants before a tribunal, all of whom are suitably qualified, but one of whom is regarded by the tribunal as the best tenant. If the person to whom the inheritance has been willed is well qualified but not regarded as highly as the tribunal's choice, can the will override the tribunal? This point should be cleared up in the instructions given to the tribunal on the priorities to be given in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very conscious that, in the operation of the scheme, there must be social justice, not only for the close relatives when a tenant dies, but also for the landlord. However, I do not believe that this would be met by the introduction of a further criterion of "substantial hardship" as a legal requirement to be established by the applicant before the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For one thing, the difficulty for the tribunal in defining what constitutes "substantial hardship" in relation to the wide variety of types of applicant will be too great. Moreover, the concept of hardship to the family when a tenant dies is inherent in the scheme and the potential elements of hardship are already encompassed by the eligibility conditions in new Clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The applicant must be a near relative of the deceased tenant, and must have been concerned with the working of the holding. These factors in themselves suggest a strong likelihood of a connection with the holding which could be painful for the applicant to sever, and, in many cases, would, no doubt, be financially detrimental as well. And, of course, the applicant must not already occupy a commercial holding except in circumstances which give him no security of tenure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister endeavouring to equate a financial setback with actual hardship? This is a relative matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from that. If the hon. Member will allow me to continue my speech for a little longer, I may be able to help him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am arguing that we are trying to give the tribunal guidance in relation to who should deserve to succeed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anyone at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is implied in what I am saying. t would be a mistake simply to give blanket guidance to the tribunal when deciding where there is hardship. After an applicant has satisfied the tribunal as to his eligibility and as to his suitability to farm the holding, his succession is still liable to challenge when the landlord seeks consent to the operation of the notice to quit. This is when the landlord has the opportunity to raise the question that greater hardship would be caused by the tribunal's withholding than by giving consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This greater hardship test is currently set out in Section 25(1) (	<i>d</i>)of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, and is made applicable to succession proceedings under new Clause 11. The hardship which can be raised by the landlord is of any nature and is not confined to hardship directly to himself. For example, hardship to his son who had hoped to take over the holding may be raised, and we are providing for this in the revision of the statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, the tribunal will compare the hardship which would be caused to the applicant for a tenancy by its consenting to the notice to quit with the hardship which would be caused by letting the applicant succeed to the tenancy. Again, this is no easy task for the tribunal, but it will be easier to judge two actual sets of circumstances against each other than to judge hardship in the abstract as required by the amendment. The interests of the landlord and his family are therefore protected in this way. For this reason, and because of the other factor which I have mentioned, I do not consider these amendments can be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not want to interrupt the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton)
	<span class='label label-info column'>1100</span>
—I do not suppose it would have made any difference anyway, But I, too, have received a letter from the landowner to whom he referred, and it would be better for me to reply direct to the landowner rather than to discuss the case in Committee. That letter raised not just the question of succession, but also the capital transfer tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all tied up with this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Inherent in the tax is our commitment to the dispersal of the concentration of wealth which is held by a very small proportion of the community. I do not know how wealthy this landlord is, but it is inherent in the situation that he will be adversely affected by the tax, though he will be able to obtain a concession on any land in hand up to a maximum of 1,000 acres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect landlords to get advice and take advantage of the significant ways of minimising their liability under this tax. The most obvious way is to make the transfer to the spouse before death, but there are other ways. There would be no point in my denying that the family of a landlord will be adversely affected by this tax on his death. I am not trying to be unhelpful, but rather to be fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) said there was uncertainty in relation to the two concessions to which he referred because people did not know what would be the final outcome. But we shall be drafting amendments and the legislation, when it is enacted, will be absolutely clear. The border will be changed, but it will be no more fuzzy as a consequence of the concessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the discretionary aspect of the matter which concerned me. It is not clear from the word go to the tenant or the landlord whether the tenant's son or relative is an eligible person because discretion is allowed to the tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I accept that. If we get the legislation right, I am not sure it is less clear to say that a son must have had three years' agricultural education than to refer to three years' full-time education. This is an arguable point. It certainly widens the eligibility, but I would disagree that it blurs the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1101</span>
distinction between eligibility and non-eligibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the son having to work on the farm is a significant concession, and it is important that we draft the legislation in a way which makes clear that we are meeting the sort of case raised by the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells). This is an exception and we are not departing from the basic principle that, in general, a near relative must have a close identification with the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West. (Mr. Hawkins) about the willing of the tenancy, but there is a later amendment on this point and I think it would be more appropriate if I reserved my comments until that is discussed. This is an argument which has been put forward repeatedly by hon. Members opposite. Ido not say that in any criticism, but I hope we can move on fairly quickly to the more specific points raised in subsequent amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1do not want to extend the debate, but merely to register my reactions to what the Minister has said. He relies substantially on the doctrine of relative hardship as derived from the Agricultural Holdings Act, but such an argument could be conducted on a highly esoteric level, and we are trying to import, in amendments (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>j</i>), a concept of absolute hardship on the part of the applicant. This is a matter we must pursue in the vote which will follow and on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. In spite of what we heard on television last night from the new Prime Minister, the extent of Socialism being perpetrated has been made clear by the Parliamentary Secretary.

In particular, he did not reply to the point I made about an applicant for a tenancy who may be a very rich man and may have sold a farm which he could have worked in order to apply for the tenancy of a holding. Perhaps the Minister will give further consideration to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman again mentioned the eligibility criteria which we debated under new Clause 8, but I remind him that he widened the criteria basis for eligibility in earlier debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has replied adequately to the point I made in regard to the letter, which has perhaps been received by all members of the Committee, from the landowner in Yorkshire, who set out the case very clearly. I am delighted that he sent a similar letter to the Minister. He has laid out clearly the situation which will face agriculture as a result of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary could send me a copy of the reply he is sending to this gentleman. As he has sent letters fairly widely, I do not think that that would be breaching any confidence. One point he makes is that there will be a very big reduction in tenancies available for young people. coming in to farming and this is undeniable

Likewise, the tax element, briefly referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, will inevitably lead to the break-up of substantial agricultural holdings. Surely that is not to the advantage of agriculture in this country, because on other occasions the Parliamentary Secretary has said, "We want to amalgamate. We want to put farms together, to make more effective agricultural holdings." The capital transfer tax and other pernicious legislation promoted by this Government will break up agricultural holdings which are of economic and viable size. I do not believe, despite the information which has been forthcoming from the Parliamentary Secretary, that he has given an adequate reply to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The overriding reason for these amendments is to probe the general attitude of the Government towards a testator's validly-expressed preference. Behind the amendments there are various points of detail on which the Parliamentary Secretary's comments would be greatly appreciated.In subsection (4), line there appear the words "a person validly designated". The same expression occurs also in lines 44 and 59. This seems to be an important phrase but it is not clearly interpreted. Against what criteria is an individual "validly designated"? We would like some clarification of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (10)(a) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"contains an effective specific request".</p></blockquote>
Why is the word "effective" used there, as opposed to a "specific" request? Whether the request is effective is not a question of judgment but a question of fact. There seems here to be an objectionable adjectival intrusion into the Bill by this word "effective". Subsection (10)(	<i>b</i>) introduces a very clear judgment into the situation and imposes a duty on the Agricultural Land Tribunal, and this is further extended in terms of subsection (11). Subsection (12) terminates with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be valid even if the probate or administration by virtue of which he was such a person at the giving of the direction is subsequently revoked or varied."</p></blockquote>
The ruling of the Agricultural Land Tribunal could supersede any findings that might be made in any other court and would be final in this matter. This is an important point to be explored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the Committee if I were to remind hon. Members of the words of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales when he explained to the House on 8th March last why the Government attached a certain amount of weight to a testamentary request made by the deceased tenant. He said that it seemed difficult to justify a scheme which provided a legal right to apply for succession to a tenancy only in cases where this had been expressed as his wish in a will left by the deceased tenant. On the other hand, he said, it seemed that it would be equally wrong to go to the other extreme and to say that a testamentary bequest was of no relevance and should be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We concluded that it would be right to provide that an applicant, designated by the deceased in his will should have an overriding claim as against any other applicants, provided of course that the Agricultural Land Tribunal was satisfied as to the other relevant matters. This seems to us to be a fair and workable arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

will, then the tribunal will consider that applicant first. When I spoke of "other matters" I was referring to the fact that whether or not he actually succeeds to the holding will depend on the outcome of the subsequent procedures of the Agricultural Land Tribunal—namely, it will ascertain in the first instance whether he is an eligible person, because it is conceivable that he could be named in the will but not be an eligible person, for example, he may not have worked on the holding. Secondly, the Agricultural Land Tribunal will decide whether or not he is a suitable person to succeed to the holding, taking into account, among other things, the view of the landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must pursue this point of eligibility and suitability in terms of a testator. This is expressly referred to in new Clause 10. Can the Parliamentary Secretary point to me where this eligibility criteria must be met?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In talking of the valid designation, we are talking about the will. That is the first point. The second is that, in talking of an eligible person, we are talking of whether the person applying, whether or not he is named in the will, is eligible under the criteria laid down in new Clause 8, namely, that he has worked on the holding or is a near relative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must bring the Parliamentary Secretary back to subsection (4). Can he please point out to me where the Agricultural Land Tribunal is required to determine the eligibility—I am not talking of suitability—of the person validly designated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to subsection (2), which states quite clearly
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where only one application is made under this section the Tribunal, if satisfied that the applicant is an eligible person, shall determine whether he is in their opinion a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding."</p></blockquote>
That answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Parliamentary Secretary reply to a point I raised on a previous amendment? Is he making absolutely clear that, where the Agricultural Land Tribunal, perhaps had three people before it, one of them a person designated
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
in the will, in whatever order it might put those applicants—and the person named by the testator in his will might be the third of the three—that person would necessarily get the tenancy if he were an eligible person in every other respect? Is no discretion left to the tribunal to choose somebody else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, as I made absolutely clear in saying that the Agricultural Land Tribunal will not consider other applicants if the willed applicant is a suitable person. In moving the amendment, the hon. Member quite reasonably said it was a probing amendment to ascertain what priority would in practice attach to being named in the will, and I have indicated that it will be a practical and very substantial priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Total priority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends what the hon. Gentleman means by "total". If that person is not deemed to be a suitable person and another applicant is, that other applicant will succeed. Subsection (4) implements this decision by providing that, where an applicant is validly designated in the deceased's will—and "validly designated" is defined in subsection (10)—his application shall be considered first. If, after careful examination of the application in accordance with the requirements cf subsections (7) and (8), the Agricultural Land Tribunal decides that he is a suitable person, it will dismiss the other applications without considering them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the other extreme, where there is no bequest, all applications will be heard and one or more may be found suitable, or none as the case may be. The Agricultural Land Tribunal is not obliged, of course, to find one of them suitable. I must emphasise that the question of whether or not there has been a designation in the will does not affect the position of the landlord, whose turn will come at the hearing of the notice to quit. It affects only the position of the applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to delete subsection (4) would have the effect of ignoring the deceased tenant's wishes in the matter and mean that all applicants would appear before the tribunal on an equal footing, whether or not there had been a bequest. For the reasons I described at the beginning, that seems to us to be not a desirable situation.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1107</span>
Subsections (10), (11) and (12), which amendments (g), (h) and (i) seek to remove from the Bill, are technical subsections dealing with the bequest itself. If the hon. Gentleman wishes me to go into those technical points in detail, I shall be happy to do so, but I gained the impression that the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) was not interested in the priority which would, in practice, attach to the will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to follow up the queries which my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) put to the Parliamentary Secretary. I hope I am taking up his argument and his disquiet about this when I say that I, too, am a little vague about the meaning of subsection (4). It seems to me to be a strong hint in the wording of new Clause 10 that so far as an applicant who has been designated under a will is concerned one could argue, by the way this new clause is worded, that he need not be an eligible person at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading this clause, one is led to believe that if a person was not designated by the deceased tenant in his will, he would have the priorities under subsection (4). That is not clear, however, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at the wording of subsection (4). He has made clear in his remarks that the Government's intention is that a person designated under a will would only have this priority under subsection (4) provided that he was at the same time an eligible person under the provisions of new Clause 8. That is what I understood him to mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the Parliamentary Secretary falls back on subsection (2), I did so as well in studying it, but the more I studied it, the more I became obsessed with the stringency of the opening words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where only one application is made …"</p></blockquote>
One could well envisage a situation of a multiplicity of applications and yet working one's way through to a designated in-heritance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Member to read on to subsection (3), which meets his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has taken the words out of my mouth. Subsection
	<span class='label label-info column'>1108</span>
(3) covers the point made by my hon. Friend. But that still does not deal in my view with the position we have under subsection (4). As I understand it, subsections (2) and (3) apply when there is an applicant or a number of applicants who regard themselves as eligible persons who have not been designated under a will. Subsection (4) only applies when there has been a designation in the deceased's tenant's will. There is a real danger in the wording of this subsection that the deceased tenant can nominate a person who is perhaps not a near relative at all. That is the suspicion I have of the wording of this part of the clause. The Parliamentary Secretary has made clear that that is not his intention. At the same time, that is the way subsection (4) might be construed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman by reading subsection (4):
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the applicants under this section include a person validly designated by the deceased in his Will as the person he wished to succeed him as tenant of the holding, the Tribunal shall first make a determination under subsection (2) above as regards that person …"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman understand it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter for lawyers. The whip asks whether I understood it. There would be no courts in the country if everyone understood every word in the statutes. We ought to be careful. I am sure the Government would agree we would not want to create a situation where a tenant can nominate anyone. The situation would then come about where some tenants before their deaths could nominate some rich young men in their wills. It would be wrong for a tenant to be able to trade the succession of his tenancy to someone outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be helpful to the hon. Member. Let me make it plain. We cannot obviously stop a tenant bequeathing a farm to anyone he likes. He can write what he likes in his will. But if he makes the mistake of bequeathing his farm to a non-eligible person, when that person applies he will be bombed out immediately by the ALT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to reply briefly and perhaps get further comments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1109</span>
from the Minister. We are, Mr. Costain, encompassing the provisions of Amendment (o) in this debate. It may well be to the convenience of the Committee to bracket Amendment (o) with the amendments in this group, provided we have a separate vote thereon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the wish of the Committee, to save time we shall add to the group under consideration Amendment (o), in line 13, leave out ' Tribunal 'to'is' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'whilst satisfied as to the eligibility of the person so designated shall determine that such person t.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of Amendment (o) is to make clear that eligibility also applies to the person to whom the tenancy is willed and who makes due application to the tribunal. The Parliamentary Secretary relies upon subsections (2) and (3) to rebut our expressions of doubt as to eligibility in these circumstances. I cannot speak as a lawyer, but as a person fairly well-practised at serving on this sort of Committee, looking at statutes and so forth, as I read it, subsection (2) refers to only one application. Then the Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say that we should look at subsection (3) because subsection (3) brings it back to the singular. Subsection (3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where two or more applications are made under this section, then, subject to subsection (4) below"…</p></blockquote>
The validity of the opinion which the Parliamentary Secretary has offered turns on the interpretation of these words
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to subsection (4) below…"</p></blockquote>
My interpretation—and I have queried this to the extent of going so far as to put down Amendment (o)—is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to subsection (4) below"</p></blockquote>
implies, to put it mildly, that subsection (4) overrides the preceding two subsections. Perhaps I am wrong in this interpretation, but it is not by any means a ridiculous interpretation. If I can fall into this trap, if it be a trap and not a straightforward defect in drafting, I would hope that in any event the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise the confusion that is genuinely in one's mind on this matter, and at least go so far as to meet one's endeavours in Amendment (o).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1110</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point I would make is that the reference to subsection (4), if hon. Members read subsection (4), does not cancel subsections (2) and (3). We feel that Amendment (o) is unnecessary. The tribunal's consideration is carried out in a series of simple stages. The first stage is for it to determine whether or not each applicant is an eligible person as defined in new Clause 8. If an applicant is not eligible, he obviously cannot pursue his claim and will drop out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stage 2 will be to determine whether an eligible applicant is a suitable applicant as defined in subsection (8) and, if there is more than one eligible applicant, to consider each in turn. Both stage 1 and stage 2 are set out in subsections (2) and (3), the relevant words being, in subsection (2),
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Tribunal, is satisfied that the applicant is an eligible person, shall determine whether he is in their opinion a suitable person" …</p></blockquote>
and in subsection (3),
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where two or more applications are made … then … subsection (2) shall apply to each of the applicants as if he were the only applicant."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of subsection (4) is to give priority over other applicants to a person designated in the deceased tenant's will, provided that he is both eligible and is validly designated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer to the point, which I did not previously reply to, raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge? The word "effective" is used in the context of an effective designation. t must be a bequest which is drawn in proper legal terms—for example, it must not be ambiguous. It must be effective under the normal rules for the consideration of wills. I thought the hon. Member had a point when he said that his view of the word "effective" applied to the actual result. We regard the adjective " effective " as being any reference to where the statement in the will effectively communicates a coherent intention to any reader of the will. I hope that helps the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that it does not. t does not grant action to probate or administration to decide whether it is effective or not. It is superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better pursue this in correspondence with the hon. Gentleman. It is a minor technical point as to whether the word "effective" is redundant or not. The purpose of sub-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1111</span>
section (4) is to give priority over other applicants to a person designated in the deceased tenant's will, provided that he is both eligible and validity designated. So where someone is designated in the will, the tribunal will consider his application first—that is, it will consider whether he is an eligible person, whether the designation in the will is a valid designation, and, if so, whether he is a suitable person. If it is satisfied on all these points, it will not consider the claims of the other applicants—that is the effect of the word "only" in subsection (4)—
	<br><blockquote><p>… "the Tribunal‧ shall do so as regards … the other applicants only if the Tribunal determine that the person so designated is not … a suitable person to become the tenant of the holding."</p></blockquote>
So, as I have already explained, the tribunal may not consider whether a person is a suitable person until it has considered he is an eligible person. The amendment would merely be repetitive therefore, and is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel under a strong onus to reply, albeit briefly. I hope I am not daft, but I cannot follow the Parliamentary Secretary's reasoning in this matter at all. I follow what he said, but I do not accept that it is valid. One line of argument he has pursued is that, first of all, subsection (2) will not apply in the kinds of situation I am raising, and that it is restricted to one application in senses. senses. Then he proceeds to subsection (3), which can, in some circumstances, and in interpretations, be read as being non-applicable to subsection (3), where subsection (4) is brought into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore—and this is an argument which has not been considered by the Parliamentary Secretary, and has not as yet been advanced from this side—subsection (4) makes specific reference to a preceding subsection, which is subsection (2), and to that alone—not to subsection (3). Were its intention to comprehend subsection (3), one would expect that also to be referred to. This is highly confusing drafting, to put it mildly, and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary at least to acknowledge that there is confusion here, and to say that, in the event of our agreeing to withdraw Amendment (o), he
	<span class='label label-info column'>1112</span>
will consider tidying up this whole matter. I do not think there is any dispute between us as to the objective in mind, but there is certainly division as to whether this form of wording is the most impeccable way to achieve the goal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I say I am satisfied that the drafting achieves our objectives, as I described them earlier. I have also said that I am happy to try to help the hon. Gentleman by corresponding with him. Perhaps the best course is for me to say that I will read the report of what he said, and see whether in correspondence I can reassure him about the objectives, which I am glad he understands. The argument is purely about whether the new clause as drafted secures what I have described, and I am very happy to pursue that in correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the tenor of the discussion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment (m), in line 23, leave out from applicants ' to end of line 26 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>' is to become the tenant of the holding, and give a direction entitling that applicant to a tenancy of the holding according to the choice which the landlord may make between those applicants, whom the Tribunal consider to be suitable.'</p></blockquote>
This amendment applies to subsection (6) of new Clause 10, and, as the Parliamentary Secretary told us, that subsection suggests how the tribunal should operate in the event of there being more than one applicant for a tenancy who appears suitable. The tribunal has to decide who is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the more or most suitable person to become the tenant of the holding".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of our amendment is very simple. We take the view—and I do not think this is unreasonable—that if there is more than one applicant the choice should be in the gift of the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without any question, we are taking away a great deal of the landlord's sovereignty over his own land, and it is not unreasonable, when the tribunal has looked at the cases presented to it, to allow the landlord to choose between the applicants. I do not consider that this amendment would open the door to any great abuses, and I do not believe it would create any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1113</span>
more hardship. Many landlords live in close proximity to farms which they own, and, when there is more than one person who is eminently suitable to take over a farm, I do not see why the landlord should not be given the crumb of comfort of being able to choose. It is surely not unreasonable to suggest that a landlord should be allowed to make the final choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, this legislation has caused a great deal of anxiety among landlords throughout the whole country. We have had the example of the letter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) referred this morning and which the Parliamentary Secretary and I have also had from a man who lives very close to where I live, although I do not know him. But that is another example of the hardship and anxiety created by these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, since we put this amendment down, the Government have thought sympathetically about it. I also hope that hon. Members opposite—the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) tries very hard to look upon these matters with fairness—will agree that to give the choice to the landlord, once the tribunal has sorted out who is suitable and eligible, is a small thing to ask. So I hope that the Government will be prepared to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only want to support my hon. Friend in this matter. t is important that, if it is humanly possible, the landlord and tenant should be people who are compatible and who get along together, and this amendment would give an opportunity, in a few cases, for a person who might not even be very well thought of by the tribunal to be appointed as the tenant. This would give an opportunity of choice, and is something which is right. It is wholly wrong that, if he wills it, the tenant can have the choice about who can succeed to his tenancy, above other people who are eligible. In that case, one is giving the choice to the tenant. One ought surely to give the choice to the landlord, and I support the amendment which I believe to be good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to preface my remarks by saying that I expect and hope that these will be relatively rare occurrences. We hope that agreement will be reached within the family as to who should succeed
	<span class='label label-info column'>1114</span>
to a tenancy, or who should apply to the tribunal. Indeed, where agreement was not reached between brothers or near relatives, the tenant farmer himself would be in a position to avoid any differences simply by willing the farm to one of them. But the choice between two or more suitably-qualified applicants to the tenancy will not be a very easy one, and there is obviously a strong case for arguing that the choice should rest with the Agricultural Land Tribunal, which is a well-balanced and impartial body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can quite understand why a landlord should feel that he should be allowed to choose between qualified applicants, and indeed he will have an opportunity to give his views before the tribunal, which will take them into account in reaching a decision. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South West (Mr. Hawkins) shakes his head. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the vast majority of landlords, if this decision were left to them, would take it on wholly defensible and honourable grounds. But hon. Members have to face the fact that all groups and classes have their black sheep, and landlords are not exempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been instances—and I heavily qualify this—where it has been alleged that a landlord's attitude to a prospective tenant has not been coloured by reasonable considerations—for example, there may be strong political differences between the landlord and the prospective tenant. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will know of instances of that happening. Certainly, my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan)—and I am not inviting him to join in—knows of a very famous case where, it was alleged, although this is the kind of allegation that cannot be proved, that the son of a tenant farmer was discriminated against on the basis of his political views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that a significant number of landlords are likely to conduct the choice on that basis, but what we propose will rule out any suspicion of its happening. Indeed, from its past experience, the tribunal will fully recognise the importance of a harmonious relationship between landlord and tenant, and I am confident that it will give due weight to the landlord's own preference for a certain applicant. The whole concept of the scheme
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1115</span>
is one of total justice and this is best seen to be done by the Agricultural Land Tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very disappointing reply from the Parliamentary Secretary. What astonishes me is his blind belief in the infallibility of officialdom. How can he suggest that where two applicants have both been shown to be suitable the tribunal which has perhaps met them for one or two hours, can be in a position to make the right choice, when the landlord will know more about their background and their capacity to farm? I drafted this amendment and was prepared to accept the fallibility of its drafting, but I thought it was one which the Government would accept. I cannot accept the argument that a landlord might decide against an applicant who had different political views,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is, I think a simple drafting amendment which I feel the Government will accept. It deals with the subsection following the one which we discussed in the last debate, subsection (7) to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred then. At present, it suggests that the tribunal shall give the landlord an opportunity to state his views on the suitability of an applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous debate, the Parliamentary Secretary told us that, where there was more than one applicant, the landlord would have an opportunity to state his views. t was the core of his argument that the tribunal would be able to make the choice after hearing what the landlord had to say. As I read the clause, the land-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
	<p>and I do not think it would be likely to happen. The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about a celebrated case, but I have not heard of it.</p>
	<p>However, I feel that so much is being taken away from the landlord that it is reasonable to ask that, where two people are both suitable to farm, he should be able to choose between them, rather than have the choice made for him by a semi-legal body, sitting far away from the holding and having little acquaintance with the nature or capacity of the applicants. In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I can only advise my hon. Friends to join me in voting in favour of this amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i>That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>lord would not have an opportunity to state his views about suitability where, under subsection (6), there was more than one applicant, and that seems totally wrong.</p>
	<p>The case is made by what the Parliamentary Secretary said in the last debate, because he stated then that where there was more than one applicant he would be able to state his views, but under subsection (7) the opportunity to state his views is only allowed where there is one applicant under subsection (2). So it is with a good deal more confidence even than I had in the last debate that I hope the Government will accept this amendment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment (n) goes far wider than is desirable. We have already made a major concession to the landlord's interest by allowing him to give his views on the suitability of each applicant. This is only fair, because if the landlord knows his tenants well—as indeed he ought—he will almost certainly know their close relatives as well, if they have been working alongside the tenant for at least five years in the last seven years. Who better than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
he, therefore, to give an opinion on the suitability of people who are applying to be his tenants and may have a business relationship with him?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal uses normal courtroom procedure. I envisage, therefore, that the landlord will be invited by the tribunal to give his views on the suitability of an applicant when each application is being considered in turn, and he can, of course, be cross-examined on it by the applicant. When all the applications and the landlord's notice to quit have been heard, the tribunal will go into closed session to decide whether or not to make a direction and, if so, in whose favour it is to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where does it say that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be inappropriate, therefore, for the landlord to give further evidence to the tribunal, presumably in the form that he would be prepared to accept X and not accept Y or Z.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, as the landlord is allowed to comment on each applicant, there is nothing to stop him giving his comments in such a way as to make it abundantly clear to the tribunal what his views are on their suitability relative to each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton), suggested that everything I referred to was not made explicit in the new clause. We shall be bringing forward an order to give guidance to the tribunal on that and related matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (p) is also unnecessary. I have already explained in reply to Amendment (o) that subsection (2) sets out the procedure to be adopted as regards a single applicant, and subsection (3) states that if there is more than one applicant the procedure in subsection (2) will be applied to each applicant in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I can assure the Committee that the landlord will be afforded an opportunity to comment on the suitability of the applicant if there is only one applicant or on each applicant in turn if there is more than one applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have met the hon. Member's point. His concern was that the landlord should be able to comment on any applicant before the tribunal. That condition is met in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that this shows the disadvantage one has by not having
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
had a legal training. Perhaps if I had, I might have seen the point a little earlier. I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his explanation. t seems that the point is covered, and in view of that I beg to ask leave to withdraw thc Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment (e), in line 34, leave out or ' and insert ' and'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment brings us back to somewhat familiar ground. We come now to subsection (8), which says what matters the tribunal shall have regard to when sifting applicants who have been brought to it under subsection (2) in the case of one or under subsection (6) where there is a number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph (a) of subsection (8), the tribunal is instructed that it will have regard to the extent to which an applicant or applicants has or have been trained in or have had practical experience of agriculture. I was somewhat alarmed to see that the word "or" is used. I feel that the tribunal should look at the extent to which the applicant or applicants has or have been trained in agriculture and have had practical experience. It would seem wrong that, if there is someone who has done a degree course in agriculture and has had no practical experience of farming, the tribunal should be instructed that it need not look at the practical side of the applicant's experience but may look only at the academic and formal training in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stressed this point earlier, and a number of my hon. Friends commented on the essential nature of practical experience if one is to farm successfully. This is a small but necessary amendment, and I see no good reason why the tribunal should have the option of looking at the extent of an applicant's formal training or merely looking at his practical experience in agriculture. I cannot see any reason why the Government should not accept the amendment, and I hope they will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) in his endeavours to have "or" changed to "and". One interpretation of the words as at present written is that training is given preference over practical experience.The other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1119</span>
interpretation is that both stand on an equal footing. But even if one takes the second alternative, that they stand on an equal footing, even on that most advantageous interpretation, I would argue that that militated decisively against the less-privileged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it can be argued that the least-privileged would have had a lesser opportunity to equip himself or herself with training and would have had practical experience much more to the forefront than training. In terms of age structure it is almost certain, above an age level of 35 to 45, which goes back to the days before the war, that there could be people succeeding now in that age group or up to 50 who had few facilities for training before or during the war, when such facilities were minimal. If these two are to be quoted—training or practical experience—to the certain disadvantage of a potential applicant, it could be taken from the form of words that training should be given by the tribunal some kind of preference or comeuppance over experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very tempted almost to present the same argument at the same length as I did in an earlier debate discussing education and agriculture, but no doubt the Committee wants to continue to make good progress. I have risen to support fully the views and comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling), who seeks to have " or " changed to "and". Bearing in mind the views of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard), that practical experience is the best experience, I feel that the amendment will improve this legislation and particularly this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saying this, I know I have the support of farmers, the NFU, the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs, officials of the Agricultural Training Board and principals of agricultural colleges and institutions. All those people who know a considerable amount about agriculture have, in all their representations to me about these clauses, emphasised the importance of practical experience in agriculture. This subsection is worded
	<br><blockquote><p>"… has been trained in or has had practical experience of agriculture."</p></blockquote>
I cannot understand why the word was not "and" from the start. That is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1120</span>
purport of the amendment. I hope the Minister, in wishing to make progress, to improve the drafting and the ultimate implementation of the legislation, will see his way to meeting a good point from this side which is fully supported by those in agriculture. t is the job of those who are interested in agriculture to improve this Bill, and I fully support the views of my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under subsection (8), the tribunal is required to consider an applicant's agricultural background and experience. This could be either his formal training in agriculture, whether at an agricultural college or under a farm manager. The basis of this argument is the extent to which we give the tribunal freedom to decide these matters. In the Bill, both criteria are deemed to have equal importance, but the relative emphasis the tribunal attaches to them may vary with each case. We give it that flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition would like to narrow the scope of the tribunal so that it concentrated on one of the criteria. This is a fairly evenly-balanced argument, but we have thought about it carefully. We are talking about different types of situations—all the arguments about injustices will still apply—and we have decided that, on balance, the tribunal should be free to decide how much importance to attach to each criterion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the analogy of the horse and cart and which comes first, why is the new clause written in this way? Why is training given preference over practical experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one has two statements, one must follow the other. If we say "A and B" we are not giving "A" preference. In English, one statement must meet the eye before the other. That is the sole significance of the order of the words. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hardly. The Government cannot put the cart before the horse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the Minister's arguments. I even wonder whether we are talking about the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1121</span>
wording. I was astonished to hear him accuse us of seeking to narrow the effect of the subsection. We are trying to extend the consideration that the tribunal will give to the qualities of applicants. As the new clause stands, the tribunal will look either at a person's training or his practical experience. The wording seems to prevent the tribunal looking at both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tribunal may look at both, but is not forced to do so. t has a greater degree of freedom under our suggestion than it would have under the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the way I understand English. The new clause says: "the extent to which the applicant or each of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the applicants has been trained in, or has had practical experience of, agriculture;"</p></blockquote>
Under that wording, the tribunal is precluded from looking at both training and practical experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer the wording to be the other way round, with practical experience coming first. At present, it seems unduly restrictive, and our purpose is to broaden the scope of the tribunal's inquiries and not, as the Parliamentary Secretary claimed in his extraordinary interpretation of the amendment, to narrow the scope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would the Parliamentary Secretary suggest that the tribunal should deal with two applicants, one with certain academic, college or institute training in agriculture, but without practical experience, and another who has completed a period of practical experience on the land is half-way through his college training? The Minister narrows the scope for the tribunal. We are trying to broaden it. The Minister has got it wrong. He should quickly reconsider his attitude and accept the amendment because it would be a considerable improvement to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not got it wrong. To replace "or" with "and" would mean that an applicant would not be regarded as suitable by the tribunal unless he had both formal training and practical experience. That would set a particularly high standard which would not be encountered all that frequently. How many farmers could meet both criteria, desirable though they may be, and how many excellent
	<span class='label label-info column'>1122</span>
young farmers would be regarded as unsuitable because they did not possess both qualifications? We are saying the tribunal should be free to take into account both considerations if it wishes, but that it should not be compelled to do so. That is the legal interpretation I have received of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the Minister. The full rigours of the amendment could undermine the criteria we argued about for so long on new Clause 8, depending on the span of years which " and " would embrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I feel some disquiet that the word "or" could make the two qualifications, at one extreme, mutually exclusive and, at the other, alternatives. The Minister's interpretation is the latter, but once this Bill becomes an Act, he can talk until he is blue in the face and it will count for nothing. What will count is what is written in the Act and how it is interpreted by the courts. We must apply ourselves to ensuring that the Minister's interpretation is the correct one and that this provision is not interpreted as meaning that the qualifications are mutually exclusive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful this morning. I am prepared to take on board the point made by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stain-ton). If necessary, we shall ensure in subsequent advice to the tribunal that there can be no misunderstanding on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That undertaking goes a long way towards meeting our case, and I hope the Minister will bear in mind that the wording has confused us. He has said that, according to his legal advice, this provision goes wider than we thought, and that helps to satisfy those of us who are not lawyers. He has also said he will give instructions to the tribunal making the effect of paragraph (	<i>a</i>)wider than we have read it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been somewhat alarmed by the wording of this clause, which appears to have been badly drafted in a number of respects. Statutes should be as readily understandable as possible, and too many anomalies seem to have crept into the new clause, causing arguments about what is meant by the words. Perhaps the Minister will look at these matters again
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
with a view to bringing forward amendment ments at a later stage. In view of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment (1), in line 35, leave out paragraph (b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we are to discuss Amendment (a), in line 37, after ' landlord ', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'which shall be disclosed to the applicant or applicants'.</p></blockquote>
and Amendment (b), in line 38, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'and an opportunity for a reply be provided'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Iwill deal with Amendments (a) and (b) first. They are attempts to safeguard tenants and provide that they should know what information a landlord has given to atribunal and should also have the right to reply to that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the tribunal is to meet in public, and I assume that this information would be available to the tenant. Amendment (a) would therefore be unnecessary, but I am anxious that the tenant should have a right of reply. t may be that Amendment (b) is also unnecessary, and if the Minister can assure me that tenants' rights in this respect will be protected, I will not press Amendments (a) and (b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:Would the hon. Member care to develop his argument, however briefly, to cover the question of privilege surrounding comments made by either party before the tribunal in what would be an open public meeting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, but I am not a lawyer and Ishall have to rely on the Minister to deal with it. I am not concerned so much about privilege as about secret information passed to the tribunal, for instance, in the form of references.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put down the amendments before I knew the tribunal would meet in public, but if any secret information is to be passed to the tribunal, the tenant has a right to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1124</span>
know what is said. I look forward to my hon. Friend's comments on that. On amendment (1) I have referred to such qualifications as health and financial standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that this paragraph should be removed, because I am not clear what is meant by the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>…the Tribunal shall have regard to all relevant matters including… the age, physical health and financial standing of the applicant …"</p></blockquote>
For example, what is the criterion for judging the age of physical health of the applicant? The Government require employers to take 3 per cent. of their work force from registered disabled persons. Are we saying here that no farmer shall do so? Are we to lock out the disabled person? Surely, this is a matter of commonsense and it is a question of whether or not a man is able to carry out the work. Why should we include something so vague, or put in such stiff criteria?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I am not clear what is meant by "financial standing". How much money should an applicant have available. Should he be credit-worthy? Ido not know what is meant by that term. This may be a great general provision that the tribunal should look at these points, but I feel some further guidance should be given. Legislation should not be left in this general form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should look at subsection (8) again. It says—and to some extent he seems to be unaware of this, although he referred obliquely to it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the Tribunal shall have regard to all relevant matters …"</p></blockquote>
It is not said that because an applicant is of a certain age, is handicapped or has not a certain financial status he should be denied the tenancy. It merely states that the tribunal shall have regard to these things in considering applicants for a tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:My major point in raising this as a probing amendment was to get further information from the Minister on what he feels the tribunal should be looking for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:One of the worrying things about establishing criteria which it is said should be included is that that leads to the exclusion of other criteria. Criteria A,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1125</span>
B & C may be mentioned, but there may be many other criteria which ought to be taken into account. This arose earlier, particularly when we were discussing the criteria of agricultural experience and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how relevant the health and financial standing of an applicant should be. We have looked at the case where there may be brothers, both of whom are in their sixties, where there is a general family understanding that when one brother ceases to farm the other brother may by age be barred from the normal succession as envisaged under this Bill. The question of physical health may be relevant in the sense that the widow may succeed and become the tenant but her son will run the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, it will be the son who will be doing the active physical work on the farm. The widow, although she may be handicapped or physically unfit for some other reason, may be perfectly capable of playing a management role. But as soon as we include this provision the agricultural Land Tribunal will say, " This provision must have been included for some good reason, and although the widow may be perfectly capable of managing the farm, she is physically incapable of running it." I feel that this is entirely against the principle of the Bill itself. It cuts right across the question of financial standing and introduces a dangerous specification. Secondly, I doubt the value—and indeed I see the dangers—of making specifications at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), it is absolutely right that where allegations of one kind or another have been made, these views should be made known in advance of the public hearing so that the tenant can be prepared to meet them if necessary. I hope that we shall get satisfactory answers or at any rate a response which will lead to changes being made at a further stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dealing first with Amendments (a) and (b), I sympathise with my hon. Friend's intentions and I agree entirely that the applicant must know what views the landlord gives to the tribunal as to his suitability to become the tenant of the holding, and that, furthermore, the applicant must be allowed an opportunity to reply to the landlord's statement. These are matters of elementary
	<span class='label label-info column'>1126</span>
and common justice, and it would be intolerable if the applicant had no such rights. I am pleased to reassure my hon. Friend on both points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proceedings of the tribunal, which are generally similar to those in court, are governed by rules made by the Lord Chancellor under the Agricultural Land Tribunals and Notices to Quit Order 1959, as amended. Evidence before the tribunal may be given orally or by affidavit if the parties to the proceedings consent, or by means of written statements produced by the maker when giving oral evidence. If evidence is tendered in the form of a written statement, copies of the statement are to be made available at the hearing to the other parties. So any views stated to the tribunal by the landlord will be known to the applicant or his representative at the hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All witnesses, including the parties, are liable to examination, cross-examination and re-examination in the normal way. If evidence is given by an affidavit or by any other written statement which is admitted by the tribunal, the tribunal may order the attendance of the person making the affidavit or statement for examination and cross-examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to Amendment (1), we feel it would be wrong to provide a further right of succession to a tenancy by someone who had not the ability to farm the land well and make a satisfactory tenant. It would not be in anyone's interest to do so—neither the landlord's nor the applicant's—and it would be contrary to the national economic interest, which requires the most efficient production of food. Age, physical health and financial standing have a direct bearing on whether the applicant is likely to make a success of the holding. We have not sought to impose rigid requirements, as it would be wholly inappropriate to do so. Each case must be decided on its own merits and particular circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of the age factor is obvious. To take an extreme case, if a father dies at 90, leaving a son in his late sixties, clearly the son would have no future as a farming tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He might have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The importance of physical health will vary from farm to farm. A farmer must be sufficiently well and active to carry out the work entailed. Except
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1127</span>
on the largest farms, the tenant will be a working farmer out in all weathers for long hours doing heavy physical work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The applicant's financial standing is particularly important, since he must have enough capital to run the business in order to make a living. Flow much money he will need depends on the size and type of farm and the standard of fixed equipment which is available on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I emphasise that my Friend the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) would be under a false impression if he thought that the insertion of these criteria in the Bill would have a major effect in relation to the achievement of our objective of eliminating hardships. At the end of the day, at the final stage when the landlord seeks to obtain a notice to quit—and this is the critical matter in relation to agriculture—the "fair and reasonable landlord" test will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to my hon. Friend, although I was not aware of this until I looked at it, that age, health and the financial standing of an applicant are also matters for consideration in Scotland. These criteria will in no way effect my hon. Friend's theories. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and my hon. Friend will know, as I do, that they do not affect the intentions he had when, as a Minister at the Scottish Office, he was legislating on this. If I thought for a moment that this would cut across our scheme and effectively lead to a significant number of reasonable applicants being excluded, I would be for removing it, but I have no fear on that score.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to accept that codes of practice should be published. I would feel much happier if my hon. Friend would consider issuing guidelines to the Agricultural Land Tribunal because I believe that they would be most helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend to consider removing subsection (8), or most of it. When we write these provisions on age and health into legislation, with the passage of time they are seen as rigid criteria. There may be a 90-year-old farmer with a 70-year-old son, but the latter's son, who may be only 40, will be the effective farmer. There may be various family reasons why the farm should not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1128</span>

There is no point in referring to physical health in relation to doing heavy farming when a widow, although not capable of doing the work herself, has a son able to do it. The proper succession should be to the widow, although it will be known that her son will be doing the hard work on the farm.

I confess that the wording of the clause has caused a certain confusion in my mind. The purpose of this amendment is to try to unravel the difference between a suitable person and an eligible person. As I understand it, the general definition of an eligible person is the type of person we discussed when we were debating new Clause 8.
