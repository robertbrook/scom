	<section>
	<div class='title'>AGRICULTURAL HOLDINGS IN ENGLAND AND WALES: POWER TO ENABLE NOTICES TO DO WORK TO BE MODIFIED ON ARBITRATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we were so unhappily interrupted on Tuesday, I was in course of moving Amendment No. 78, in page 13, line 32, leave out second or " and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and (ii) by substituting such longer period of time for the time specified in the notice in which the work is to be done as he thinks reasonable in all the circumstances; or".</p></blockquote>
It would, perhaps, be helpful if I were to repeat what I said about the amendment. I said that the amendment was part of the philosophy of the amendments we have tabled on the clause, and is in line with the thoughts that I propounded in proposing the first few amendments on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pointed out that, once the period which a tenant has been given to comply with a notice to remedy or to do work has expired, the landlord is entitled to serve a notice to quit where the tenant has failed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the law stands, and in this respect Clause 11 would not alter the position, it is possible for the tenant to oppose the notice to quit, even if he admits he has failed to comply with a notice to remedy on the grounds that the notice gave insufficient time in which to do the work or to remedy the breach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of fairness between landlord and tenant, it is more equitable that an arbitrator should judge the reasonableness of the time specified, presumably after having seen the condition of the farm, soon after the service of the notice. It must therefore follow that the tenant would be debarred from challenging the resonableness of the time at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>546</span>
At present Article 13 of the Notices to Remedy and Notices to Quit Order gives the arbitrator powers to extend the period for complying with a notice, but this power can be used only at the arbitration on the notice to quit. It is not intended that the amendment should take away the protection from the tenant. However, it is a matter which certainly should be looked at, and if the Government are proposing any sort of review of the Order, the purpose of the amendment is to draw their attention to the situation in the hope that the amendment, if not acceptable today in its present drafted form, will be subsequently written in to the new Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, of course, a highly technical and legal point, but I am sure that the Minister appreciates that the amendments we have tabled follow a certain line of thought which I think he will agree is designed to bring greater fairness into the arbitration procedure. I hope and believe that both sides of the Committee will accept that it is my intention to try to make what is a crucially important matter in the life of a tenant, and in some cases the life of a landlord, be seen to be as fair as the British people can make it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret not having been present at the previous Sitting. I was sitting on another Committee dealing with much the same sort of matter. The Committee room was not even next door to this room, but down in the bowels of the earth, and I could not move rapidly from one to the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bowels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the remarks of my hon. Friend will be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a few general remarks on arbitrators, as I was one for a considerable number of years. The motto of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers is "Do what is right, come what may." That is the way we set about our business. I can assure hon. Members that it is not an easy job to try to produce a fair judgment on something which could affect the liveli-hood—indeed, the very existence—of a farmer and his family or, for that matter, a landlord who, in certain circumstances, has even greater hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one case in which I took part, one side was trying to get hack land from the tenant for the landlord, who was in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>547</span>
a much smaller way than the tenant. The tenant had something like 14,000 acres and the landlord had very little land in hand at all. The question concerned some 300 acres which lay right in the landlord's own home farm. It is no easy task to arbitrate in these matters and it involves a great deal of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arbitrators, unlike what many hon. Members hinted at on Second Reading, are not lightly chosen. One has a valuer for the tenant and a valuer for the landlord, and if they cannot agree they will endeavour to choose someone in the profession who is well known, who is probably not in the immediate district, whose judgment they can rely upon, and whose findings can be accepted as final by the landlord's representative and the tenant's representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the landlord and the tenant cannot agree, the Lord Chancellor has a panel of arbitrators, of which I was a member for a time. The Lord Chancellor, having had recommendations from professional bodies, the National Farmers' Union, the tenant's and the landlord's representatives, has a panel of people from whom he chooses someone for the particular arbitration. I can assure the Committee that choosing an arbitrator is not done lightly and is something that is usually agreed between the landlord and the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) had quite the wrong idea of the way in which arbitrators go to work when he said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we should put ourselves in the position of an arbitrator, sitting in some cold and draughty place, usually a pub, I gather, debating with the two parties present the finer points of someone's livelihood."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C;</i> 10th February 1976,	<i>c.</i> 530.]</p></blockquote>
As a general rule, the arbitrator is as keen on his creature comforts as the landlord's representative and the tenant's representative, and he will not choose a cold and draughty place in which to meet. In fact, a pub is often the warmest place in which the meeting could be held. The arbitrator does not debate with the two parties the finer points of someone's livelihood. He sits and listens and, of course, asks questions, but I doubt whether he enters into any debate and, indeed, I think that it would he wrong
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>548</span>
if he were to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend accept my wholehearted apologies for any aspersions that I have cast on the judgment of arbitrators in choosing cold and draughty places? I did not by using the word "debating" mean it in the sense which my hon. Friend is reading into it. I merely use it in terms of the fact that this is an arbitration held between two parties in privateand, therefore, in his capacity the arbitrator would intervene to ask judicial questions, but I did not mean "debating" in the terms which my hon. Friend has just given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I of course thank my hon. Friend. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is true that arbitrators are almost never lawyers"—OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee</i> C; 10th February 1976, 	<i>c.</i> 530.]</p></blockquote>
In the arbitrations in which I have taken place they never have been, and I do not know whether they can be. I do not know whether the Lord Chancellor's panel of arbitrators contains any lawyers for particular cases which affect the Agricultural Holdings Act or matters to do with agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that if an arbitrator feels that a point of law is to be raised—he will probably see from the statements of case that a major point of law will be brought up—he has the right to sit with a lawyer. He asks both sides whether they are likely to be represented by solicitors or counsel and, if he finds that they are being represented, he would be stupid not to sit with a lawyer himself who can advise him on the legal points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took part in one of the biggest marathons of arbitration which took place at the Chartered Surveyors Institution. It lasted nine days spread over two months. A former Lord Chancellor, Lord Gardiner, was one of the advocates on one side, which was a great experience for me, I can assure hon. Members. However, T want to stress that it is not so much listening to the evidence of the expert witnesses and the arguments which one listens to, but—this is a point in this particular instance—the inspection of the holding that is a major part of the arbitrator's job. He would not give any judgment over any of these matters without inspecting the holding and making sure that he had seen for himself all the points at issue on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>549</span>
holding, and he is chosen for his capacity to deal with these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to quote from a letter from the Agricultural Law Association. It is a small body. Perhaps hon. Members have received a copy of the letter dated 12th December. The members of that organisation who wrote were Anthony Cripps, Christopher Harwood, J. Muir Watt and John Plume. The letters refers to Clauses 11 and 12, and the point that it makes as a general matter—the point I want to make—is that unless we are very careful Clauses 11 and 12 will greatly disadvantage smaller and family farmers because they
	<br><blockquote><p>"would increase the technical and procedural complications, the time and money spent on hearings, and the delay in obtaining a final result.… This will greatly disadvantage the smaller and family farmers who can ill-afford the present time, money and delays, and will put anyone with greater means and better professional advice in an even stronger position than now to wear down his opposite number. A farmer may already have to go through three separate hearings (first on notice to do work, second on notice to quit, with a third in time extension case)and he may not know the final answer for a year or two, during which he is less inclined to put as much as he otherwise would into his farming, the landlord is unable to plan ahead, and the farm inevitably deteriorates."</p></blockquote>
Clause 12 introduces a possible fourth hearing. We have not come to that yet, but they are interlinked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clauses 11 and 12 are a 'tinkering about' with Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) when what is needed is a fundamental and constructive overhaul to remove far more striking injustices than are touched by these Clauses (or the Amendment)."</p></blockquote>
The Association goes into details of the injustices to which it refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever we do with Clauses 11 and 12 let us not make this a long drawn out procedure, thus making it far more expensive for the tenant farmer and everybody connected with agriculture. and losing the country a lot of good food in the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend say how costs are apportioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having a little difficulty relating this to the amendment. It seems more appropriate to the "clause stand part" debate. Can the hon. Gentleman relate it to the specific
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>550</span>
amendment or reserve his remarks for "clause stand part".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This refers to Clauses 11 and 12, Mr. Costain, and if you would prefer it I will refer directly to Amendment No. 78. However, to answer my hon. Friend's question about costs, as a general rule costs follow the event, but, of course, it is up to the arbitrator to decide. However, a county court can decide whether costs have been too much or too little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the amendment is that it should be fair between landlord and tenant. I believe that we are trying to cut out one of the stages—which will, through delays, result in a deterioration of the whole thing—by trying to put the arbitrator into a position to be able to judge the reasonableness of the time specified after seeing the condition of the farm soon after the service of the notice. In other words, I believe that an arbitrator can lay down a time which is reasonable. The arbitrator should be given this time, and he generally leansover backwards to make the time as long as possible. He realises the length of time that local builders take to do jobs, the scarcity of different types of materials, whether the job is one which is likely to be done by the tenant of the farm or whether he will have to employ a major contractor or small builder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it would save everybody's time if the arbitrator were empowered, as the amendment would empower him, to look at the state of the farm soon after the service of the notice to quit. It would follow, of course, that the tenant would be debarred from challenging the reasonableness of the time at a later stage. I believe this to be right. It would save an enormous amount of time. The arbitrator is the right person to set the time limit. One knows that if one has an aching tooth which gets better, one is rather inclined to delay going to the dentist Therefore, I believe that, unless a time limit is fixed within which the work is to be done, time will drag on and a little bit will be done now and then instead of setting about the work straight away and finishing the job within a reasonable time limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that part of the Notices to Remedy and Notices to Quit Order gives
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>551</span>
the arbitrator powers to extend the period for complying with the notice. But this power can be used only at the time of arbitration on the notice to quit. It is not intended that the amendment should take his protection from the tenant. It is a method of speeding up the processes which already are long drawn out. As the Agricultural Law Association said, the time could easily run into two or three, years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore beg the Minister to think carefully about the amendment, and any other amendments aimed at simplifying and speeding up the processes and getting a matter over and done with. It is in no spirit of unreasonableness that I support the amendment. I do so in the interests of the landlord and the tenant together, and in the interests of the farming of the land and the production of food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too sure that I understand the reasoning behind the arguments so far. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) supports the amendment, yet the amendment talks about more time being devoted to a job, whereas he was pressing the point that the process should be speeded up. May we have clarification of the issue, because I see a great deal of merit in the amendment, certainly for an arbitrator to have more power to see' that sensible decisions are arrived at?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I simply explained at the outset that this is not so much an anti-harassment amendment as an amendment to the general procedure for arbitration on notices to do work. Its effect would be to enable an arbitrator on a notice to do work to extend the time allowed if he considers it reasonable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, however, like to make the point, particularly to my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick), as I have already explained in reply to an earlier amendment, that an arbitrator can extend the time at the first arbitration on the tenant's request if he considers it reasonable to do so. His powers to do so are set out in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>552</span>
Article 6 of the Agriculture (Notices to Remedy and Notices to Quit) Order 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, necessary under the terms of Section 24(2)(	<i>d</i>) of the Agricultural Holdings Act1948, for a landlord to specify a reasonable period of time for doing the work when drawing up his notice. If the reasonableness of the period so specified is challenged by the tenant, this question, and hence the basic validity of a notice, must be settled by the arbitrator one way or the other. But what an arbitrator cannot do is retrospectively to make valid a notice in which the landlord originally specified an unreasonable period of time by substituting a different period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that it is not possible to ensure in all circumstances that the question of reasonableness of time is settled at the notice to do the work stage. A tenant may not go to arbitration at all at that stage. Therefore, he cannot be deprived of the right to raise the question on an arbitration on the notice to quit. In practice, however, most tenants are likely to require arbitration on the notice to do work itself, in which case a challenge by the tenant on the question of time must be made at that stage also. If not then made, it cannot he raised later, which is dealt with in Article 5(3) of the Agriculture (Notices to Remedy and Notice to Quit) Order 1964.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a highly technical matter, because, frankly, the powers are there for the arbitrator to modify the time. The important factor which concerns us—I dealt with it at some length in earlier proceedings—is that we must recognise that there will be circumstances where, due to unforeseen events, the tenant will be unable to complete all the work. I explained that matter. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) was not here at the time, but I am sure that he has plenty of experience of these matters. A contractor may not have turned up, or a serious illness befell a tenant, and the tenant may have been unable to comply with what seemed a, reasonable time given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fairly technical matter, and I can tell the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West that we have had a great deal f help from the association of which the hon. Gentleman is a member, the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers. We consulted the Association
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>553</span>
on the amendments and its advice was invaluable. The Association strongly supports both Clauses 11 and 12. I confess that I do not see how the amendment will simplify the procedure. As I see it, there is no alternative to the tenant having to serve counter-notices on the landlord at various stages. The purpose of the clauses is basically to enable a degree of common sense. The hon. Member himself implied that in his speech. It is to prevent landlords from using unreasonable means and forcing tenants to do unreasonable tasks as a means of getting them out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the amendment is designed to help the landlord, but, in my view, there is little scope for the operation of it and, accordingly, I do not consider that it is necessary. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept at face value the Minister's explanation. There is a difference of opinion within the industry and the advisers on the amendment. The National Farmers' Union has put forward a point to me that the amendment is fundamentally the same as the Parliamentary Secretary's comments. Therefore, it would not be my intention to press the matter, subject to what myhon. Friends have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his short reply the Parliamentary Secretary said something about Clause 12. Although I do not intend to pursue the matter any further, I must check with the hon. Gentleman that he said that the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers was in favour in Clause 12. In due courseI shall argue vehemently against Clause 12, because I believe that there are better ways of carrying out the Government's intentions. Most of the professional advice that I have received, including that from the chartered surveyors, is that Clause 12 is both unnecessary and expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is all so very esoteric, heady, stuff as far as I am concerned, as I am sure it is to some hon. Members opposite. What we should like spelt out—I am sure we join hands on this—are the various stages, and the power of the arbitrator at those various stages to vary. We have been talking in subsection (1) about deleting items, and, other matters being equal, it would follow from that that a shorter time-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>554</span>
scale would apply. It may not have arisen by that time. I do not know. However, there is a duty on both the spokesman for the Opposition and on the Parliamentary Secretary to get this in to the heads of members of the Committee, however thick they are. I do not understand the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will probably come as no great comfort to my hon. Friend for me to tell him that I have a lengthy brief from which I propose to address the Committee in the "Clause stand part" debate, in order to enlighten the Committee. Unhappily, it is a matter which would have been somewhat easier if we could have debated clause stand part" before we started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is for the convenience of the Committee, I am prepared to accept a wider debate on the amendment and have no "clause stand part" debate. If that is the Committee's wish, it will help to make the matter clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think, Mr. Costain, if other hon. Members agree, that it would be better if we stick to the arrangements already started, in that we are first dealing with some of the minor points and shall then have a wide ranging debate on "clause stand part". There are both technical and political matters we shall wish to debate when we come to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must stick to the minor points, then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be wise to stick to the minor points. As the Minister mentioned this particular theme, I shall wish to check up on it. I am sure that he will. I suspect that the professional advisers who handle the actual carrying out of agricultural law do have considerable reservations about Clause 12.

prepare for the enlightment of the Committee, or deposit in the Library, a memorandum on precisely how this situation will work. I am sure that that would meet with the support of all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel very heavy-hearted saying farewell to an amendment such as this without being properly enlightened thereon. It is not that I have failed to prime myself, but I think that the various spokesmen have not directed their remarks all too clearly this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers—I think I have paid my subscription. I am also a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. I have had no notice from the CAAV headquarters on this matter, but I have heard from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The opinion of the agricultural committee—most of the members of which are arbitrators—of that institution is that it would be in the interest of fairness between landlord and tenant to allow the arbitrator to look into the question at the beginning instead of later as this would prevent delay. That is why I pushed the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to add one other thing: even if there were only one case of harassment a year I would support any clause that did away with it or lessened the opportunity for it. There is nothing worse than when people from outside the ordinary agricultural interests buy up land with the idea of trying to get rid of the tenant and then sell with vacant possession. It must happen on odd occasions and the people who do it go after every form of notice in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I support the purpose behind Clause 11. My only worry is that I have seen the expense that is occasioned these days to tenants and landlords and seen the deterioration of the holding. The Minister must look carefully at this matter and set out to his own satisfaction the stages through which the landlord and tenant would have to go. I think this should be put down so that we may see how the matter could be delayed and dragged out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be very happy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>556</span>
to supply the note which the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) has requested. I am tempted briefly to go over the procedure, to show what it involves and how it works, but I think it would be better to wait until the "clause stand part" debate. But I should make the point that these are technical and narrow amendments. The effect of this amendment is very fine and I suggest that it is open to argument. Powers already exist, and I say that having gone into the matter in some detail with professional people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 55, in page 13, line 37, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the arbitrator shall, if he deletes any item or part of an item or substitutes a different method or material, include in his award his reasons for so doing".</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that our amendments are narrow and finely tuned. I do not argue with that statement in any way. But this amendment has some merit over some of the others in that I, at least, can understand it and, I suspect, most members of the Committee will be able to understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a common complaint—I have certainly heard it in the agricultural world—that arbitrators frequently give no reasons for their decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very wise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And parties feel aggrieved when there is no apparent reason for a decision against their interest. Where, as here, an arbitrator is to be given the power to delete or modify obligations, it is all the more important that it can be seen to have been done for good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, if an item is deleted from a notice to do work—for example, to paint woodwork—it will be important for the parties to know why. They will want to know whether the arbitrator thought that the item of fixed equipment should be declared redundant, or whether the painting should be postponed to another year, or whatever reason. If an item is deleted without explanation, neither party will know what the tenant is expected to do about it in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the interjection of my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>557</span>
Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins)—an interjection presumably based on his lengthy experience as an arbitrator—that arbitrators are very wise not to give reasons for their decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that Mr. Speaker also occasionally feels very glad that the Standing Orders do not allow him to give reasons for some of his decisions. Of course, it is much easier when there is a difficult problem to be resolved not to have to justify the decision. One knows this from experience in one's own life when dealing with matters infinitely less important than arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that the amendment makes a fair point. It may be that the discipline required of an arbitrator to give reasons will make him concentrate the harder on what he is doing. Although there is no suggestion in the amendment that the parties concerned should then have the opportunity to argue against the reasons, which I am certain my hon. Friend would say would be unacceptable, it is merely that for the future, and presumably in the interests of others who may be concerned in the future, it is fair to ask for an arbitrator to give his reasons at an arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am very glad that the meaning of the amendment is clear. My interjection did not so much refer to these particular matters. I can see no objection to an arbitrator being asked to put in the reasons why he considers, for example, that certain repairs to buildings should not be done. In fact, I would support this. My interjection was on the broader basis that, if one can only leave it so that both parties are thoroughly dissatisfied with one's award—or if they are both satisfied, which is very unlikely to happen—one has probably done the fair thing between both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that this would be of assistance, as we are starting on a new venture which the clause brings in of enabling an arbitrator to have considerable powers. It is a matter which exercises the profession greatly. They are worried about their having powers, as it were, to alter the contract: a contract which both parties have freely entered into at the beginning of a tenancy. I believe both landlord and tenant should he far more careful about what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>558</span>
they sign, as should we all when going about our daily business, than they often are. I should not puff for my profession, but I believe that any tenant entering into an agreement should have the advice of someone who is knowledgeable in these matters and can advise him as to what he is letting himself in for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it would be of help for future arbitrations, possibly, if it were set out as to why an arbitrator had said that certain repairs to certain buildings not necessary for the particular type of farming now carried on were not likely to be necessary for the future. I hope that this principle will not be widened any further in any other matters, because I believe that this leads to an enormous amount of wrangling. As with Mr. Speaker's powers, it is far better that the arbitrator need not give his reasons for everything. However, in this particular instance I support my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what has been said by my hon. Friends the Members for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) and for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). I do so with some resistance, however, because it is some years since I practised at the Bar and was called upon to give advice on agricultural law. However, my memory is strong enough to know that we are blessed with many confident and able arbitrators from whom we expect a great deal. Indeed, almost invariably they discharge their functions with considerable skill and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause will require arbitrators to do something which they ought not to be called upon to do namely, to bring about the breaking of a contract. This is a very serious matter. It is so serious that I think it right that we should on this occasion call upon the arbitrator to give his reasons for so doing. It is important when one is giving a judgment that one should at least have in one's own mind the reason for doing something which is as essentially radical as the breach of a contract must be. It is not for nothing that even in the simplest county court actions judges must not give their judgment without giving their reasons publicly, so that both parties can understand exactly how the judge's mind working and thereby be reassured that their case has been considered properly and fully. The same principle, I should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>559</span>
have thought, should apply here, in the kind of case in which both parties have agreed to a contract and that contract is to be broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the matter sympathetically. I know that we may be departing from precedent, or putting more on the poor arbitrators than they would perhaps wish to have, but on this occasion I think that the profession would welcome the suggestion, and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, hope that we shall have from the Government a helpful reply to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debates on Clause 11 my mind has been going back a good many years. As my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) knows, my father was in the profession and acted as an arbitrator. If I had followed my father in his business, I might have found myself, not in this place today, but as an arbitrator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know, Mr. Costain, one does not have to spend more than a few years knocking about the Standing Committees that deal with various agricultural pieces of legislation, as my hon. Friends the Members for Norfolk, South-West and for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) have during the past 11 years or so, without getting to know a good deal about each other. I remember that on one famous occasion my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West told us—I think it was in a Standing Committee—that he had always wanted to be a farmer, but his father had said to him "My boy, I have not the money and you have not the brains". Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So be a Tory MP.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that to have become a successful arbitrator, as we all know my hon. Friend has done, he must have had a great deal more brain than his father credited him with. It is clear to me that arbitration is a more highly complicated profession than even I, who have known about it all my life, ever thought it was. I think that there was a time when arbitrators were rather jealous of their right not to give reasons in matters of this sort. I am sure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>560</span>
that no one would suggest that there is anything particularly wrong in not giving reasons. Indeed, in the House of Commons we empower Mr. Speaker to give certain decisions and not to give reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sort of case we are discussing, however, where changes are being made in contracts openly entered into, I think that it is right. We are moving into a position in which the powers we are giving under the clause are unusual. —[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—Gasps from the Minister are all very well, but these are very unusual powers. We are giving to an arbitrator the power to break a contract that was freely entered into. If that is done, it is a fundamental step. I submit that it is essential that we know the reasons for such changes being made. It is a step which I think all of us hesitate to take, namely, to allow these powers to be given. In view of that, it is essential that it be done in as open a way as possible. I consider Amendment No. 55 to be an essential step down this road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support everything that has been said by my hon. Friends from the Opposition benches. I apologise for having had to go out during part of the debate, but a telephone call came through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that arbitration has been the hallmark of successive Governments, although unfortunately in too many cases confrontation has resulted from arbitration. But I believe that the trend of modern government is towards more open government, which must be seen to be done. As my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) said, if decisions which are reached basically breach a contract made in the past, the reasons for the breach of that contract should be clearly laid down. My hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) put his finger on the point when he drew attention to certain legal matters that are tied up with the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the amendment. I submit that it will be helpful and, although I do not wish to hark back to previous clauses, I believe that the decisions that will be made will be seen to be that much more reasonable if the amendment is accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to inform the

Committee that it is already the case that an arbitrator under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948, appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, may be required by either of the parties to give reasons for his award. This is provided for by the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971, which deals generally with the obligations in this respect of arbitrators under the direct supervision of the Council on Tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of an arbitrator appointed by agreement between a landlord and his tenant, it is open to the parties to agree also that the arbitrator shall give reasons, if required, for the making of his award. There should therefore be no difficulty for a party to an arbitration, who desires to obtain a statement of the reasons for the award, in obtaining such a statement. But to compel arbitrators appointed by agreement to give reasons would require an amendment to the Tribunals and Inquiries Act. This would be beyond the scope of the Bill. I hope that the hon. Member will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a good enough explanation in this case. Here we are trying to alter the Agricultural Holdings Act in one way or another, bit by bit, which is a totally wrong approach in my opinion and in fact is the main premise for the arguments on Clauses11 and 12 and any other part of the Bill pertaining to the subject. I submit that this is the wrong way to do it. The Agricultural Holdings Act has been waiting for years and years to be amended, and all Governments have failed in their duty to do so. As the letter from the Agricultural Law Association says—I am sure that the Minister has seen it—there are many matters which ought to be dealt with. But because we are amending various items here, and because this proposal can be done by the free will of both parties, that means that probably that will not be done. The parties may not be able to agree upon an arbitrator. I suggest that the provision should be written in if it is to be done at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely we are always amending Acts and we seem to be able to do it pretty successfully, and as we appear to be amending the Agricultural Holdings Act I do not see why the Tribunals and Inquiries Act cannot be so amended. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>562</span>
believe it to be essential. The more I have listened to the arguments the more I believe that. Moreover, I believe it to be wholly wrong to have dealt with this matter in this Bill at all, in a piecemeal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe it will add immense difficulties to these matters, particularly when I think of the large number of Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bills whose Committees I have sat on—I believe the number is four—since I have been in Parliament, which is 11 years, and the odd way in which we have altered bits and pieces of agricultural legislation. Such piecemeal changes add up to a great cause of trouble for any adviser to landlord or tenant, legal or otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, if we are to do it. as we clearly are, then we should make the suggested provision compulsory on the arbitrator, even if it means amending some other Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) in what he said. I should have refreshed my memory on the subject because I used to be quite familiar with it. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will concur, unless my memory is wholly at fault, that an arbitrator can be required to give his reasons, but that is when a party, after having heard the award, feels dissatisfied and wishes to take the matter further, as he may and usually can, to another tribunal. It is then that the arbitrator can go home, or perhaps he has already returned to his offices in some market town. and settle down to writing out his reasons which are duly transmitted to the aggrieved party who has lost the arbitration. Weeks may elapse before those reasons are on the table of the aggrieved party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to have, not that self-justification kind of reasoning, but reasoning that leads up to the conclusion that an award should be on one side or the other—in other words, something in the nature of a judgment in a matter so radical as this. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm that what I have said is right, that we are not asking for the arbitrator to give the kind of reason that he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Parliamentary Secretary amplify what he said about the Council on, Tribunals? He said that we could not have the amendment because it would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>563</span>
conflict with the law as it now stands? Surely, if an arbitrator wishes to give reasons he may do so. Most arbitrators do. If informally it is said to an arbitrator before a case begins that it is a matter of importance and he is invited to give his reasons, he can and does. All the amendment seeks to do is require the arbitrator to do something which he can do if he so wishes, and which he may well do if the parties wish. Am I not right in saying that? If I am, how on earth can we have the advice which we have just had from the Parliamentary Secretary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think hon. Members are fair. There is a distinction perhaps between the type of justification to which I was referring and reasons given on request. Perhaps that is what hon. Members are seeking. However, I must confess that I had not appreciated it earlier. I will undertake to look at the matter again. However, as I have indicated, what the Opposition are seeking is something which goes wider than the scope of the Bill as drafted. Obviously, we can amend any law we like with an Act of Parliament, but this obviously raises a fairly wide issue in that we shall be requiring an arbitrator on every occasion he issues an arbitration award to give a full statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has that wrong on this occasion. The arbitrator has a schedule of items which the tenant is being asked to do—repair the roof of the barn, put five more tiles back, and so on, mend the wall of something, which in Suffolk may easily be a mud wall or clay lump, and he may say that he does not consider that the building is worth repairing and strikes it out. This is something which is clear cut. It relates entirely to the schedule which the landlord has requested the tenant to do by notice. Let us suppose that there are 20 repairs to one building and the arbitrator says that this building is no longer needed for the holding. I believe that it is of advantage to all parties for the arbitrator to do this.

	<p>Secretary said that the arbitrator would have to give reasons for everything. I hope that the amendment relates entirely to the schedule which we are discussing.

I am simply referring to the way in which we do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have undertaken to look at the matter before Report. The point I was trying to make was not that the change would affect everything, but that it would break new ground. It would not mean amending only that Act. It is an important new principle and there may be other instances in other legislation where the principle is equally valid. That does not mean that we should not make the change here, and I shall certainly consider the whole matter. I do not think hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that, again, the point is relatively simple to grasp. It may be argued that it is unlikely that an arbitrator will make an award that runs contrary to statutory provision, but we feel that the amendment may slightly improve the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the clause as drafted would empower an arbitrator—once the Lord Chancellor's order was made—to delete from a notice to do work items which were included by reason of the tenant, in breach of tenancy, failing to comply with statutory obligations, such as those required by the Safety, Health and Welfare Regulations or the Agriculture (Maintenance, Repair and Insurance of Fixed Equipment) Regulations, which lay down what Parliament has thought proper. It is questionable whether it is a proper function for a single arbitrator to amend contractual obligations at all, but it is certainly not a proper function for him to modify the performance of statutory obligations. As I said in my opening remarks, I think that point is relatively easily taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 58 seeks to clarify that an arbitrator's decision to modify a notice to do work shall not for any other purposes modify the statutory or contractual obligations of the parties. It is not for a single arbitrator considering a single notice to rewrite the tenancy agreement or the Agriculture (Maintenance, Repair and Insurance of Fixed Equipment) Regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>566</span>
I hope that when phrasing these orders in the future the Parliamentary Secretary will note that it will considerably shorten our proceedings if the Titles could also be somewhat shortened. We seem to have some cumbersome titles in this mass of agricultural legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear whether it is envisaged that an arbitrator's power of modification under this clause is supposed to exonerate the tenant permanently or temporarily. It is suggested that it could only be temporarily. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will comment upon that. What may be " unnecessary or unjustified " in a notice in, say 1976 may be necessary and justified in, say, 1980—depending on what the item specifies, and, presumably, how the law of the day has approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a point, Mr. Costain, not totally dissimilar from the amendment which we have just been debating. Indeed, I think you originally in your wisdom grouped them together. Clearly, Amendments Nos. 59 and 58 make virtually similar points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

visions of this clause, but which at a subsequent moment could be shown not to be permissible by statutory provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if an arbitrator were to go to a farm, say, in my constituency in the Lake District and were to modify the agreement with regard to materials used in a project, then the case having been apparently settled the tenant would have to go to the National Park Planning Board to get planning permission to carry out any work which was due to be done according to the arbitrator's provisions and demands. It may well be that the Planning Board would say, "No, we will not allow this." This could put the tenant in extremely serious difficulties. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that an amendment of this sort be written into the Bill or that there be existing arrangements within the law which meet these points. I can see extremely serious difficulties arising unless the matter is adequately covered by regulations in one way or another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to assure hon. Members that an arbitrator cannot modify by his award the effect of a direct statutory provision upon the obligations of a tenant. To that extent, the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister speak up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am assuring hon. Members that an arbitrator cannot by his decision amend any statutory provisions upon the obligations of a tenant. To that extent, the amendment is unnecessary. When the arbitrator amends an item, the modification does not amend the tenancy agreement. His decision relates solely to a contested item in a notice to do work which is the subject of the arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) made a valid point in that it may be the case in 1976 that a requirement to take some remedial measure is not justified and is rightly deleted by the arbitrator, but in 1980 the position may be quite different. Therefore, whatever the arbitrator decides in that regard it relates solely to the specific item on the notice to do work. It neither affects the statutory obligation on the tenant nor his long-standing and continuing tenancy agreement with the landlord. I think that hon. Members may be re-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>568</span>
assured and feel free to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I allowed the Parliamentary Secretary to continue. I was going to stand up, but I noticed that he was keen to get in even before my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). I had hoped that he was going to say this, because it is my belief also that an arbitrator has no right to alter by his decision the statutory obligation on the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, will the Parliamentary Secretary ensure that not only is it his Department's belief that the clauses which he has inserted into the Bill do not alter the law in any other way, but that it is made clear to arbitrators that, in fact, they cannot so do? I do not want in the future any arbitrators to proceed along false lines in the belief that they can. Several professional bodies seem to believe that this amendment is necessary in order to put the matter right. Therefore, I am glad to hear what the Minister says. All I would ask is, that he makes it absolutely clear and ensures, before the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament, that this is the case, and that no doubt arises in some case in law which would seem to give the arbitrator power to alter matters other than those which are dealt with under this clause directly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to dwell on this matter, but I am not entirely satisfied. I envisage difficulties arising, and I am sorry to come back to the point relating to national parks. Perhaps I may build up a specific scenario upon which the Parliamentary Secretary might explain how it will be affected by these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of a tenancy agreement which says that the tenant has to maintain the roofs of farm buildings in the same material as that already used on those buildings. For example, a farm on the verge of the Lake District is roofed in the traditional Westmorland greens late, which is a very expensive material. The roof falls into disrepair and the landlord serves a notice to do work on the tenant to replace the roof with Westmorland green slate. Suppose the tenant was then to use the powers of this clause to try to get the materials changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having looked at the building, the arbitrator might say "In my view, it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>569</span>
unreasonable to ask the tenant to use the traditional material and, as the building is on the verge of the Lake District and not in the most beautiful part of the national park, I direct that he should be allowed to use green-coloured asbestos sheets". Nowadays these sheets are used much more widely in the countryside and are nothing like as jarring as the traditional white asbestos sheets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That decision would necessitate obtaining planning permission from the Planning Board. I want to know what happens if the Planning Board refuses the request. From what the Parliamentary Secretary has said I understand that the condition that the arbitrator has imposed to use coloured asbestos sheets would not apply, because the Planning authority had refused the application. What happens next? Does the whole rigmarole of the arbitration have to be gone through again whereby the tenant could then apply to use concrete tiles, some of which are very close, perhaps not to Westmorland green slate, but to the traditional stone slab roofs which are used, for instance, in the Yorkshire Dales National Park?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point raises all sorts of difficulties. One might go from stage to stage using more and more expensive materials, for instance, for a roof as the planning authority was saying progressively "No" to each request and still insisting in the end that the traditional materials should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that this point was raised on a previous amendment, but I think the implications are stronger in this amendment. Could the Parliamentary Secretary explain to me how a case such as I have outlined would be resolved? I assure him that it is exactly the sort of thing which goes on in the national parks where the planning boards are, quite rightly, jealous of maintaining the structures and the beauty and amenities of the area. One could foresee a running battle between what an arbitrator would award and what the planning board would be prepared to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by giving the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) the assurance he sought. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has again raised the important question of the amenities of areas such as national parks. I have already agreed to come back to some of the points that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>570</span>
have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the specific point raised by the hon. Member this morning, I think that he would Be the first to acknowledge that the arbitrator would be expected to use his common sense. I say that not to imply that the hon. Member has not raised a valid point, but to suggest that, in most cases, there would be a sensible and reasonable decision which the arbitrator could arrive at. Obviously, there would be some situations where the arbitrator would, sensibly, have to say that the man could not get away with putting on a type of roof which would be unaceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was discussing to what extent the arbitrator was required to take into account considerations of amenity and wider good husbandry considerations, I undertook to come back with a further interpretation of that and make absolutely sure that the arbitrator would be required to take into account these broader and wider considerations. On the basis of his experience, I think that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West would confirm that very often we have to face up to the fact that the basis of arbitration is to enable someone to exercise common sense. That is the first point we must keep in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the potential difficulties—it is obviously the function of hon. Members opposite to refer to difficulties which might occur if the Bill were to become law—on the specific question of planning permission. In a sense that was one of the narrower points heraised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing new about pieces of legislation conflicting. It is happening all the time. Everyone who knows how local authorities work will know that. I think that my local authority in Edinburgh employs a full-time man—he is called a programme co-ordinator—who makes sure that one department is not doing something under one piece of legislation which conflicts with what another department is doing under another piece of legislation. One piece of legislation could make it illegal to demolish a building and another piece of legislationcould say that the building was required to be demolished on structural grounds. I make the point that there is nothing particularly new about pieces of legislation conflicting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am speaking very much off the cuff
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>571</span>
and would want to come back to this question on Report, but I should like to think that therewould be scope for the arbitrator to make a decision subject to planning permission where he thought that he was going out on a limb. For example, in a national park area, the tradition might be for a thatched roof and there may have been a case 100 years ago for maintaining that. But there could be buildings in the area that did not have thatched roofs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take an extreme case, perhaps the landlord was requiring a building to be completely thatched where half the roof was thatched and the other half not. In that sort of situation, wherethere was likely to be a danger of a planning decision countermanding that request, I should have thought that the arbitrator might make a ruling subject to planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member has raised an important point and I think I would do him more justice if I agreed to come back to the narrow point in regard to planning permission on Report. I have agreedto come back on the wider question of the requirements on farmers to carry out certain improvements and to maintain certain types of buildings and structures on amenity grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of these assurances, I hope that the hon. Member will be able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the Minister is making the arbitrator in this case what he called the programme coordinator. The arbitrator has not only to consider what he thinks is right for the particular arbitration he has in hand for the various items connected with farm buildings and so on, but he must also think of planning controls. I know there are cases whereone would say it was nonsense to pursue a certain line—for example, where a roof was half thatch and half galvanised iron it would be reasonable to say that the whole roof should be thatched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to repeat the long title of the Agriculture (Maintenance, Repair and Insurance of Fixed Equipment) Regulations which are now becoming the Bible for all relations between land lord and tenant. In fact these regulations are written into most modern agreements. The regulations are sensible and are revised every so many years. But there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>572</span>
are many older agreements which do not mention such regulations at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arbitrator's difficulty will be to bear in mind all these things. He has the contract between the landlord and the tenant which writes in the whole of the repair regulations which are usually sensible and he must not go against any of those regulations when he makes what might seem a sensible suggestion for deleting one particular item. I think it is putting an immense burden on the shoulders of an arbitrator to have to deal with these contractual and otherrequirements laid down by law as well as all his other duties
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear the Minister say that he would draw this to everyone's attention and that he would look at the matter again not only on the narrow point of planning but also on the points to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major one which is likely to cause trouble is the maintenance and repair regulations. Theyare part of everybody's Bible and part of the law of the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the valid point raised by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling). Let us take a hypothetical case of the planning authority of a national park not agreeing with the views of the arbitrator that the cost of rebuilding or re-erecting a roof would be £100 more by using the old system—putting on old slates—than if one put on corrugated sheets of whatever colour one chooses. If at the end of the daythe national park planning committee did not concede the views of the arbitrator and the tenant, what would eventually happen? Would the arbitrator have the right to reimburse the tenant for the extra cost involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. The only thing that I need say further which would be helpful is to point out that the enactment of these clauses will require us to re-issuethe regulations. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) picked up this point. We shall have to revise and re-issue the appropriate regulations in the Notice to Remedy and Notice to Quit Orders. It may be that we can write into these regulations what will, in effect, be advice to arbitrators to help them over these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must always have at the back of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>573</span>
our minds that we are basically agreed as to the object of the clause and that we are simply discussing ways of getting over difficulties which will arise from these changes in individualcases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. We are trying to be as constructive as we can on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary's statement that all directives—or whatever is the correctterm—sent to arbitrators are to be re-written confirms our point that Clauses 11 and 12 are a substantial change in the practical law relating to landlord and tenant, and on that we shall have more to say at another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) made the point that arbitrators will have to be co-ordinated—I think that was the word he used taken from the Parliamentary Secretary's phrase—at some time, anyhow. In view of the way the ParliamentarySecretary proposes to handle the matter, and the fact that he has sympathetically taken on board certain points, I have no wish to press the amendments. Therefore, I beg to ask leave towithdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 54, in page 13, line 37, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) If a landlord is aggrieved by any modification made by an arbitrator of a notice to do work in the exercise of powers given under paragraph (	<i>aa</i>) aforesaid, the landlord may within one month after receiving the award of the arbitrator apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal to review the decision of the arbitrator.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) On an application under subsection (2) of this section, the Agricultural Land Tribunal mayconfirm, modify or set aside the decision of the arbitrator wholly or in part and may, if itthinks fit, extend the time within which the tenant is required to comply with the notice to do work".</p></blockquote>
I must straight away make it clear that this is a probing amendment. The Opposition have had completely conflicting advice on the point. Therefore, I felt it only right that we should table the amendment, but it would be wrong for the Parliamentary Secretary to conclude from that that we necessarily agree with it all. However, I hope that in the debate that will follow some points will come out perhaps showing why the Government's approach has been chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Country Landowners' Association
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>574</span>
take the view that it is somewhat questionable as to whether an arbitrator should have power to modify contractual obligations made freely between landlord and tenant. I understand the Association's concern. Let us face it—many arbitrators in many other spheres already havethis power, I accept the Association's concern that those who freely sign a document, and do so in the certain knowledge that they will be expected to comply with the legal obligations thereby contained, can at some subsequent date find a third party to change that contract. As I have said, I have a fairly open mind about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CLA believes that this power be better exercised by a tribunal such as the Agricultural Land Tribunal which is composed of a lawyer chairman, a National Farmers' Union nominated member and a CLA nominated member from the Lord Chancellor's Panel. The chairman usually appointsup to two assessors and so the expertise of land agents can be made available to the ALT. I suspect that the merits or otherwise of the Agricultural Land Tribunal will be better debated under Clause 12, and although it would be proper for me to say something about them on this amendment, I do not intend to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide for an appeal to the ALT to review the arbitrator's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ideally the CLA would prefer the tribunal to be substituted for arbitration. However, that would require a recasting of the whole scheme under the clause. I fully acknowledge that. Theimpression I gain from what was at the back of the CLA 's mind in tabling the amendment is that thereare special circumstances—this was mentioned on Second Reading—where arbitratorsget a reputation for either being " landlords' men " or " tenants' men". This is usually unfair. We acknowledge that, but nevertheless it can happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) will agree that there are special problems in Wales where Welsh-speaking arbitrators are required. It is, I understand,common for this to be requested, particularly by the tenants, and because there are few suitably qualified people they tend to get known as " tenants' men". probably unfairly. However, thisis the point the amendment seeks to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should he glad to hear the Govern-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>575</span>
ment's viewpoint on this matter, because, if we rely on the arbitration procedure—on the whole, as I have said, we have indicated our approval of the clause—to start trying to recast it all in one amendment would be both unfair and unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the even-handed justice the hon. Gentleman is seeking, saying that an arbitrator may he either a " landlords' man " or a " tenants' man ", why is there no mention of the phrase " if a tenant is aggrieved"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical matter. It is the progress of the way in which the notice is served. However, I am coming to the comments of the National Farmers' Union; it takes a contrary view and prefers the arbitrator to carry out the final decision. I should say that I would never wish to be quoted as saying that arbitrators were " tenants' men " or " landlords' men". I made the point that a good many farmers get that impression, as do a good many landlords. The purpose of the amendment is to substitute the Agricultural Land Tribunal for an individual arbitrator, rightly or wrongly. The NFU considers it totally inappropriate that an aggrieved landlord should have a right of appeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal in the way suggested, and similarly it says that an aggrieved tenant should not have such a right of appeal either. In other words, it does not think that this is a suitable substitute. It says that there seemsno reason to suppose that agricultural arbitrators are not competent to reach a fair and proper finding on these matters. Moreover, whereas matters relating to the repair and maintenance of agricultural holdings are suitably within the jurisdiction of the professional menwho act as agricultural arbitrators, there is a question mark over the competence of the Agricultural Land Tribunal to deal with this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that by arguing both sides of the matter in an open way I make it clear once again thatthis is purely a probing amendment and not one which the Opposition would automatically say they wish to press. It is reasonable that the Committee should find out some of the philosophy behind the Government's decision to allow a single arbitrator to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>576</span>
carry out these functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the list of repairs to be done comes in from the landlord, and therefore in a sense it is a landlord's list. But the situation arises where the tenant himself may he aggrieved equally by a decision made by the arbitrator. If we were seeking even-handed justice, I should have thought that the hon. Member would have included the tenant aspect if the tenant was aggrieved. It is not enough to say that the CLA wants it this way andthe NFU does not want it at all, and that therefore we can leave out the tenant. If we are to put forward the view of the CLA that this is the way to do it, and if we were to accept that, we must then modify the NFU 's view in order to protect the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must read further through the Bill. The purpose of Clause 12 is to do just this. It will allow an aggrieved tenant to go on to the Agricultural Land Tribunal and, in due course, we shall be producing some cogent arguments against Clause 12. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is reading the correct motives into our tabling of the amendment. I take his point that, of course, in any arbitration procedure both sides should have an equal opportunity for appeal. We have been saying that, and I hope that he will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the earlier amendment, when the hon. Gentleman said that we should not do anything which might cut across statutory provisions, it might also be useful not to produce an amendment which might cut across aspects we wish to include in Clause 12 in relation to the tenant. There is no case for the amendment in principle. If it were to be accepted in principle, it must be done evenly. This is the only point which I am making. I hope that notice will be taken of that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come down on the side of the NFU in this instance. I I believe that it would bea pity if it were to go to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. One of my general feelings is that the clause will drag out proceedings. Whatever we may say, this will drag the proceedings out and make them much more costly for farming,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>577</span>
whether from the point of view of the landlord or the tenant. I believe that this would be another unnecessary delaying stage. However, it was right to table the amendment and to hear the Minister's opinion on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning a point which was brought up, I believe, on Second Reading, of which the Minister may or may not be aware, a comment was made afterwards by the secretary of the Glamorgan Branchof the Farmers' Union of Wales, I believe, not the National Farmers' Union. He made some aspersions on arbitrators, saying that they:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… were in many cases estate agents and rarely farmers who knew the practical reality of farming problems."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) has pointed out what my father said about me. It is perfectly true, because it needs an immense amount of wisdom and brains to be a farmer. This was particularly true in 1933, when I wanted to become a farmer, because to stay in the farming business at all at that time required a lot of wisdom and brains and, quite frankly, quite a bit of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to return to the point about the arbitrator, the secretary of the Farmers' Union of Wales, after a complaint from the president of the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers,wrote to him, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Please accept my sincere apologies for any hurt which may have unintentionally been caused toyou or your members."</p></blockquote>
He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My Union's employees have the highest regard for the integrity and competence of the members of your Association in Wales."</p></blockquote>
I think that that nails that point for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I return to my feeling that, on balance, although I am waiting to hear what the Minister has to say, I believe that it is better not to have another item along the road which willdelay matters or yet another part of the Bill referring to another tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister will have to consider carefully whether this would lead to an increase in the work of the Agricultural Land Tribunal. Consideration may need to be given to the number of people serving on the Agricultural Land Tribunal so that they can deal with casesquickly. I also wonder whether the composition of the tribunal, with which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>578</span>
I have never been quite happy, should be looked at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I view anything that the CLA proposes and supports with a great deal of scepticism, in view of the misrepresentation which some of my remarks have received from that body. If the CLA wants something in the Bill, I should have to look at it carefully. I should be more prepared to look at what the NFU is supporting. I wish to support my hon. Friend the Memberfor Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) in that the amendment falls down badly in considering only oneside of the arbitration without the other. If the tenant had also been included, there would be a great deal of merit in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has been useful as a probing amendment in clarifying certain points but I shouldlike to clarify a further point. On Second Reading, I commented on arbitrators. I repeat that some tenants lack confidence in the arbitration process, whether rightly or wrongly. There is no getting away from that. In some instances they identify the arbitrators with the landlord's side. In that case, it would be invaluable to have a long stop, that is to say, machineryfor appeal on a decision. As it stands at present, the arbitrator is the long stop; he is theone and only source of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained earlier—I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was present—how an arbitrator is chosen. He is chosen by the tenant's representative and the landlord's representative as somebody to whom they and the tenant agree. If they cannot agree, the Lord Chancellor appoints somebody. Usually the tenant's valuer chooses someone and he asks thetenant if he is happy with him, so I do not understand how the question that he may be on the landlord's side can arise in anybody's mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, because he has helped me with one point. He said that, if the tenant disagreed with the choice, the Lord Chanceller appoints somebody, but he appoints from within a pool of persons with whom the tenant is not always satisfied. He appoints somebody from a group of people who are involved in land transactions,so the tenants are suspicious in some cases. Therefore,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>579</span>
a long stop could perform a useful function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use saying that Clause 12 provides for the tenant, because by Clause 12 the stage ofreceiving notice to quit has been reached. We want something to happen before that notice toquit has been served, so that the tenant can appeal to someone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend may not be satisfied that the Agricultural Land Tribunal should be the body. However, providing that there is a source of appeal for either side on the decision I think thatit would be a satisfactory arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) should realise that the represenatives of both sides have to agree on an arbitrator, not only the tenant's representative, but he is absolutely right to say that there should be some means of appeal. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not pay too much regard to the fact that the arguments so far adduced in favour of the amendment come only from the CLA. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) was unduly frank in disclosing the conflict of opinion that exists between the NFU and the CLA on the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFU has given its opinion. I do not know how these opinions are formed. As a member of that union, I sometimes wonder how these opinions are expressed and to what extent individualmembers, or, indeed, country branches, have any say as to what finally comes out of that august building in Knightsbridge. However, the NFU has its ways of expressing its opinions tothis House. and I should have thought that the right approach would be to disregard both whatthe NFU and the CLA said about this, but to use our own common sense—I am adopting theParliamentary Secretary's phrase which he has used several times—and our own judgment upon these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to consider why a landlord would feel aggrieved in a matter like this.Why would he want to appeal? I am sure that there could be only one reason, namely, that the arbitrator had decided upon a lower standard of method or of material than he, the landlord thought desirable or the tenant himself had thought desirable in entering
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>580</span>
into the original agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins), I am doubtful whether the arbitrator normally appointed is fully qualified to pass a judgment on these matters. We know that in the ordinary way he would be a chartered surveyor and would bedrawn from that branch of the profession concerned almost exclusively with agricultural work auctioneers, valuers and the like. I am a little doubtful whether such an arbitrator is quite qualified—and many of them would confess this themselves—to decide whether a certain material or a certain method of work was right to be used in the schedule concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work they are really being called upon to do is the work that would otherwise be done by an architect. We are familiar with what architects do in the way of arbitration. They do this kind of arbitration in the ordinary way, but the architect-arbitrator would be excluded almostas a measure of fairness from deciding this kind of matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arbitrator would he free to seek advice, depending upon the size of the job,as to whether it is a major set of buildings for a 1,000-acre farm or a 50-acre holding, from, say, a small builder, an architect, a building surveyor or anybody who was qualified, if hefelt he was not able to decide on the type of material. What he would be able to decide on iswhether a particular building was redundant or otherwise necessary to the holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as well as being many other things, is also a man of the world and he knows how speedily these arbitrations have to be conducted, how both parties are concernedabout the expense and with how soon they can readily reach a decision. I repeat that, if the decision is one where the landlord feels aggrieved, it would he simply because he feels that the landscape of his property will be the worse as a result of the judgment passed by the arbitrator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter where we should all share some concern. I appreciate that hon. Gentlemen opposite may belong to what is sometimes called the Tribune Group, but they have a certain concern, as might any landlord, for the quality of the landscape and they have an interest. I hopethat they will not be wholly pre-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>581</span>
judiced against this amendment because it happens to have come from the CLA. I repeat that theonly occasion when the landlord will be aggrieved will be when the landscape, as a result of the arbitrator's decision, would be a little worse than it would otherwise be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords, when they are insistent upon or finicky about the quality of their landscapes very often charge a lower rent. This is usually taken into account when the rent is agreed and whenthe terms of the lease are settled which require the conditions we are talking about and wherewe are inviting arbitrators to say " Those conditions can go out of the window."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Landlords will feel a natural sense of grievance if, having allowed a tenant to pay a reduced rent to enable him to afford the materials and the methods as set out in their contract, an arbitrator, who may know little about the thing and who may be that kind of chartered surveyor who is ill-acquainted with the subject, or not as well acquainted as he might be, decides a matter of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the case for appeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal is considerable. I appreciatethe point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West. Of course there would be some extra cost, but against that we would all agree that the Agricultural Land Tribunal has the respect of the whole agricultural profession. I do not think any of us, as constituencyMembers, can think of any case of agreements stemming from a decision made by the Agricultural Land Tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the important part of my argument is that the Agricultural Land Tribunal can do somethingwhich the ordinary arbitrator cannot. The chairman of the tribunal can bring on to the tribunal two assesors, and one, or perhaps both, may be architects, or certainly may be skilled and qualified to pass an opinion about the work that needs to be done on the farm by the tenant. This is the kind of advice which should be available to the tribunal and which would not be available to an arbitrator, when that arbitrator was deciding a matter like this with some degree of haste and under all the pressures we know arbitrators have when, in their busyprofessional life, they take a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>582</span>
few hours off from their other work to conduct an arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only a matter of justice for one party to a contract, but the public as a whole havean interest in this if we are concerned about the quality of the landscape and we wish to seahigh standard of material being used in our farm buildings of a kind which both landlord andtenant had previously agreed upon. If we are concerned about those things, there should be a chance of an appeal, and an appeal where an architect or somebody particularly qualified in these matters, could assist in the judgment to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may have been a probing amendment, but it has still produced a useful debate in which a number of important issues have come up. The last two contributions, from the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) and from my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), have been particularly helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can clarify one or two points that still remain in my mind. Although I do not underestimate the skill and professional expertise of arbitrators, I am not sure whether the power to modify or change contractual obligations is a proper function of an arbitrator. I hope that the Under-Secretary will direct his mind and his comments, in summing up onthis amendment, to that point. I believe it is important that both the landlord and the interests of conservation on the land and of the environment as well as the interests of a tenant farmer should be taken into consideration and that there should be this safeguard of a appeal or, as the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor said, a long stop—a body, a person perhaps, whom both the tenant and the landlord can trust and have full respect for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is the feeling that an arbitrator in some areas is more biased towards the landowner, and perhaps landowners in another area will say that the arbitrator—or arbitrators—in that area is more biased towards the tenants. My view is that arbitrators are a fine body of people, who do an extremely good job. In my experience over a numberof years, I have had no reason at all to doubt their competence in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, in dealing with legislation,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>583</span>
we have to cater for all circumstances. Therefore, while my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) has indicated that we are not likely to press the amendment to a Division, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will apply his mind particularly to the question whether the power to modify a contractual obligation is the proper function of an arbitrator, or whether the matter should go in the ultimate to the Agricultural Land Tribunal which is composed, as we know, of highly qualified and competent people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Joan Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept to some extent what the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) said about landowners' interests in landscape and environment. As someone who has livedin a rural area all her life, I accept what the hon. Gentleman said. But we on the Governmentside are also men and women of the world. We understand, too, that landowners have another interest in the ownership of land, namely, the power of wealth and influence which it gives them, particularly in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Worry and tax bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right; as the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said, it also brings worry and tax bills. If landowners are still worried about tax bills, all I can say isthat they fight jolly hard to retain their ownership of the land which gives them money, wealth and influence in rural areas. I speak from long experience of living in a rural area Ican therefore understand why tenants, rightly or wrongly, fear that arbitrators are likely to be more influenced by, and give preference to, landowners rather than tenants. I understand that feeling on the part of tenants, having seen the effect that land ownership has, and the power and influence which, as I said, it gives in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of her remarks, would the hon. Lady the Member for Sheffield, Brightside, be kind enough to confirm that this is the reason why she was quoted in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> two days ago as having sponsored a proposal by the Labour Party's home policy committee for the nationalisation of all agricultural land at a cost of £15,000 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I comment on one thing that the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton)said? He talked about the doubts he had about the arbitrator having the right to vary contractual obligations. The hon. Gentleman is broadening the amendment into another sphere. I accept the arbitrator's right to vary a contract as set down in the Bill. What I want, as I said earlier, is a longstop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I fear—and this is true of all public inquiries—is that one man will affecthe situation and come to a subjective decision. He may try to be objective, but that is not always possible. That is why I should like more than one person to be involved in the decision. I am prepared to trust arbitrators to do a good job, but there must be the means of checking on a case in which the arbitrator might have been biased. That is why I want a longstop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my opinion, this is a good probing amendment. But I have two questionsto ask the Minister. What would the Minister's view have been if the wording of the amendment had included—
	<br><blockquote><p>"if a landlord or a tenant"—</p></blockquote>
I agree with the remarks of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick)—to cover the case where a tenant is aggrieved by any modification?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed cases being referred to arbitration. I wonder what percentage of farmers in Britain, in Wales in particular, refer disputes to arbitration. If the Minister is not able toreply today, I hope that he will write to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that when we come to Clause 12, which gives the tenant certain rights, the hon. Gentleman will in equity be pressing that the landlord should have the same rights?If not, I suspect that the argument falls down. It is because of Clause 12 that the amendment is phrased in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr, Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no reason why an arbitrator, who is appointed to deal with a notice to do work, should amend or delete items from the notice if the landlord can demonstrate that they are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>585</span>
soundly based. Both landlord and tenant will have full opportunity to explain to the arbitrator why they think that a particular item on the list is reasonable, in the case of landlord, orunreasonable in the case of a tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I tell the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) that we appoint about 400 to 500 arbitrators in a year. We virtually never receive complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) raised the question—I cannot go very deeply into it—which has been raised by other hon. Members, too, about some arbitrators being regarded as landlords' men and others as tenants' men. In my hon. Friend's view, the danger is that arbitrators will tend to be more biased towards the landlord. I suggest that we must face up to the question that, if that is generally the case, it means that there is something wrong with the method of appointment of arbitrators. I am sure that my hon. Friend will accept that the matter must be dealt with at that level. If we want to pursue that issue—and the Ministry and I have no evidence of that state of affairs—it must be pursued in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that there is no appeal from an arbitrator on a question of fact, either under theArbitration Act 1950 or under the special code for agriculture. The award in an agricultural arbitration may be challenged in the county court only on a complaint of misconduct, or in theHigh Court if the award contains a manifest error of law. So the amendment would introduce an entirely new concept. Moreover, the kind of decisions required by arbitrators under the new powers are no more difficult than many of the decisions which arbitrators have to take under theexisting provisions of the agricultural holdings legislation, from which no appeal lies on fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may possibly be argued that, in effect, Clause 12 allows the tenant to appeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal against an arbitrator's decision on a notice to quit. This is not so, andthere is an important distinction here. The question to be determined by the Agricultural LandTribunal will be different from that determined by the arbitrator. The tribunal will be concerned only with applying the fair and reasonable landlord test, whereas the arbitrator is concerned with facts and with professional dis-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>586</span>
cretion regarding those facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows from that, I suggest, that my hon. Friends the Members for Renfrew-shire, West (Mr.Buchan) and for Brecon and Radnor, as well as the hon. Member for Cardigan, are on strong ground when they argue that, to be even-handed, an amendment of this nature would have to include the tenant, because the appeal which the tenant could make to the ALT would be different and would be taken on the basis of different grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that the purpose of the clause is to prevent harassment of tenants. It is to prevent landlords from requiring tenants to do items of work or improvements which are unreasonable, whereby through default such landlords can secure an eviction. That issue is notat stake. The question of appeal does not affect that matter, because the Bill will make it impossible for the landlord to evict a tenant on that basis in future. I ask hon. Members to bearthat factor in mind and the fact that the amendment refers solely to the question of whether an item should have been deleted from the list, which will not in the end have any bearing on whether the tenant will be evicted, because the tenant will have the right of appeal in the last analysis to the Agricultural Land Tribunal which would apply the " reasonable landlord " test. On those grounds, I hope that hon. Members will accept that it would not be appropriate to depart from a longstanding precedent with regard to arbitrators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would enlarge on his understanding ofthe term " tenants". We had an interesting exchange in the Chamber the other day between the shadow Solicitor-General and Government Members on the Trade Union Bill. The shadow Solictor-General rested his case on the differentiation between facts and the remainder of the matter. Hecame under some pretty tough cross-questioning from hon. Members on the Government side and had to cough and splutter and admit that there is an area of great subjectivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. It would be helpful if hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a fair point. A lot of people use the word " facts". They call things facts which are not facts. For example, estimates of future expenditure are described as facts. I heard this the other day in Committee. They are nothing of the kind, of course. They are simply estimates. Therefore, when I speak of facts I mean facts—for example, the fact of whether the tenancy agreement says A or B.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the contractual obligation is a fact?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman also say in arbitration that an estimate is not a fact?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think hon. Members are being a little obtuse. What I am saying is that if, in fact, the Government Mr. Nicholas Winterton: If in fact!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If wages rose by 30 per cent. last year and the Government state that wages rose by 30 per cent, last year, that is a fact. But if the Government say, " Our estimate is that wages will rise by 30 per cent. next year ", I do not regard that as a fact, it is an estimate. This is a very delicate area. But I do not want to go into an argument about semantics. Therefore, I think. Mr. Costain, that it would be helpful if I came back to the amendment, interesting though these diversions are, especially when we are dealing with highly technical matters such as these.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that for the reasons I have given hon. Members will appreciate that it would be unwise for us to accept this amendment. It is not even-handed. It would also be unwise to want to introduce the principle of appeal on this question. It will not bring the tenancy or the landlordany great advantage at the end of the day because what they are seeking is to prevent harassment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the point about the even-handedness of the amendment. It is for this reason that I shall not press it. However, I think there is to some extent a deliberate bias towards the tenant in Clause 12 when it comes to appeal. It would be wrong to start arguing that point. But that is why the amendment was tabled in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will, of course, be in everybody's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>588</span>
interest, but particularly that of the tenant, if we do not allow these procedures to become too lengthy. When we come to debate this matter later we shall find that the more appeal courts, which, so to speak, are produced, the greater the injustice because appeals can take place and expenses be incurred that are not recoverable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to my hon. Friend the Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) that, if I need notapologise if I have been definitive about those who have advised me on this matter. I think it is only right when we are dealing with such highly technical points. Professional bodies, whether they be of one particular sectional interest or another, have a professional interest above that which any hon. Member can attain in this place, and therefore it is not unreasonableto occasionally put a tag on an amendment. However, I hope that I have been as fair as possible in putting both sides of this particular case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was congratulating my hon. Friend on his frankness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think what my hon. Friend actually said was that I have been too frank. But I donot apologise for that because I believe it is right that the sources of some of these amendments should be made clear. I have always made it my practice to do so and I intend to continue so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must take up the contention of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick)that everything the CIA puts out is wrong and everything that the NFU puts out is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing could be more nonsensical. Certainly, if we are trying to achieve a fair debate in this Committee, to go on such assumptions shows a particularly closed mind. I would not wish the hon. Member to be accused of such a dreadful thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to the Committee if we could see this exemplified, and occasionally we saw the Opposition taking the side of the farmers and the tenants instead of the CIA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, may I say that on the question of the pool of arbitrators I notice that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) suggested in his speech on Second Reading that the Government might consider appointing a full-time Government official to carry out arbitrations. I think I can say on behalf of all sides of the industry that such a proposal would be greeted with a great deal of dismay by all the tenants I know and, I suspect, by all those involved, if such a person were to be appointed. It is the very important contribution that those who are daily practising the matters make to arbitrations that originally set up the scheme. It would have been quite easy for these matters to have been decided in courts of law by magistrates, by stipendary magistrates, or in the Crown Court. However, because it was felt at the time of the original legislation that those people could not have a fair view, as they did not operatethe matter day in and day out, the arbitration procedures were set up. I sincerely hope that before he presses the point too hard the hon. Gentleman will give careful thought to the philosophy behind the arbitration procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would appreciate it if the hon. Gentleman would modify his comment that all ofus are concerned. It is rather a genralisation to say that everyone likes the procedure, when he cannot possibly have met everyone in the case. I have met people who feel disquiet about the procedure and could support a different form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>590</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if one word slipped out and the hon. Gentleman takes exception to it. He knows full well what I am getting at. The matter does work fairly, because if the professional advisers advising tenants, who are frequently auctioneers in the first instance, believe that an arbitrator is tending to give judgments one way or the other, they do not agree to his appointment. I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary did not have the opportunity earlier, but perhaps on " clause stand part " he will comment on how often it is necessary for arbitration to be reconducted from the pool that is available. I understand that in most cases both sidesusually agree to an arbitrator in advance and there is no need to go any further, because thevery natural balance of the system ensures that it is not in the interests of arbitrators as a whole to give judgments over a period of time one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have started to touch on some parts of the debate that will take place on " clause stand part". I do not want to prolong this part of the debate, because I am anxious that we should go on to discuss the principles of the whole question of harassment and the thoughts behind the Government's proposals. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 79, in page 13, line 37, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Nothing contained in this Act shall have the effect of altering the rights and liabilities of the landlord and tenant during and at the termination of any tenancy under the terms of the tenancy agreement or under sections 57, 58 and 59 of the said Act of 1948 (or, in the caseof Scotland, sections 57, 58 and 59 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949)".</p></blockquote>
The amendment does not come from either the CLA or the NFU, but from the Royal Institution ofChartered Surveyors. It has been able to give some comments from a totally independent viewpoint on the Bill, because its members have to carry out the administration of the legislation.I suppose we shall now receive a diatribe from the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) as to why they are not suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to cover the point that the proposed legislation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>591</span>
would state clearly that the clauses gave relief only from the terms of the tenancy agreement for the limited purposes of contested notices to remedy and subsequent notice to quit proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with any suggestion that in any claims arising both during and at the end of a tenancy neither the landlord's nor the tenant's rights to compensation are to be affected, whether or not the termination arises from proceeding under the proposed clauses. So far as proceedings during the course of a tenancy are concerned, the suggested amendment would pressure the position which follows the rule settled in Kent 	<i>v.</i> Conniff. The amendment clarifies the position for those concerned with agricultural holdings legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is reasonable to say that there is some difference of opinion as to whether the interpretation that the Institution has put on the clause is quite the correct one. I suspect that the Minister will suggest that it is not. I should have thought that the purpose behind the amend-ment was likely to be agreed by all those concerned, and I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make clear that any modification of the notice to do work by an arbitrator under this clause in respect of an item specified in the tenant's counter-notice applies only to the contested notice itself and to the subsequent notice to quit proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters as the direct statutory rights of the landlord to compensation for dilapidations or the tenant's right to compensation for improvements on the termination of a tenancy are notaffected. Indeed, the direct provisions of a statute could not be overruled by an arbitrator'sdecision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obligations of the tenancy agreement are not, therefore, modified in a general sense. I have covered this point. I emphasise the point that something which was not necessary in the view of the arbitrator in 1976 may subsequently be necessary in 1980. However, the important point is that the amendment does not appear to make any change in the operation of the clause.It is, therefore, unnecessary, and I hope that the hon. Member will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

before the legal case in question there was doubt about this matter, and it was only when it came before the Appeal Court that the matter became clear? Is this not an opportunity to make it abundantly clear in this legislation? The Minister says that there is no need for the amendment.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned that our concern about the clause is limited to matters of detail. We accept the basic principle behind the philosophy of the clause and we wish to see the administration of this law improved where it has led to discontent. What I deplore are statements by hon. Members that are deliberately designed to exacerbate a mythical situation that exists between landlord and tenant. This is not the general viewpoint. The vast majority of tenants get on perfectly well with their landlords and one has only the odd case of a dispute where everybody rushes around and tries to take sides without really truly examining what has taken place. This law, which is some 28 years old and is a successor legislation to other previous laws, should be explained in some detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the length of my remarks, but it is a highly complex subject and the question has exercised the minds of many lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, a landlord who is dissatisfied with the farming of his holding by his tenant has anumber of sanctions available to him. The most popular sanction—and the one with which the clause is concerned—is to give the tenant a notice to remedy. This notice must be in the prescribed form which alerts the tenant to his remedies in response and it must contain the following vital information: first, the breaches of which the landlord is complaining; secondly, the work that the landlord requires the tenant to do to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>593</span>
remedy those breaches; and, thirdly, a reasonable period—which, in the case of a noticeto do work must not be less than six months—in which to do the work. Those are the three vital requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A tenant who wishes to challenge that notice to remedy, because he thinks the time is unreasonable because the notice is not in the right form, because it contains work that he is not obliged to do, or because it contains too much work, or for any of a number of similar considera-tions, may challenge that notice to remedy at that stage. Indeed, if he wishes to dispute at any stage his liability to do the work, he must challenge the notice to remedy by giving anotice demanding arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what so many tenants have failed to do. They have failed to use the counter-notice togain the protection of the existing law. Later in my speech I shall question the necessity forthe Government to introduce new legislation because the existing legislation is not already being used as the aggrieved tenants are entitled to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notice having been given demanding, arbitration, the arbitrator has to consider the challenge. It has long been established that he can chuck out the notice either in whole or in part This has been settled law since as long ago as one of the first Court of Appeal cases under the 1948 Act, Budge 	<i>v.</i> Hicks. Price 	<i>v.</i> Romilly in 1960 and Shepherd 	<i>v.</i> Lomas in 1963 extended that principle even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this year the Court of Appeal took the principle further still in a case called Wykes	<i>v.</i> Davis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, these matters are well-established, both in the law of the land by statute and in the practice of the courts in interpreting that law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, an arbitrator may not rewrite the notice to remedy, but if the notice to remedy contains any provision which requires re-writing the arbitrator must strike it out. Similarly,an arbitrator has no discretion to delete an item from a notice to remedy on the basis that, although the tenant is liable to do the work under the terms of his agreement, it is a totallyunreasonable demand which is being made upon him. For example, it may be because he is beingasked to repair an obsolete piece of fixed equip-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>594</span>
ment, such as a dovecote, which is listed as being of outstanding architectural merit but which has no agricultural consequence in a modern context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the arbitrator already possesses—in layman's terms—considerable discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a television programme which has been mentioned before called " Who Owns Britain's Acres? " Perhaps it would be improper for me to go into detail about that, as I believe that legal proceedings concerning that programme are pending. It may be necessary to ask your ruling, Mr. Costain, as to whether an individual case which has been the subject of a television programme and which then becomes subject to legislation is proper for us to discuss in this Committee. I personally am of the view that the matter would only be 	<i>sub judice</i> if I were to refer to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would remind the hon. Member that the 	<i>sub judice</i> rule does not apply to Bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your ruling is so clear and easy, Mr. Costain, that it will relieve me of a certain burden. I have been provided with some of the details of this case, but it is a nice point that perhaps at a future date it may need to be resolved on the Floor of the House. Graveconcern was shown in that programme, if not by constituents of the hon. Member for Brecon andRadnor (Mr. Roderick) by some of his neighbours—he made the point in his Second Reading speech—that the notice to remedy procedures were being abused by certain landlords, particularly in south east Wales, as a means of setting a trap to catch an unwary tenant and to disposses him after wholly unreasonable demands had been made. I hope the hon. Gentleman will thinkthat is a fair statement of that side of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Curiously, in that programme the fact that the tenant who was dispossessed gave some very unsatisfactory replies to certain questions put to him seems to have been ignored. When asked why he had not challenged the landlord's wholly unreasonable notice by arbitration, he replied that he believed that arbitrations were held in secret and he did not hold with a secret court. That belies the whole system; the system allows for a counter-notice and for procedures that have been well used for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>595</span>
In the case concerned the tenant did not use his legally available rights. It is rather like saying that one does not get justice if one does not turn up in court. The fact of the matteris that the British citizen is well protected right across the board; he is well protected bythe legislation that emanates from this House. If he does not choose to take advantage of thatprotection, surely it is very strange for the Government to say they have to bring in a newlaw to give him automatic protection. The new law would still not have operated if he had notserved those counter-notices in the particular cases that were mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the crucial point: by changing the law that individual would still not have been better protected in any way. Surely it is fair to ask why in this Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill we must have these clauses when really no case has been made out for their necessity. We will smile upon them because we believe that it may yet be an improvement, but there is a case to be made out for change quite substantially the whole legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the cases represented in that programme, the landlord gave a series of notices to remedy tovarious tenants requiring them to do grossly unreasonable work, which undoubtedly they were not liable to do, such as building dry stone walls where previously no such walls had existed,and similar matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 11 of the Bill provides for an amendment to be made to Section 19 of the 1963 Act, which itself set up all the procedures, as they now are, for challenging notices to remedy which require the doing of certain specified work, as opposed to non-work notices to remedy —for example a notice requiring a tenant to resume residence in the farmhouse or something of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the amendment is to be made is by adding a further paragraph to Section 19(2 (	<i>a</i>) of the 1963 Act, which will now enable an arbitrator, when a case is referred to him, following the receipt by the tenant of a notice to remedy, to delete from the notice to remedy anyindividual item, or part of an item, if the arbitrator is satisfied that it is unnecessary or unjustified. In practice arbitrators at present do that in many instances. They can delete items if they are satisfied that the tenant is not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>596</span>
liable under the terms of his tenancy agreement to do that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where, however, this new clause will help tenants considerably is that it will enable an arbitrator in effect to relieve the tenant of liability to do work which is unnecessary or unjustified, even though, strictly speaking, he may be liable to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The type of case I have in mind is that of a Cotswold farm tenant who is liable under the regulations regarding maintenance and repair, and probably under ibis tenancy agreement as well,to maintain and repair all field walls. I expect that the Committee will know that it costs anastonishing sum to rebuild a Cotswold dry stone wall. I am not sure whether we have the bene-fit of the knowledge of any hon. Member from that part of the world, but £15 a running yard was the figure a couple of years ago. Of course, to require a tenant to build milesof dilapidated stone wall when it may not be required could be crippling. Surely we all accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend say whether, in a case where a tenant was voluntarily surrendering his tenancy, where the farm was being divided up, and where the farm and farm buildings were going to be taken out of agriculture and turned into a domestic residence, the landowner's requirement for certain dilapidations to be put right would be valid orinvalid? Would the arbitrator be able to strike that requirement out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it—I must tell my hon. Friend that it is no good him putting these questions to me in my unlearned capacity as a non-lawyer under the new clause, yes; considerable discretion will be given to the arbitrator. However, I hope that the Committee willnot accept that in any way as a ruling, because the Parliamentary Secretary may entirely reverse that decision in a moment. Perhaps my hon. Friend would be better if he directed such questions to the Parliamentary Secretary in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just given the Parliamentary Secretary time to get the answer from his civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Similar problems arise where one has old-fashioned, labour-intensive buildings. This is a well-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>597</span>
established case that exists on many tenanted farms today. There are sometimes even listed buildings, such as tithe barns and the like, which are of very limited agricultural value, because they are labour-intensive, compartmentalised and with small apertures, and they are inadequate for modern machinery. In the unusual cases where a tenant is under 	<i>a</i> full repairing obligation, many thousands of pounds worth of work can be imposed upon him through the notice to remedy procedures, which the proposed new provision will resolve, and that we acknowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the proposed new subsection (	<i>ii</i>) is concerned, this will entitle an arbitrator to re-draw, in whole or in part, the column in the notice to remedy in which the work that the tenant is required to do is specified. At present—this surely is the keypurpose of the new clause—an arbitrator can only delete an item or leave it as it stands, but he cannot vary it. In practice, as doubts have to be resolved in favour of the tenant, this works to the benefit of tenants, but this new subsection will change the law in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, therefore, it seem reasonable to assume that both landlords and tenants will welcome the extra flexibility that is to be allowed to arbitrators under the existing procedures inthe new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are those who believe that the arbitrator has at present adequate discretionin these matters and that the practice of carrying out these arbitrations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>598</span>
is not as stated by some hon. Gentlemen and, indeed, by the NFU, which makes no secret of itsdesire that these clauses should be included in the Bill. I think that it is right to say —I do not have the column number in front of me—that the Parliamentary Secretary quoted in his Second Reading speech the fact that the NFU had made a direct request for some changes in the harassment procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am bound to tell the Committee that in my investigations I find that the evidence for this necessity is very slim indeed. In answer to a Parliamentary Question the Government admitted that only 11 cases had come to their attention. They will say that one is too many, but what they do not say is whether, in any of those 11 cases, the tenant, properly advised, went through the procedures of protection available to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a difficulty in this Committee because we cannot debate individual cases dealing with private contracts between individuals. This is where we are in difficulty, Mr. Costain, and I shall understand if the Government wish to claim anonymity. However, unhappily, I must say that the evidence available to me—and I have made polite requests from the bodies concerned—is very little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
