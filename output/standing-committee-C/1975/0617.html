	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—[10th June]—No</i>. 64, in page 7, line 35, to leave out from the word "and" to the end of line 46 and insert the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>)it appears to the court that the person by whom the sum is payable (`the debtor') is unable forthwith to pay the sum and also has other debts; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the court is of opinion that the case may be one in which the debtor's liabilities should be dealt with together under an order providing for the administration of his estate,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the court may, with a view to making an administration order, order him to furnish to the court a list of all his creditors and the amounts which he owes to them respectively.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1A) An order under subsection (1) above may be made by the court of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings there mentioned; and, subject to rules of court, the court shall not make such an order of its own motion without giving the parties to those proceedings an opportunity of being heard "—Oft.

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are discussing the following amendments to the proposed amendment:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>Amendment (	<i>a</i>), in line 6, leave out from "an" to end of line 7 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"administration order as herein defined".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment (	<i>b</i>), in line 6, leave out "an administration" and insert "such an".</p>
	<p>Amendment (	<i>c</i>), in line 8, leave out from "(1A)" to end of line 11 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"Save at the request of the debtor, no order to furnish a list of his creditors shall be made under this section unless notice in the prescribed manner of an application to enforce a judgment (whether by the furnishing of a list of creditors or otherwise) has been made under this section unless notice in the prescribed manner of an application to enforce a judgment (whether by the furnishing of a list of creditors or otherwise) has been served upon the debtor not less than 10 days before the making of an order to furnish a list as aforesaid".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>We are also discussing Amendment No. 66, in page 7, line 46, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"but no such order shall be made unless the debtor has first been afforded full opportunity to oppose the making of such an order if he so wishes and to obtain legal representation on that issue if he so wishes".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, let me round off what I was saying on the points of details relating
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
to the various amendments and the amendments to the amendments. I refer, first, to our Amendments (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), on which I was speaking when we concluded on Tuesday. Let me sum up this way, however. The object of the amendments is to ensure that the wording is as accurate and descriptive as possible or, to say the least, not misleading. This is not merely a technicality—and I know that the Solicitor-General agrees with me on this—because the wording is important and it is important that people are not misled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this instance, we see how a good many people could be misled by the wording " administration of the estate " into thinking that it meant something similar to what he described in c.404, which is a logical deduction to make. We have now discovered that it does not mean that, however. Therefore, since it is regarded as more than a technicality—and I do not suggest that the wording of Amendment (	<i>a</i>) is the ideal solution—I beg to move those two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the third amendment presently. The next two points of detail that arise are not on one of our amendments to the amendment, but on Amendment No. 64.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assist the hon. and learned Gentleman? It is appropriate for him to move Amendment (a) but, technically, we are discussing only Amendments (b) and (c) at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see. In that event, I beg to move Amendment (a) and to give notice that my present intention is to move Amendment (b) should (a) be carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next two points of detail arise not on one of our amendments to the amendment, but on Amendment No. 64 itself. They relate to two phrases. The first is the phrase "unable forthwith to pay". I gladly recognise that Mr. Solicitor has been good enough to say that he will have another look at those words and as regards anything that can be done to secure a better wording, he may look to us for help and co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second one, the phrase "subject to rules". Here, again, I mention it only to acknowledge that Mr. Solicitor has said that he will have another look at those words, because I do not think that he would want them to have the effect that I postulated. Therefore, what I said about the words "unable forthwith to pay", I echo in relation to these words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Amendment (c). It is not, nor is it intended to be, a wrecking amendment in the sense that we normally use that phrase in our proceedings. On the contrary, having re-read what Mr. Solicitor said during our last sitting, I am inclined to think that were we to incorporate Amendment (c), it would be very much in the spirit of what the Mr. Solicitor said since it would have this effect. It would mean that, if a judgment creditor took steps to enforce his judgment debt, the power to make an administration order would arise—and in the context of being for the protection of the debtor when the judgment creditor was taking steps to enforce his judgment. It is greatly in the spirit of what the Solicitor-General was saying. I am not sure that it precludes the court from acting on its own motion. I think that it commits the court to act of its own motion but in that one circumstance, and that is very much on a parallel with Scetion 4 of the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971 where a judgment creditor has applied for an attachment of earnings order to enforce a judgment. Under Section 4, in those circumstances, a court may of its own motion initiate the process of making an administration order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
Therefore, Amendment (	<i>c</i>) is very much in line with that. It would permit, I think, the court of its own motion to initiate the process by ordering a list of creditors, but only in those circumstances where a judgment creditor was moving to enforce his judgment which, as I say, is not only in line with Section 4 of the 1971 Act but very much in line with the purpose of the making of administration orders, both as it has always been and as it was reaffirmed to be by the Solicitor-General at our last sitting. I ask the Minister to consider Amendment (	<i>c</i>). It would be a good deal tidier and might avoid a good many problems that could arise under his amendment as it stands. We propose to move our amendment at the appropriate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 66 is included in the group of amendments we are now discussing, and it adds nothing. It merely suggests a different way of trying to do something we have already discussed, and we do not intend to move it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have clearly explained our position on the group of amendments. I recognise that Amendment No. 64 itself seeks to provide for certain points raised by myself and others. It makes equally clear that if the choice were between Clause 8 as it stands and Clause 8 as amended, the latter would be preferable, but we do not have that stark choice, as the Solicitor-General and the Minister have indicated that the Government are not suggesting that Clause 64 is the be-all and end-all of the matter. Therefore, we shall accept Amendment No. 64, but only on the basis that has been common to both sides, that it is a step forward but that it is by no means the end of the discussion either on the precise form of subsection (1) or on Clause 8 as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say for the record as it may be relevant to those who have to consider what should be dealt with at the next stage, that of course it is only right for us to reserve our position on Clause 8 as a whole until we know what will be the final form of subsection (1), if Clause 8 is to remain in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has cleared up one important aspect of the problems with which we have been dealing in connection with this clause. From the start, it has been said that one of the purposes of Clause 8 is to strengthen the powers of enforcement of judgment debts against the self-employed. I will not make lengthy quotations, but I give the references to some of the passages on which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
I rely: the Lord Chancellor on Second Reading in another place at c.764, and the Under-Secretary of State for Trade on Second Reading at c.1470. Perhaps the matter was most succinctly put in a letter dated 20th February to the Working Party from The Department of Trade which says that Clause 8:
	<br><blockquote><p>"is of particular value in the case of self-employed debtors, against whom attachment of earnings Orders cannot be made and it complements existing provisions under the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971 whereby an Administration Order can be made where there is default under an attachment of earnings order. The Clause also helps to fill the gap which will be left by raising the limit for founding a bankruptcy petition from £50 to £300."</p></blockquote>
This was a proposition that has been apparent in many of our debates all through the course of the Bill. In so many of our debates, Mr. English, you have allowed us to go outside a particular clause because we have all recognised that the Bill represents a package and that we must not take one matter in isolation from another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of this and the main grounds of opposition to Clause 8(1) and the amendment to it, which is the heart of the clause, has been that it was useless for the purpose to which I have just referred. It was useless as something designed to give a judgment creditor a better right to enforce his debt. That is what a lot of the argument has been about. For that reason, the Working Party says that it would still be useless even if the amendment were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, I think Mr. Solicitor has cleared the air on that. In his second speech last week he made it perfectly clear that he recognises that this adds nothing to the power of a judgment creditor to enforce the debt, and that the purpose is what it has always been—namely, that of an administration order. Therefore, if we get that out of the way, we can really direct our minds between now and Report to the effectiveness of the clause in the context in which it now ought to be seen, namely, as fulfilling or not fulfilling a purpose so clearly specified by Mr. Solicitor in his speech last week. In that context, it seems to me that we have these points to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the time that it was being said that this was something which would assist the judgment creditor, I for one—and there have been others—have been saying "That is not quite right. If it is right, it should be made available on the application of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
judgment creditor." That is one of the points to which effect has been given in Amendment No. 64. I leave out the question of whether it could have been done, anyway, because I do not want to get into an argument about that. Even if it might have been done before, it has been made perfectly clear now by this amendment that that is to be the right of a judgment creditor. If we are not thinking now in terms of the importance of the judgment creditor's rights, we are thrown back to whether it should, in practice, give him the right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pose it as a question. All of this has developed at a fairly late stage. I am not being critical about that, it has, and we are all doing our best to make a useful and sensible provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the judgment creditor, if we view the whole Bill in the context in which I am now discussing it, it is important to ensure that he has the right to oppose making an order because his interests may not be improved by the making of such an order. Indeed, his interests may be seriously disadvantaged in so doing. It is important that he should have the right to be heard before an order is made. Amendment No. 64 provides for that, as will my Amendment No. 68 when we come to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the considerations to be kept in mind when considering whether the judgment creditor should be allowed to apply. As to the right of the judgment debtor to apply, that has never been in issue. It has always been available at the request of the judgment debtor, so there is no need for a complicated provision to ensure that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main question which remains on this basis is whether the court should be empowered to make this order of its own motion. I quite appreciate that we are now talking about the first stage—the ordering of a list of creditors—but, of course, once the process is set in motion, it tends to go through. As I understand it, the intention here is that the court should have the power, not merely to order a list of creditors of its own motion but to make an administration order of its own motion, and not merely of its own motion but even though all parties who are before it may be asking it not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a very extreme power. Though I have given the best consideration I can to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
the arguments put forward, at the moment I find it most difficult to see how that can be justified or any justification having been put forward for it so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can just see that, if a judgment creditor is moving to enforce a judgment and the court takes the view that an administration order might be in everybody's interest, there may be a case for making an order for a list of creditors, even though the working party makes a strong point when it says that, so long as subsection (4) remains in the clause, the court should not even make an order for the list of creditors without giving notice to the debtor. It is quite wrong that something should be done which may be deemed to be an act of bankruptcy by the debtor without notice to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put that in rather general terms because the Solicitor-General has indicated to me that subsection (4) is undergoing consideration, and it may be possible to meet the objections raised on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on the question of whether the court should be able to act of its own motion, I can see the argument that, where a judgment creditor is moving to enforce a judgment by the process of execution, it may be right that it should be in a position of its own motion to initiate the process that might lead to an administration order. As I have already indicated, that is on all fours with Section 4 of the Act of 1971. It is what would be secured by our amendment to Amendment No. 64. So I ask Mr. Solicitor to reconsider that in that context, which may well give him everything that he wants or everything that the Lord Chancellor's Department and he and his advisers think may be beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the serious consequences which we know this may have for judgment creditors, non-judgment creditors and the debtor, even if they were to say to the court, "No. Do not make this order", it is difficult to see how this can be the right approach to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that in reconsidering the other parts of this amendment, as the Solicitor-General has undertaken to do, he will also consider these points as part of his overall consideration of whether we should have the clause and, if so, what the precise terms and effect of it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until we have had his thinking on the points on which he has undertaken to think again and, I hope, those which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
have put to him, this is our view. I hope that the way that I have put it will also give the lie to one other suggestion made by the Solicitor-General—namely, that this is a political battle. If the voting ends up on party lines, as seems possible, I assure him that it will be because we, on our side, attach more weight to the views of the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it will assist the hon. and learned Member, I was never making the suggestion that it was a political battle. I was saying the reverse. I was merely regretting that, at one stage, political overtones had appeared to creep into an argument where they had no place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad about that, but I will nevertheless say what I was about to say so that it is clear. It still appears that the voting on this matter may end up on party lines—that is, one party voting for one thing and the other party voting for another. If that is so, as far as we are concerned it will be because we attach great importance to the views expressed by the people who are the practitioners and who know most about how it works and also because, in the light of the opportunity we have had to consider them and their application, we agree with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out to the Committee that there are errors in the amendments as they appear on the Notice Paper in respect of the references to line numbers. I have arranged for the necessary corrections to be made. They are not necessarily printing errors, in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also point out that, although we discussed earlier which amendments the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) was proposing to move should Amendment (	<i>a</i>) be carried, I shall certainly allow him to move Amendment (	<i>b</i>), since they are connection. But, should Amendment (	<i>a</i>) be defeated, I think we should proceed directly to Amendment (	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to you for your guidance on that matter, Mr. English. I do not know where the errors to which you referred originated but, whether they be printing errors or not, it is not inappropriate to pay tribute to the printers, who have done a fantastic job in reproducing passages which, at times, must be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
totally unintelligible to anyone who is not up to his neck in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed this set of amendments at considerable length and we have, I think, made a large number of important points. I hope, therefore, that we will succeed in persuading the Government to accept Amendments (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>), though, as you have rightly said, if Amendment (	<i>a</i>) fails, then Amendment (	<i>b</i>) would fall. Amendment (	<i>c</i>) is a separate point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to try to convince the Minister, not only to look carefully at the points we have made between now and Report stage but that there is still an immense amount of work to be done on this Bill to sort out its structure. We hope to persuade him to accept Amendments (a), (b) and (c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want also to make one general point of principle. In the light of the philosophical discussion we had last time, based on simple accounting principles, it seems to us that this part of the Bill is not really concerned with the administration of anyone's estate. It is as simple as that. That being so, it seems unfortunate that those words should appear. I hope we can persuade the Solicitor-General and the Minister that that is the situation and that it would be right to correct it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is a general one. In a sense, the Solicitor-General at our last sitting either let the cat out of the bag or made abundantly clear what had not previously been apparent—namely, that the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
	<p>clause has nothing to do with making it easier for creditors to get their money, whereas in earlier stages that was what we thought the Government were trying to do. It seemed clear and, indeed, I think it was expressed in terms in a blinding flash of revelation at one point. If the clause does nothing to help creditors get their money, I think that it could make it more difficult for them to get their money. Obviously that would have important repercussions on the simple amendments concerned with monetary limits with which we started at the beginning of the Committee stage, since the raising of monetary limits also makes it more difficult for creditors to get their money.</p>
	<p>If, as we believe, the number of alternatives has steadily diminished, that would make the situation worse, if anything, and monetary limits will need to be carefully looked at again before Report stage. Other than that, while we shall come to discuss other matters when we come to discuss "clause stand part"—and I hope that that will be a short debate—at present we do not wish to oppose the Minister's amendment by our amendments.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 68, in page 8, line 6, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but no such order shall be made unless and until every creditor named in such list has been given notice thereof and afforded full opportunity to be heard on the question of whether an order should be made and any other creditor wishing to be heard thereon has been afforded full opportunity to be heard thereon".</p></blockquote>
The amendment falls within a much narrower compass than the discussion that we have just had. The Committee will appreciate that nothing said on the previous group of amendments is typical of this one. What we are dealing with here is just the second stage of what is proposed. The first stage is the power of a court to order a list of creditors, which is, in fact, the first stage under the present administration order procedure—that of a debtor making that request and, with it, filing a list of creditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are now dealing with is the second stage which will follow the powers which are to be given if Clause 8 remains in the Bill, under subsection (1). We need, therefore, to look at subsection (2) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, on receipt of the list referred to in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) above, it appears to the court that the debtor's whole indebtedness amounts to not more than the amount for the time being specified … the court may make such an order in respect of the debtor's estate."</p></blockquote>
I digress to request the Solicitor-General to ask Parliamentary Counsel to have a look at that drafting. I am not quite sure whether it is apt to say that the court may make such an order. The only order referred to here is in parentheses and I think the wording could be improved. But the intention is that if, after taking the step provided for in subsection (1), the court finds that the debtor's whole indebtedness is within the limit of its jurisdiction for the time being—presumably after all the requirements are satisfied—it may then make what we may call, compendiously, an administration order. The amendment does not disturb that power, but it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but no such order shall be made unless and until every creditor named in such list has been given notice thereof and afforded full opportunity to be heard on the question of whether an order should be made and any other creditor wishing to be heard thereon has been afforded full opportunity to be heard thereon."</p></blockquote>
There is nothing technical about that. It means exactly what it says. A layman would, I think, know what it meant. The reason for it is simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
The making of an administration order may have very serious consequences for a judgment creditor because, as has been said all through these debates, it has the effect of putting into suspense any remedies which the judgment creditor may have. The Committee will have noticed that I said not "any other remedies" but "any remedies", because we no longer regard this as a remedy for the judgment creditor. What it does is to put into suspense all remedies which he would otherwise have had, and that is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the only respect in which it is so serious. The Payne Committee considered other aspects to which I referred briefly at our last sitting. We are considering the self-employed particularly, so we are talking about a man in business on his own account who may well run on credit the whole time. One of the considerations that the judgment creditors have in mind is that, if he does not pay them what he owes, they have the county court process to establish a claim and to recover it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Payne Committee pointed out, when an administration order has been made, a person who might otherwise have given credit to a self-employed person may well say that he cannot because now that the administration order is made he has no means of recovering his money and will have to queue up with all the others for whatever little there may be. So parties not party to the proceedings will nevertheless be affected by the order, and in such a way as may have repercussions for all creditors, including the judgment creditors. If the people who would normally advance on credit to the debtor to enable him to keep going, thus enabling him to continue making money out of which he may pay his judgment creditors, stop giving that credit which they would otherwise give for business reasons but now, for equally good business reasons, they stop giving credit, that may reflect adversely on the judgment creditors, who have already been prevented from pursuing the remedies that they would normally be allowed to pursue under the county court provisions relating to the enforcement of judgment debtors in the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is sufficient to show that all the classes referred to in the amendment are people who could be adversely affected by the order or whose actions may have serious consequences for everybody concerned if an order is made. It seems not only fair but eminently sensible that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
should all be heard, if they so wish, before an order is made. We also feel that it is only fair to the court, because we are asking the court to do a difficult thing. We talk about it, but the court has to make the order. This is not an easy matter for courts, and we feel that, from the point of view of everybody concerned with by the order and also for the person called upon to make the order, it would be right for the powers given under subsection (2) to be qualified as they would be if Amendment No. 68 were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point which the hon. and learned Gentleman has just made, and I do not think that there is any difference between us about the purpose which the amendment seeks to achieve. Perhaps one characteristic of debates of this kind in Committee is that, as we proceed, we find more and more where the real issue lie and, in the process, more and more common ground, and we all become a little less dogmatic as we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier stage the hon. and learned Gentleman was fair enough to say that to some extent the point which he is making was provided for in our Amendment No. 64, which says that the court should not make an order of its own motion without giving the parties to those proceedings an opportunity of being heard. So there is the principle quite clearly spelled out in the Bill and, ultimately, if it reaches the statute book, in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only remaining question is whether we need to say any more in the Bill itself or whether, if any more requires to be said, it should be said in rules. Clearly, we can say anything further which is required to be said in the rules, and it is all there—as the hon. and learned Gentleman would agree—in the existing rules, the Administration Order Rules 1971. It may assist the Committee if I refer to the rules where this matter is dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rule 7 provides that where the court has received a list and proposes to go on to consider the making of an order,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the registrar shall appoint a day for the hearing at which the making of an administration order is to be considered and shall give not less than 10 clear days' notice thereof to the debtor and to each creditor mentioned in Form 1 or 2."</p></blockquote>
Rule 8, headed "Objection to Debts", states
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any creditor to whom notice has been sent under rule 7 and who objects to any debt included in the Form 1 or 2 shall not less than five clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
days before the day appointed … give notice of his objection to the registrar, to the debtor,"</p></blockquote>
and so on. Sub-rule (2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By leave of the court an objection to a debt may be considered although notice of the object ion has not been given."</p></blockquote>
Rule 10, sub-rule (1)—this is on the day appointed—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any creditor, whether or not he has received notice…may attend and prove his debt and…object to any debt which the debtor has included in the Form 1 or 2".</p></blockquote>
Sub-rule (5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any creditor whose debt is admitted or proved, and, by leave of the court, any creditor the proof of whose debt has been adjourned, shall be entitled to be heard and to adduce evidence."</p></blockquote>
We do not need to go in further detail into whether those rules will be adequate protection to meet all the points which the hon. and learned Gentleman has in mind, because those rules would certainly have to be reconsidered and revised if this Bill were to reach the statute book because we would have to provide for the procedure in the Bill. There is a later amendment which I assume the hon. and learned Gentleman will move on which we shall discuss who are the proper bodies to make those rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with the question whether we want to put any more into the statute about this, bearing in mind that it will now be there, or whether one would be content to leave anything further which needs to be said to rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point which the hon. and learned Gentleman has made more than once in these debates that if one wants to say something there is a lot to be said for saying it in a statute so that those who have to administer the statute can see it. Again, one has to keep a balance. If too much is crammed into a statute it becomes very difficult to follow and much more complicated for those who have to read it, particularly laymen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own preference is to leave anything further which has to be said to be said in the rules. But there is a great deal to consider between now and Report. Perhaps it would be easier to decide immediately before the Report stage whether the Bill as it is then likely to emerge and the various things which have happened to it will be sufficient to meet the point the hon. and learned Gentleman has made and if, as he says, at that stage he is not content with what is then emerging he can say so. But he may wish to defer further consideration of the point until we know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
the results of the other reconsiderations. take the point he has made. I think that there is nothing between us in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Solicitor-General. My concern is to ensure that the parcel of procedure, whether contained in the statute book or the rules, will ensure that what is said in the amendment happens or what is limited in this amendment does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend to the hon. and learned Gentleman the proposition that this is the right balance. The detailed working out of it and how effect is to be given to what is said in the amendment is a matter for rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his new subsection (1) the hon. and learned Gentleman has taken the step of specifying in the statute certain things. How effect is to be given to those provisions is a matter for the rules and I do not suggest that the statute should be cluttered up with a lot of details of how effect is to be given to the requirements of subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>). I commend to him the repetition of that process in subsection (2). Let us put in subsection (2) the basic requirements which are set out in my Amendment No. 66. Let us put that much in the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, of course, there is the working out of how notice is to be given, whether there is to be a day appointed as in Rule 10. There is not much between us, but I ask the Solicitor-General to consider whether we have struck the balance in this amendment. Subject to that, I readily respond to what clearly he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 69, in page 8, line 11, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an amendment to which we referred in the main debate at our previous sitting on the Government's first amendment to the clause. It contains what seems to us to be the most objectionable feature of the clause as a whole. Indeed, it is a curious device which the Government have now suggested the House should approve. On the one hand, under the earlier parts of Clause 8, the court is given the power with a view to making an administration order to order the debtor to furnish the court
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
with a list of all his creditors and the amounts owing to them respectively. On the other hand, suddenly, in subsection (4) one finds that if this happens this is said to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"an act of bankruptcy by him".</p></blockquote>
The oddest feature of the whole matter is that it refers to an act of bankruptcy by him. Certainly he has not done anything at all except furnish a list of his creditors. I can see, Mr. English, that you appear to find this a matter for some amusement. It is a very curious proposal, indeed. He certainly has not done anything in the way of an act of bankruptcy. He has simply drawn up a list of his creditors. If every time one drew up a list of one's creditors one immediately found oneself bankrupt, I for one would be in a bad way. It is, of course, as my hon. and learned Friend points out, the fact that the order is made. So perhaps it is not quite as bad as I was suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worse, because whereas the drawing up of the list would be an act by the debtor, and therefore might be described as an act by him, the making of the order is not an act by him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. and learned Friend that in that respect it is a great deal worse. Therefore, Mr. English, we are not at all clear how these two extraordinary words should have appeared at the end of subsection (4). Even if they are removed, the basic point still remains. It is highly objectionable that we should create a situation where, in the circumstances described in the first part of the clause, that itself becomes an act of bankruptcy, whether by him, the court or anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, if this mechanism were to come into operation in a particular case, the protection for the debtor given by the Bankruptcy Act 1914—the notice to deal with requirements, to counterclaim or to set out conditions on which the creditor may petition—would not operate in this case. But perhaps Mr. Solicitor could confirm whether that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not quite follow the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will say it again. It may be that I threw it out rather rapidly. As I understand it, if this mechanism operates—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
that is to say, the drawing up of the list constitutes an act of bankruptcy—the provisions and protections for the debtor which are set out in the 1914 Act with regard to periods of notice and so on, do not apply. I may have misunderstood this. If they apply, obviously that is not quite so bad. However, for reasons which we have put forward at various stages in the Cornmittee, we believe that this is an extremely undesirable development. Indeed, we are not clear at the moment why the Government should have thought it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I move this amendment and look forward to a response from the Solicitor-General saying that, in the light of the more congenial atmosphere pervading this morning, he feels the arguments are overwhelming and that the Government's proposal is misconceived. We shall then suggest that that is not a bad change of heart on his part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we are all more congenial after a substantial night's sleep, though I concede that some of us have had a longer night's sleep than others. I think I can assist the hon. Gentleman. It was not wholly capricious on the part of those who drafted the Bill that this provision was included. It was intended to meet a problem which might face creditors. As has been pointed out, the provisions about which we are talking operate as a protection to debtors in important respects. It might well have been that a creditor would feel that he had been deprived of alternative methods of enforcing his debt. In particular, he might have said after an order had been made "If I had thought that anyone was contemplating this order, I would have applied to bring bankruptcy proceedings".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an interval of time between the making of the order for the list of creditors and the making of the administration order. What it was intended to do was to provide an opportunity during that interval for the creditor, if he so wished, to bring bankruptcy proceedings. The difficulty there might have been that there was no act of bankruptcy on which he could proceed. Therefore, the intention was to provide him with an act of bankruptcy for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, on the face of it, it appears to be illogical, because it is not an act at all. However, an act of bankruptcy is a technical term. It really means a trigger mechan ism. Again, I have to be careful. Whenever
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
I try to phrase these matters in layman's language, I get into trouble. But it is a kind of trigger mechanism which enables a creditor to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. All that was intended was that we should add to the various kinds of acts of bankruptcy which are listed in the Act of 1914 one further act which would be available to the creditor if he wanted to initiate bankruptcy proceedings during the interval between the making of the order for a list of creditors and the making of the administration order. That was the purpose behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an act by the debtor which he would need to establish, and this, clearly, is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it would not need to be established as an act by the debtor. It is an act of bankruptcy that one has to establish, as defined in the relevant statute—whatever the relevant statute might be. In other words, one cannot present a petition for bankruptcy unless the debtor has placed himself or has been placed in a position in which the conditions for presenting that petition are favourable. Normally, that means that the debtor has done something, and here the act itself would not be an act of the debtor at all. All one could say if one were debating the philosophy of it is that the debtor has placed himself in a position in which he obviously has an unfulfilled debt, and the court might want to make an order against him. The purpose, however, was simply to enable the creditor, if he so wished, to bring bankruptcy proceedings before the administration order was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the first time that this has appeared in legislation. It is lifted almost directly from Section 4(3) of the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971, where one finds precisely the same situation. Where an order is made against a debtor to provide a list of his creditors that shall, for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, be an act of bankruptcy by him. That is the purpose behind it, and the hon. Gentleman may think that it is a purpose of which creditors might be minded to approve. It is also, incidentally, in Section 21 of the Administration of Justice Act 1965, but, since that arises only where the debtor has applied for an administration order, one can say there is a relevant difference because the whole process has been activated by an act of the debtor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman explain why action which would result in bankruptcy cannot be taken by the creditor other than by this means, why it was thought that that would be so, and why it was thought necessary to have an additional method?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is simply that, under the Act of 1914, the creditor cannot present a bankruptcy petition until there has previously been an act of bankruptcy. The structure of the 1914 Act is that first, there is the situation in which the debtor has in some way patently declared himself to be insolvent-1 have to be very careful how I paraphrase these provisions—but that is broadly the beginning. The Act lists the situations in which that obtains and calls them acts of bankruptcy—for example, if a man tries to avoid paying his creditors or something of that sort—and then it says that, where he has committed any act of bankruptcy on that list, the creditor may petition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, of course, that there may be other acts of bankruptcy available, but there may not. There is only a limited time between the making of the order for the list of creditors and the making of the administration order, and the creditor may find it difficult within that time to ascertain whether or not there has been another act of bankruptcy. So the intention was to say "All right, we will give the creditor an opportunity to bring in a bankruptcy petition during that period, and there can be no argument about whether there has been an act of bankruptcy because of the making of the list itself shall count for that purpose."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I am reminded that the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971 does not contain the only example in which an act by someone else counts as an act of bankruptcy by the debtor. Where goods are seized by the sheriff and held for 21 days under Section 1(1) (	<i>e</i>) of the Act of 1914, that, too, shall be an act of bankruptcy by the debtor. So the whole thing is not a wholly foreign concept to the bankruptcy system, and that is why it was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that—I do not want to spend a great deal of time on what may transpire to be an academic discussion—I agree with the hon. Gentleman that an attempt to plaster over the wound may infect the wound itself and create more problems than are solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
I was particularly impressed by the intervention of the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) in our discussion of Amendment (	<i>c</i>) to our Amendment No. 64. If the making of an order for a list of creditors could have the effect of its counting as an act of bankruptcy, clearly it could prejudice the debtor. The argument that I was attempting to produce at that time was that it probably would not prejudice the debtor. But, clearly, with this subsection in, it could, and that leaves the alternative of trying to produce some provision for notice, which may have all sorts of complications and disadvantages, including his being confronted with a situation where he has committed an act of bankruptcy without ever having had notice that it was contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Balancing all the considerations, I should like an opportunity to reconsider this matter. It may well be that the price we pay for the inclusion of this provision is too high for the benefits to be derived from it. If the hon. Gentleman will afford me the opportunity, I should like to think about the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, having dealt with Finance Bills for 10 years, I tend to be excessively sordid on these matters.

	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
appear on the Amendment Paper. It was a case of people thinking independently but to the same effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not deny it. Late one night I saw New Clause 7 and consequently realised that amendments would be necessary. I did not look to see whether they were already down, however, and thus one has this overlapping of Amendments Nos. 47, 48, 72 and 71. We recognise the need for these amendments and support the Government in them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that indication. Perhaps for the benefit of my hon. Friends I may say in two sentences what is the purpose of this group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present rule-making in relation to administration orders is with the Lord Chancellor. Rule-making in relation to most matters in the county court is with the County Court Rule Committee. The purpose of this group of amendments is to transfer the power from the Lord Chancellor to the County Court Rule Committee, as in the case of all other county court rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That, the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have already indicated that the widespread effect—if that is the right expression— which we had earlier has covered the main points we wish to make. There are still a great many aspects of the clause which need to be considered should we not succeed in removing it. But the position still remains, which is also the clearly expressed view of the Joint Working Party of the Law Reform and Procedure Committee of the Bar and the Law Reform Committee of the Council of the Law Society with the position of Justice not having recently been determined by the Government—and Justice may well express the same view—that there may be no advantage in including this clause in the Bill and we, therefore, feel it should be omitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that, despite the undertakings we have had from the Minister and the various changes which have been

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One or two points arise on this clause on which we would like ministerial assistance. It would help if the Ministers could give us some indication of how they see it working and what difference it would make to present procedures. I have an idea—and I put it in that form since I have had no opportunity to check it again—that the court already has power where there is an administration order for those proceedings to be turned into bankruptcy proceedings. I realise that that is also an inexact form of terminology, but I cannot remember how one would term it. I have a similar recollection from the civil judicial statistics that that power would seem to be rarely used. The answer to those two points may be that there is nothing remotely approaching it and, if so, I have got hold of the wrong end of the stick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More to the point, what about the amounts? Does Clause 9 mean what it says—that where an administration order has been made, and where a person fails to maintain the instalments that he or she is order to pay, a receiving order in bankruptcy may be made, with all the ensuing</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
	<p>advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 3.</p>
	<p>consequences, regardless of the amount of the debt. Or, must the total of the debts in respect of which the administration order was made be at least £300? If the answer to the second question is yes, the total must be at least £300, assuming that the limit of £300 is the minimum on which a bankruptcy petition can be found to stand, where is that to be found in law?</p>
	<p>Clause 9 seems to say, in terms, that wherever there is an administration order, regardless of the amount of any individual debt or total of debt, if the debtor fails to keep up the instalments he may have been ordered to make, a receiving order may be made. If that is not so, the effect of this clause is limited since we are dealing with small cases, 	<i>ex hypothesi,</i> which is what administration orders are for. So if this is subject to a limit of £A3;300, the effect of Clause 9 may be more limited than it would seem.</p>
	<p>If, on the other hand, there is no financial limit governing the implementation of Clause 9, one could get a curious situation. Clause 9 is obviously 	<i>interrorem.</i> It is holding over the heads of a debtor the threat of bankruptcy proceedings. At the start of these Committee proceedings, we agreed that it was a good thing to hold that threat over the head of a debtor and that is why we did not want the limits increased to £300. We would rather the limit had been increased only to £200 so that that was a threat that could be held over the heads of small debtors.</p>
	<p>However, if there is no financial limit on the operation of Clause 9, one has this curious sequence of events. An administration order is made in respect of debts totalling £250, a situation in which neither an individual creditor nor all the creditors together jointly could have initiated bankruptcy proceedings. But they could produce that same result, though after many to-ings and fro-ings in between and a lot of unnecessary expense by first, proceeding to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
judgment; secondly, applying for an administration order; thirdly, hoping that the administration order would not be maintained; and, finally, if it was not maintained, ending with bankruptcy proceedings. That would seem rather odd.</p>
	<p>We accept the sense of keeping the possibility of bankruptcy proceedings as a threat to be held over the debtor to persuade him to pay. The force of that argument is greatest in relation to the financial limits under Clause l. It is strange that they should be rejected when we advance them in connection with Clause 1 but employed here in Clause 9.</p>
	<p>Next, what about the deposit? I have no idea whether a deposit has to be paid or whether a receiving order is made. Does it have to be paid, and if not, why not? Again, one will find that creditors at the end of this long! chain will have the disadvantage of not having to pay that large deposit, though if they want to initiate this process at a much earlier stage, the doing of which might cut out a lot of unnecessary work and expense for everybody, they would have to find a large deposit. What is the sense of that?</p>
	<p>If the deposit has to be paid where will it come from? Clause 9 (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any fee payable in respect of the making of a receiving order … shall be a first charge on any money which has been paid into court under the administration order …".</p></blockquote>
Suppose there is not enough money to pay that fee. Is the position in bankruptcy that unless the fees that have to be paid on the making of a receiving order are paid the matter does not proceed? if so, would that be the position under Clause 9? Or can the matter proceed even though neither the deposit nor the fee is paid? Unless it can, that would render largely nugatory the apparent attractions of this clause.</p>
	<p>Lastly, what is the position of the judgment creditor and the other creditors here? Nothing is said about them in the clause. Is,it intended that, in and by the rules, provision shall be made for them, or some of them, to have a say before this step is taken because, though on the face of it, it may often be the right step to take, it would be a bold man who would postulate that it would always be in the interests of everybody, particularly the creditors, for it to be taken. Is it intended that provision should be made for other interests to be had, or all interests to be had, and if so, what sort of provisions have the Government in mind?</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
	<p>Those are just some of the thoughts that occur to me, but we should appreciate the assistance of the Solicitor-General or the Minister on those points, plus any other guidance they can give us as to the circumstances in which they see this clause being prayed in aid and the manner in which it would then work.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has asked four questions, if my arithmetic is correct. I shall endeavour to give the answers. If at the end I have overlooked any of them, I am sure he will remind me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, he asked, is there any provision existing elsewhere for turning an administration order into bankruptcy proceedings? The answer is, "No". This is the first occasion on which that procedure has been introduced into legislation. Elsewhere, all the court can do by way of a sanction for non-compliance with an administration order is to revoke it. When we discussed Clause 8, perhaps we all proceeded on an assumption, which was perhaps a little out of balance, that we were really introducing nothing that might assist creditors. We are introducing a new weapon into the armoury of creditors. This is the first time that that provision has been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. and learned Gentleman asked whether it was possible to make a bankruptcy receiving order, whatever the amount of the debt, or was there some financial limit on it? There is no financial limit. The order can be made whatever the amount of the debt, and so here again we are adding teeth to the creditor which do not already exist for him. In that case, the hon. and learned Gentleman said, why not provide for bankruptcy proceedings without limit anyway? Why should it be necessary for creditors to apply for an administration order and then wait to see whether it has been complied with and then make an application under Clause 9?.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one does provide what could be teeth of a new kind to creditors which can be used to inflict a substantial bite, perhaps where one is dealing with sums below those where normally bankruptcy proceedings would be activated, there should be a proper balancing protection for the debtor. One does not want to proceed in those circumstances directly to the making of a receiving order. It is appropriate that the administration order should be made first
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
and that the debtor should have an opportunity of complying with it and only if he fails to comply should the court proceed to consider whether he should be made bankrupt for a debt which, in other circumstances, would not have subjected him to the risk of bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. and learned Gentleman says that there is normally a fee payable in bankruptcy proceedings. I understand that usually it is payable on the filing of the petition. The intention under Clause 9 is that it shall not be payable because if one requires the payment of a fee, one might put oneself in the situation which the hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned and the whole of these provisions would be rendered nugatory. So it is not intended that it should be payable, but it is provided that if there are any assets then the fee should be a first charge on assets. That is the purpose of subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. and learned Gentleman asked, is it intended that there should be provision for other creditors to make representations before the court proceeds to the making of a receiving order? That is what is envisaged, but it seems to be a matter for rules, since it now seems to be common ground that the appropriate form of the statute should provide for the making of the rules by the County Court Rule Committee. One would hope that it would address itself to that principle. It does not seem again to be something which one ought to provide for in the statute. But that was the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have answered all four of the hon. and learned Gentleman's questions. He is still looking slightly puzzled. Perhaps he will enlighten me as to the source of his puzzlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled. I am obliged to the Solicitor-General and I look forward to the opportunity to consider what he has said when I see it in print. It is not easy to absorb all these matters in an instant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am puzzled because he used a phrase to the effect that Clause 9, in effect, gives teeth to the creditor. I do not think that it is giving a remedy to a creditor. It is saying what the court may do if its own orders are not complied with. It is not a method of enforcement. It is simply that the court is empowered to say that if its order is not obeyed it will, instead, create a bankrupt. I think the court already has substantial powers for rescinding the order and depriving the debtor of the benefit of
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
an administration order if he does not keep up payments. That is the nature of Clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, even if it were giving teeth to a creditor, it seems rather remarkable that one takes away the teeth that the creditor now has, namely, his ability to bring a bankruptcy petition in respect of any sum of £50 or upwards. One then gives them back to him at the end of this long trail, if the trail does not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What seems clear from the Solicitor-General's remarks is that in the course of that long trail various expenses will arise and those expenses will all be a first charge on what little may have been recovered in the course of the carrying out of the order. We are talking in terms of the likelihood of the recovery of small sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I was looking puzzled, it was because I do not find it easy to picture in my mind's eye how this will work out. In so far as I have a picture of how it may work, there are a number of aspects, including those which I have mentioned, about which I am not at all happy. However, I would not wish to pursue the matter at the moment. What I want to do it to take the opportunity to consider what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned earlier this morning that the Solicitor-General seemed to take the view in our debate on Clause 8 that it was not something to help creditors, indeed, that the purpose was to help debtors. I described that as a sudden revelation, which obviously altered our view on it. I understand from what he is now saying that he is somewhat modifying that view. I am far from clear that he is right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being anxious to establish what the hon. and learned Gentleman said previously,! procured a copy of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Ninth Sitting and, alas, found to my horror that following column 442 there were two blank pages followed by column 447, followed by two blank pages, followed by column 455. Whether this has been censored, I am not sure. It may be that this is just a one-off copy which I happened to have got hold of. I understand that my hon. and learned Friend has a complete copy. Clearly, therefore, it is not a question of censorship; merely my bad luck.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to assist hon. Gentlemen? It appears that the hon. Gentleman's copy is not unique; there are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
other copies with blank pages: But there are copies with all the pages complete. Therefore, the short answer is that anybody who finds that he has blank pages at that point should throw that copy away and take another copy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear that those copies were not designed specially for the Opposition!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not sure whether it was, as the Americans would put it, custom-built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of great interest to bodies outside. We shall no doubt wish to send copies of the 	<i>Official Report</i> to them, and other Members not on the Committee who have to intervene on Report may wish to send copies to people. If they are unaware that there are some with blank pages they may well send them to outside bodies. These outside bodies may be working with those copies at two or three o'clock in the morning and not be greatly helped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the offending copies will be removed, both from the Vote Office and from the Committee so that anyone not in the Committee inadvertently sending them to outside bodies will not create the problem I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say on behalf of the officials of the House that we are grateful to the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
The amendment has the effect of delaying the coming into effect of the Act until such date as the Secretary of State may order by statutory instrument. Originally it would have come into force on receiving the Royal Assent with the exceptions of Clauses I, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 10(4) and the schedules, the date of coming into force of which was to be specified by the Secretary of State by order made by statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a number of important amendments proposed and these will require rules in respect of the new and amended clauses as well as those already excepted from having effect on Royal Assent. Therefore, the Government consider that it is appropriate to provide for the Secretary of State to specify the appropriate date for the coming into force of each clause and schedule of the Bill. Different dates can be specified for different provisions. Obviously, we are anxious to provide for rules as soon as possible; but we have to await the constitution of the form of rule committee which this Committee may think appropriate, and which we shall be debating on New Clause 6. Clearly, it would be wrong to prevent them from participating in the rule-making which will have, to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"only sections 1, 4, 7 and this section and Schedule 1".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this amendment is simply to reward this subsection in the interests of clarity. It does not change its effect in any way. With the introduction of new clauses which do not affect Scotland, it is now more appropriate to word the subsection so that it refers to clauses and schedules' which extend to Scotland rather than those that do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>499</span>
the Companies Act 1948 certain provisions. For example, Clause 10(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Sections 5 and 6 above shall have effect as if contained in the Bankruptcy Act 1914; and section 7 above shall have effect as if contained in the Companies Act 1948."</p></blockquote>
You will recall, Mr. English, that when we considered Clause 7, which was related to the Companies Act, we ran into considerable controversy as to the meaning of certain words in the subsection which it is now suggested should be incorporated in the Companies Act; and, in particular, the question whether a disqualified director
	<br><blockquote><p>" shall not, without the leave of the court, be a director of or in any way, whether directly or indirectly ".—</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee C, 10th June 1976, c. 399.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point at issue here is whether a director is really excluded by that clause or whether some ruling by the Lord Chancellor relates to it. The more I have considered this in the light of our subsequent discussions, the more I think that the interpretation put by the Lord Chancellor on the wording which this clause now seeks to import into the Companies Act 1948 and which is said to exist in this and related legislation is quite extraordinary. I thought it would be helpful, therefore, to give notice that when we consider these points on Report and, in particular, whether that section should be incorporated in the Companies Act by means of this clause, we shall wish to pursue this more then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, in dealing with this matter in column 399. quoted the Lord Chancellor as an authoritative reference on this point. I may be misinformed, but I understand that that is based on a single Australian case. I also understand that, if there are no other cases, that one may indeed be taken as relevant. But this is an area which must be cleared up. It is very unsatisfactory to incorporate Clause 7 by means of the clause we are now discussing into the legislation, when clearly, the wording of the clause is totally contrary to the view expressed by the Lord Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that on any common sense or technical basis it can be defended, and it seems that we have un-
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
earthed here an aspect of company law which really should be cleared up on Report. I realise that difficult repercussions are involved, but it should not be beyond the wit of the Government thoroughly to consider the matter before Report so that if we agree to the clause—and I do not propose to oppose it now—we shall have an opportunity to ensure that it brings into operation something where the use of the words is not clearly contradicted by the practice which has been established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the clause is to extend the time limit which is imposed by Section 1(1)(	<i>g</i>) of the 1914 Act for compliance with the bankruptcy notice. At the moment, the time limit is seven days and we propose to extend it to 10 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should outline the situation which arises under the current law. The provision of the particular section of the 1914 Act that a debtor shall commit an act of bankruptcy if witiiin seven days after service of bankruptcy notice he fails either to comply with the requirements of notice or to satisfy the court that he has a valid counter claim set off or cross
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the sum ordered to be paid has also to be construed in the light of Rule 137 of the Bankruptcy Rules 1952, which provides that if the debtor has such a counter claim set off or cross demand he has to file an affidavit to that effect with the registrar. In Rule 138 a time limit of three days is given for the filing of that affidavit. We intend, in fact, to seek amendment of the rule to increase the time limit of three days to seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the basic proposition, the extension from seven to 10 days, about which I know there is a difference of view because, for example, the Justice committee considers that the time limit should have been increased to 21 days, and 14 days as far as the affidavit was concerned under Rule 138. I considered this issue very carefully, and I think it is a question of balance between the interests of the creditors and those of the debtor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be an element of urgency about bankruptcy, and it is an important clement. One must try to prevent a debtor, once he knows that he faces bankruptcy, from utilising such time as may be available to defeat his creditors. He can. of course, arrange his affairs in that way, and if he is given a longer period of time it becomes an easier prospect. So we have to he on our guard against that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I should make in this context is that, in any event. before a creditor is in a position to issue a bankruptcy notice, he must have got a final judgment or order against the debtor, so that he has already had some time to obtain professional advice: the debtor does not suddenly find himself in this position. He has the opportunity to consider the possible consequences of non-payment of debt, including the possibility of bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I did take into account a real practical difficulty which confronts not only a debtor but those advising him. In a short period of seven days a weekend may intervene, which makes it very difficult and possibly unfair upon those who have to convey the advice and work over that period. It is perhaps more unfair to them than to the recipient of the advice. There is, of course, the question of non-advisability of advisers anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we thought that it was appropriate to extend the period from seven to 10 days and also it follows that Rule 138 should be suitably amended. I think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
three days for the preparation and filing of an affidavit in these circumstances is too short anyway. I hope therefore that the Committee will feel it appropriate to accept the proposition advanced in New Clause l.

The amendment seeks to substitute " ten " for " fourteen". As I have said, it is a question of balance and, having regard to the urgent nature of bankruptcy and the circumstances which govern all its aspects, I hope that the Opposition will not press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Under-Secretary has rightly said, this is essentially a question of balance and of weighing the actions which could be taken by the debtor in the period of notice in order to frustrate his creditors and, on the other hand, the need for him to have adequate notice to arrange to deal with the matter legitimately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What caused us to suggest "fourteen" rather than "ten" was simply the general deterioration in the postal services. It is not just the question of a weekend. There is no doubt that the service has become much worse. I give just two examples. The Minister was kind enough a short while ago to invite me to an official Government reception. Alas, although he no doubt allowed adequate time—I forget whether it was seven or 10 days—the invitation arrived after the event had taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Mr. Speaker's Department posted me a letter just before the last recess which I received last Thursday. That is obviously a matter for some concern. It is common experience that, whether the mail be second or first class, delays can be considerable and increasingly so. On a matter of such importance, I would have thought that it was more reasonable to lean on the generous rather than the ungenerous side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I take the point which the Minister has made about debtors making arrangements. If they were really determined to make arrangements to meet their creditors, they would do it in seven or 10 days as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
well as 14. It is more important that we ensure that adequate notice is given and therefore I would hope that we can persuade the Minister, in the general, amiable spirit that has prevailed this morning, to accept the amendment to the new Clause 9 should we move it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is related to Clause 7, the spirit and general purpose of which we have always accepted. We take the view that, if one must have such provisions as set out in Clause 7, one should also have a register. This new clause is taken from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 39 of the 1973 Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Solicitor-General will know that in Clauses 38 and 39 of that Bill provision was made for a disqualification procedure similar to that in Clause 7 of this Bill. I say " similar " since it was not identical but its objects were the same. As part of that package, it was considered important that there should be a register of disqualification. I cannot remember at what stage it was said, but I think that the Minister indicated that he agreed with that basic proposition. I do not think that he disagrees with the proposed wording, assuming that there will be a register of disqualifications, but if so that would be a drafting matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seem to recollect that at some stage it was proposed that the register should be in the Companies (No. 2) Bill. I urge the Minister not to adhere to that view, for two reasons. First, it would seem somewhat illogical to have the provisions for disqualification in one Act and the register of those disqualifications in another. If we must have the register, let us have it in this Bill following after the provisions which provide for disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it appears that the Bill will become a statute. We would look silly if we decided to deal with these two provisions, which virtually go hand in glove, in two different places and got only one through. In fact, if we got one through and not the other we would look doubly silly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the problem arises because it is a mixed Bill, dealing partly with bankruptcy and partly with companies. It might have been better to have both of these provisions in the Companies (No. 2) Bill. That can be dealt with by means of consolidating measures later on, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to join with us so that we can add the clause to the Bill and may be certain that it is put on the statute book as the corollary to Clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, there is nothing between us on this point. There is a slight error in the drafting in that the word "presented" should be "prescribed". But the difficulty basically is that the provision is too limited, as it can only be at present, whereas the
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
register I have in mind to introduce under the Companies (No. 2) Bill will be a comprehensive register of persons disqualified under Section 188 of the Companies Act, under Clause 7 of the Bill and under the Companies (No. 2) Bill. It would clearly he more logical and sensible to have it under that statute, otherwise one duplicates the position which one surely wants to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman has made about the Bill becoming law. I see few obstacles in the way of that. But I am also hopeful that we shall be able to proceed rapidly with the Companies (No. 2) Bill. If it becomes clear in, say, a couple of months that there are obstacles in the way of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, we will need to think again about the position. But I would much prefer to see the proposition in the Companies (No. 2) Bill. It is, as I say, a more comprehensive provision that I had in mind and, therefore, new Clause 5 should not be carried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. 'Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Under-Secretary says, I do not think that there is any difference between us on the case for such a register and therefore it is desirable, if we think that it is a suitable amendment to the law, that the law should be amended. It is a question of timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point which the Minister makes about whether this is a more narrow amendment than would otherwise he the case. None the less, we are incorporating into the Companies Act, under Clause 10, various earlier clauses. I would have thought that it was not beyond the possibilities of drafting—given the Long Title—to move a broader new clause than this one on Report and, by the same process, translate it from this Bill into the companies legislation. So it does not seem to me to be an overwhelming difficulty, though there are obviously technical points involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore I reinforce what my hon. and learned Friend says, that a bird in the hand is worth one—not even two—in the bush by saying a word or two about the position as regards the Companies (No. 2) Bill. The Minister will know that we are not totally opposed to the Bill. but, as time has progressed and as events have proceeded, it has become increasingly apparent that many bodies outside, not least a recently formed Conservative body, which published a large document
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>507</span>
only a few days ago, have expressed the view that the Bill requires radical amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), who is much concerned with these affairs in European circles as a member of the European Parliament, will no doubt have amendments to move which are likely to be substantial. He has long been advocating substantial changes in company law on particular lines which will be familiar to the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other sections of the Conservative Bill fell with the General Election, which I have already indicated we would wish to incorporate—for example, on the question of warehousing—but they raise very broad questions. Finally—and this is most important—the provisions in that legislation with regard to auditors will he, the most important aspect of it. My sole reason for putting these arguments forward is to persuade the Under-Secretary to accept this amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, and I allowed him to stray a little because I thought it was helpful to the progress of the Bill. But we are discussing the Bill, and this clause in particular, and not the Companies (No. 2) Bill. So I hope he will draw his remarks on that subject to a close.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand Mr. English. The sole purpose of going into all this is to persuade the Minister that he would be well advised to accept this amendment or, if he prefers, a broader amendment on Report in order to get the legislation through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that on the Companies (No. 2) Bill the question of auditors was being looked into by a committee of those concerned to see what changes needed to be made in the light of the London and County Securities report. My understanding is that the views of that committee will not be known until after the Companies (No. 2) Bill has been passed. It is absurd to say that reform of the auditing procedures must be rushed through when the most recent and important well-documented case, which is being studied by those concerned with these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Really, the hon. Gentleman is abusing the Committee.
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
This is something about which he could write a letter to the Minister because it concerns a totally different Bill. The subject matter of the Companies Bill is not what we are discussing now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are absolutely right, Mr. English, and I apologise if you feel I have spelled it out at too great a length. In essence, that is the point I wish to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of all of this, whilst we should not wish to do other than improve the legislation, it would be worthwhile accepting the new clause or, alternatively, giving an undertaking that a broader clause will be introduced on Report. I am sorry if I seemed to stray, it is not my usual practice to do so, but I am anxious to persuade the Minister to accept our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suffice it to say that, if there is a real element of risk, this is a matter which we can put right, not necessarily on Report but in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to assure the hon. Gentleman that we are absolutely 	<i>ad idem</i> on the principle here. I have noted the points he has made, and if it appears that the Companies (No. 2) Bill is in real jeopardy we shall clearly have to think again about the provision that should be imported into this Bill to cover the more limited register that would be available. It may be that we could extend it under the Bill. I doubt it. At all events, I shall bear this fact well in mind in the weeks ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we are agreed that if it goes to the Report stage it will be too late. It is only if it can be done in another place that the Government may manage to catch up with the matter. This is, of course, a House of Lords Bill. I am not absolutely sure whether necessarily there will be an opportunity in the House of Lords to do what the Minister suggests. Perhaps he will confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look into the position and make sure that the position is safeguarded, whether by fairly obvious enactment of the Companies (No. 2) Bill as may happen, or whether in the form of this Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move this new clause in the expectation that later I shall ask to withdraw it because I have been told, as have the working party, in writing, that the principle behind it is accepted. That being so, there are three main lines of consideration which call for thought at this stage and if we could have a discussion, on them now it would be most helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it is accepted that the rule-making power should be radically altered and that there should be an Insolvency Rules Committee which should—I now put it at its lowest—play a significant part in the making of all rules relating to insolvency matters. I have put it in that general form because whether it should be called a rule-making body, a consultative body or an advisory body has not yet been resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am saying what I am saying on the assumption that it is agreed on both sides of the Committee that there shall be a committee similar in nature to the already existing rule-making body which is from now on to play a significant part in the making of the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot put it higher than that because I accept that in this instance, as with all rule-making bodies, the Lord Chancellor must retain a veto. The final power of veto must be reserved to the Lord Chancellor. If one says that it would be a contradiction in terms to go on to call the rules committee a rule-making body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would not be strictly accurate. If what it does can be vetoed, it is not right for it to be called a rule-making body. I should hope that that would be the only here. I hope the Government will go limitation which would be introduced beyond mere consultation or advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very conscious of the fact that my new clause uses the word "consult", but I feel reasonably confident that nobody will take me to task on that because it is well known that the purpose of tabling the new clause was to provide a vehicle for discussion of this very important topic. To have attempted to do more than that and draft the appropriate provision without all the back-up machinery would have been over-ambitious. I accept that there are many considerations which must be weighed in the balance and great care
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>511</span>
and skill is necessary in the drafting of the provisions which set up the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it will not be said that the only right the body will have will be to be consulted. I want to see an initiating body, not a body which is simply called together when somebody thinks there is something to be consulted about. With respect to the Establishment, one has seen too much of the very limited interpretation which can be put on the words " consult " and " consultation".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I saw that often enough when I was a member of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. We asked various people to tell us what consultations had taken place in cases where there was a statutory requirement that there should be consultations before an order was laid. On more than one occasion it was said " We did tell them what was happening and that satisfies the requirement to consult. There was no point in asking what they thought about it because what we proposed could not he changed." That is the sort of argument that can he advanced on the meaning of "consult". I do not believe that we want to see that, nor do we want to see room for interpretation in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I am aware, with the one exception when there has been a certain amount of feeling when the veto has been exercised, everybody has taken the view that this is not a body simply to be consulted but that it is a working body which should take the initiative and play a leading and substantial part in the formulation of the rules. That makes sense, because they are the people who know best what is required. I hope that the body which is set up will have functions which go well beyond those indicated in the new clause presented by my hon. Friend and myself and that the only limitation on its activities will be the usual power of veto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put forward in the new clause a suggested composition for this body, but it is no more than a suggestion. In a letter to me the Minister set out a variation of this suggested composition. Tt had in common with New Clause 6 that the chairman should a judge of the Chancery Division. and that the other members should he a registrar of the High Court. a registrar of the county court, a barrister. a solicitor and an accountant. Basically the only difference
	<span class='label label-info column'>512</span>
is one barrister instead of two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to think that the numbers on the committee as proposed in New Clause 6, and in the letter from the Minster, are too small. We are dealing with very busy people who may not always be able to get together at the same time, and it would be a good idea to have enough people to cover that eventuality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with an area where there is nothing to be gained by limiting the size too much. I am against large committees and my inclination is, therefore, to have a committee as small as may be necessary to cover the subject. However. I think that in the new clause, and the Minister's suggestion, we have too few—first from the point of view of the expertise and practical experience which will he contained within the members who are present, and, secondly, for ensuring that adequate numbers are able to attend the meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe I am right in saying, although I have not checked this, that the composition suggested in my new clause, or that suggested by the Minister, would be considerably smaller than on the other similar rule-making bodies we had in mind when putting forward this proposal. I do not want to add to the arguments I have already put forward, but I believe that a larger committee would have considerable merit. I ask the Minister to consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point is this. We have had a great deal of discussion about the deposit. The deposit is fixed by the rule-making body. It is of great importance—I am sure no one will query that—to the working of everything that we have been discussing. It is all very well for us to say what can and cannot happen as a matter of law. We should be most concerned with how will it actually happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know now that there is a factor which has nothing to do with the Bill—it does not appear in the Bill and is not directly related to anything in the Bill—which will have a practical significance and effect on what we are discussing; that is, the level of the deposit. That is fixed by the rule-making body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider what I put to him previously but which he has so far rejected. For goodness' sake, let this new rule making body consider what change there should be in the deposit. I know the importance of it to the Depart-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I1230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>513</span>
ment. I know that it is considered to be something that will help to make a saving in costs and labour, which is one of the aims and objects of the Bill, but it cannot make any difference to future finances either of the Department or the country if another two, three or six months is taken before this is done. Of course, it is important to the Government. It is also important to those who are directly affected by our actions—all the judgment debtors and creditors and those who have to conduct their cases for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From all those points of view, surely it is better that this matter should be dealt with by the new rules committee. Whatever answer it produces must be accepted. because the Government have gone as far as could be expected towards meeting everyone's interests and representations. They have provided the new rules committee. If that committee recommends £90, so be it. That will have been considered by the kind of committee that those representations say should consider these matters. I suggest that if the Government are not going to do that, but will do this, the most important thing of all, before the new rule-making body conies into existence, that would be open to serious criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that, first. the Minister will he able to give us the Government's thinking on the proposal that there should be an Insolvency Rules Committee, and secondly, that he will offer some comments on those three aspects of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept the principle of the concepts that have been outlined by the hon. and learned Gentleman. I have said before that we think the consultation must be full and meaningful, and there is absolutely no objection to a body of this kind initiating proposals. I therefore hope I have clarified that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal that we will be making on Report is a substantial departure in respect of this aspect of ruling-making from that practice which has prevailed up to now, and which was outlined by the hon. and learned Gentleman. He adverted to the letter which I wrote to him about the composition of the committee. My mind is not closed about that matter. It is right that we should consult
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
the Bar Council, the Law Society, and the accountancy bodies, and letters have been sent to these professional organisations informing them of the proposal. We shall consider what they say and what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a suggestion that the rule-making committee, subject to the Lord Chancellor's veto, should be provided for and that it should have overall oversight of the position. There is a problem here, and that is why we opted for the advisory committee. The Opposition opted originally for an advisory committee along these lines. I think that they accept the point that I am about to make, namely, that the bankruptcy and company winding-up rules are not exclusively concerned with court procedure such as similar rule-making bodies, in the Supreme Court and the county court. They are exclusively concerned with the procedure of those particular courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These rules also refer to the duties of official receivers and the exercise by the Secretary of State of his powers under the Act. Although we shall take note of what members of the advisory body have to say, and indeed, of professional organisations outside the advisory body. they will continue to have a role to play in consultation and discussion which inevitably ought to take place. Nevertheless, there is this particular problem.

So we distinguish the position from the rule-making bodies for the Supreme Court and the county court and the matrimonial causes rules. We feel it is a situation much more equivalent to the Magistrates Courts Rule Committee which comprises the Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, and such others as the Lord Chancellor may determine, including a justices' clerk, one practising barrister and one practising solicitor. They advise the Lord Chancellor who makes the rules. There is an analogous provision in relation to the Land Registration Rule Committee. We shall look at the position.

As far as the deposit is concerned, I cannot give the undertaking which the hon. and learned Gentleman has requested. I think that this is a matter which has been very widely canvassed. There are differences of view. I recognise that: I could not have done otherwise. Not only

	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
have such views been expressed in this Committee, but there have been long and painful discussions about this matter with those whom my Department has consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we can re-open this policy matter. A decision has been taken. We have submitted it to the committee. It goes to the heart of what we are seeking to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be very unfair of me to try to mislead the hon Gentleman into thinking that I can and am prepared to reopen the matter. Nevertheless, subject to that, I am hopeful that the consultations that will take place in the future with a new advisory committee will be useful and will continually provide for an improve- ment in the bankruptcy rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister. I want to make three points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear that our choice of New Clause 6 was purely and simply to get something on the Amendment Paper. It is the simplest possible form of proposing such a committee. Assisted by the working party, my hon. Friend and I tabled it as a basis for discussion. It was not because we either knew of or were recognising the difficulties to which the Minister has referred. I am not sure the difficulty about receiving orders is the difficulty that he suggests, because I have an idea that there are officers of the court in connection with the duties that would be affected by the rules. Be that as it may, I would like to make it clear that we did not choose this, as distinct from a body with wider powers or wider functions, on a basis of sitting down and saving. " There are difficulties about making it more than this and so we would have this in preference to anything else we might have." We put it down just as a starting point for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the deposit. I suggest to the Minister that he is being rather obstinate about this. There have been many places in the Bill where on much more important matters than this he has not been obstinate. He has been reasonable—and by " reasonable " I mean that he has listened to the power of reason, and he has made very important changes in response. They have been much bigger than this—changes that affect people
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
to a much wider degree than this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a way out for everybody without any loss of face. There have been very big changes made in the Bill. I do not know whether they will add in total to the work of the Department or whether they will reduce it. I should have thought that, in total, they will reduce the work of the Department compared with what that workload would have been had the Bill gone through in its original form, because under the provisions of Clause 6 there would have had to have been a review in every case. Now there will be automatic discharges at the end of five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the finances had been worked out in advance and it was felt that by nutting up the limit to £300 that would reduce the load by X per cent. and that would amount to a saving of X hundred thousand pounds, but that was enough and therefore the deposit must be put up to £90, because only by doing that could one get the further reduction, and so on. I do not say that all those calculations have been undermined. but the basis on which those calculations were made no longer exists because substantial changes have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That decision was taken before there was consultation. I am not trying to rub salt in the wound. He has been good enough to accept what was said about lack of consultation at the beginning and has been good enough ever since to ensure that there was full consultation. The fact remains that on the £90—I am strictly on the point of the deposit here—that there was not the consultation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. and learned Gentleman considers the time in the Committee and the situation of the Bill. he will realise that it will make a substantial difference to whether we have another sitting or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, we are discussing a new clause which relates to whether there should be an Insolvency Rules Committee. I do not think that in order to argue that the hon. and learned Gentleman need go over arguments that we have had at great length on other clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of doing anything which might entail another sitting, and I do not think there will be any necessity for it. I think that what is

	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
left can be dealt with in a very few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister realises that there have been many changes in the situation since this decision was taken, and it would reflect very much to his credit if he said, "We will have another look at it in the light of all that has been said." I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

You have shown great patience, perseverence and even greater understanding of the provisions of the Bill than almost anybody else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like also to thank my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for the great assistance that he was able to offer and also relief from a certain 	<i>en nui</i>, as far as I was concerned, when it came to Clauses 8 and 9. I should like to thank the Government Whip, and also my hon. Friends who, with great reluctance, forbore from involving themselves too deeply in the debate, although it must have been tempting from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank the whole Comittee for the constructive way, on the whole, in which we have been able to conduct the debates on the Bill and the assistance that we have had from outside bodies. Finally, may I pay tribute to my own officials, who have had to assist me in conducting what has been a short but, nevertheless, technically difficult Bill through Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an uncontroversial Bill right from the beginning. Therefore, I am happy to join with the Under-Secretary in, first, expressing to you, Mr. English, our very deep thanks for the patience which you have shown and the great technical ability which you invariably display on these occasions in comprehending very complex matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also greatly appreciated Mrs. Jeger's participation. She also clearly understood what was going on, and for anyone to take part at that stage of the proceedings and do that was a considerable achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also express my thanks to the Minister, the Solicitor-General and the other hon. Members opposite?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also express my thanks to my hon. Friends, and particularly to my hon and learned Friend, the Minister for Southport (Mr. Percival), who has done so much work on this Bill. It has been a very heavy burden to carry and we are far from out of the wood yet: We have the Report stage to come, which will also be difficult and complex, and will require a lot of work between now and then. I should like particularly to express my thanks to him for having done a magnificent job in seeking to improve the Bill. I think that it is a much better Bill now than it was. It still has a curious lacuna in the first clause which we shall seek to put right on Report. Other than that, it is better, but it can be improved still further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Gentlemen. There was nothing in this Committee that occurred in other Committees after recent events, and I am grateful to hon. Gentlemen for the courteous way they have dealt with the Bill. It has had its difficulties, as the hon. Gentleman has said. I am rather surprised, though, that none of the hon. Gentleman on the Front Bench ever declared an interest. Members of Parliament are only one of two groups of people who cannot be imprisoned by their wives or the Revenue Department, so we all have an interest of a well-known technical kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
