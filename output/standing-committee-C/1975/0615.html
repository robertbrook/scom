EXTENSION OF POWER TO MAKE ADMINISTRATION ORDER</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed—[10th June]</i>—No. 64, in page 7, line 35, to leave out from the word "and" to the end of line 46 and insert the words—
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) it appears to the court that the person by whom the sum is payable('the debtor')is unable forthwith to pay the sum and also has other debts; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>) the court is of opinion that the case may be one in which the debtor's liabilities should he dealt with together under an order providing for the administration of his estate,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>the court may, with a view to making an administration order, order him to furnish to the court a list of all his creditors and the amounts which he owes to them respectively.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(1A)An order under subsection (1)above may be made by the court of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings there mentioned; and, subject lo rules of court, the court shall not make such an order of its own motion without giving the parties to those proceedings an opportunity of being heard"—<i>[Mr. Clinton Davis</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I direct the Committee's attention to a misprint on the Notice Paper. The text printed as "Amendment No. 67" is in fact the correct text for Amendment. No. 64, and that is the amendment with which we are dealing. I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are discussing the following amendments to the proposed amendment:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Amendment (a),in line 5, leave out from "an" to end of line 6 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"administration order as herein defined".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment (b),in line 7. leave out "an administration "and insert" such an".</p>
<p>Amendment (c),in line 9, leave out from "(1A)" to end of line 12 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Save at the request of the debtor, no order to furnish a list of his creditors shall be made under this section unless notice in the prescribed manner of an application to enforce a judgment (whether by the furnishing of a list of creditors or otherwise) has been made under this section unless notice in the prescribed manner of an application to enforce a judgment (whether by the furnishing of a list of creditors or otherwise) has been served upon the debtor not less than 10 clays before the making of an order to furnish a list as aforesaid".</p></blockquote></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
<p>We are also discussing Amendment No. 66, in page 7, line 46, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"but no such order shall be made unless the debtor has first been afforded full opportunity to oppose the making of such an order if he so wishes and to obtain legal representation on that issue if he so wishes".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Mr. Peter Archer)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. English, for reminding me of that. There are moments when my verbosity takes up and I am in danger of forgetting which amendment we are discussing.<br><br>
My disquisition on Thursday was brought to a halt when I was inviting the Committee to look at the differences between the original drafting of Clause 8 and the drafting as it would be introduced by Amendment No. 64. I pointed out that the new drafting was introduced to meet anxieties which had been expressed by hon. Members in the course of our deliberations, particularly the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival).<br><br>
It had not been spelled out in the original clause that the procedure proposed might be adopted on the application of any party. It was made clear that the court could make an order of its own
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
motion, but it was not intended to imply that the court could not entertain an application. If there were any doubt as to that, and there may have been, the intention of the amendment is to remove that doubt so that the court may make the order either to its own motion or on the application of any party.<br><br>
Finally, it has been pointed out that one would not expect the court to make an order without giving the parties concerned an opportunity to be heard. That certainty was not the intention, but it is perhaps better that the clause should be made explicit on that point and that is the purpose of the final words of subsection (lA).<br><br>
It may be said—I should say it if I were pressed—that these matters could have been dealt with under the county court rules. It is clear, in the wording of new Clause 7, if nowhere else, that it was intended that provision should be made to deal with this procedure. I agree with what the hon. and learned Member for Southport said, that if something is the intention and if there may be a doubt about it in the drafting, it is much better to resolve the doubt.<br><br>
You, Mr. English, reminded us that this amendment is being considered together with Amendment No. 66 and that there are sub-amendments on the Notice Paper. I shall not seek now to anticipate what might be said in support of them. At our last Sitting I ventured to make some general comments on the policy of the clause because without them it is difficult to discuss the amendment. It is a difficulty which you yourself have pointed out, Mr. English, that sometimes it is unfortunate that amendments have to be discussed prior to the questions that logically are prior to them because the debate on " clause stand part " comes last. I was grateful to the Chair for giving me that indulgence last time and I wonder whether I may crave a little further indulgence.<br><br>
I said two things last week in the interests of brevity which perhaps might be misleading and it would be helpful if I could be permitted to correct any false impression which might have been given. First, I spoke at one stage about the Law Society's Working Party on this subject only in the course of saying that I appreciated that the clause was not universally uncontroversial. My remark escalated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
because the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) quite properly insisted that my rather cavalier paraphrase of what the report said should be made explicit. But perhaps I should make it clear that the Working Party to which I was referring was a Joint Working Party of the Law Reform and Procedure Committee of the Bar and of the Law Reform Committee of the Council of the Law Society. I was concerned, principally, that it should not be thought that I had given insufficient weight to any representations originating from the Law Society. I imagine that it goes without saying that I was not likely to give insufficient weight to any representations emanating from the Bar Committee if only because I attend the meetings of that body.<br><br>
Secondly, in the course of a very attenuated explanation for lay members of the Committee as to what an administration order is, I said that it was a means of bringing together all the assets of the debtor together with all his debts. Perhaps I should make it clear that normally we are dealing with debtors who do not have many assets other than their future earning capacity. Normally what is being dealt with are future earnings. Therefore. I shall not attempt to anticipate what is said about the other amendments. My experience is that it does not really assist the Committee and does not save time by anticipating these arguments. It is probably better to allow the arguments to emerge in their logical sequence and comment on them at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that before the Solicitor-General sits down it would be helpful to the Committee if he could deal with two or three points. First, he has referred to the Law Society's Working Party, and I shall have something to say about that in a moment. Could he tell the Committee whether there were any consultations with anybody else—for example, the county court judges, the county court registrars or anybody else? If so, what views did they express?<br><br>
Secondly, did anybody write in and express any views about Clause 8 other than the Working Party? If so, what were their views?<br><br>
Thirdly, and this relates directly to the last point he mentioned, the Solicitor-General's explanation was perfectly explicit and not attenuated; in fact, it was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
very condensed. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"An administration order is a method of bringing together all the assets of a debtor so that, instead of each creditor taking a separate peck at the carcase, we can organise the debts, make sure that everyone gets a fair deal and organise the assets so that they are available to pay other debts '—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee C,</i> 10th June 1976; c.4041.</p></blockquote>
He has commented on that, but only very briefly. Is he saying that there is any power to get together the assets, and, if so, what? Is there any power to organise the assets, and, if so, what? Or is he now saying that it is only a power to deal with current income?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is quite properly proposing a power for a similar kind of procedural analysis to which I subjected something which he had previously said last week. As I said it, it is misleading. It might be more helpful if I hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman says on that aspect of the matter and comment on it later. However, he will not have failed to notice that the terms of the amendment itself now imposed upon the court at least an obligation to look at the assets of a debtor because it has to decide whether he is in a position to pay his debts forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How, and by what means has the court to do it'?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I do not want to be unhelpful about this. One knows what the difficulties are to which the hon. and learned Gentleman is adverting. Of course, the Payne Report had a method of dealing with this which at present is not available to us. 'But we are dealing with debtors whose normal assets consist in their future earnings. Basically, this is the purpose of the administration order, and this is what the court can do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the Solicitor-General, I think he is being unhelpful—particularly to those of us on the Committee, including yourself, Mr. English. who are lay Members. As I understand it, the statement that he made last week is not simply misleading, it is wrong. It is not the case that under an administration order there are powers to deal with the assets such as he suggested. However, if that is wrong and there are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
such powers, I think it would be helpful if the Solicitor-General sets it out at this point. I am sure the Committee would appreciate that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not want to be misleading and I do not want to be unhelpful. The powers are virtually to organise the future earnings. I accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None of the assets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None of the assets in the sense of existing property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a rather fundamental distinction in any terminology between income and assets. It is a distinction between a flow and a stock. The Solicitor-General was suggesting, previously, that there were powers to deal with assets, not income. There is a clear distinction between the two. Are we right in supposing that he was wrong previously, and in fact there are no powers to deal with assets? If there are powers to deal with assets, will he tell us what they are?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The powers under the order—I accept the hon. Gentleman's distinction between income and stock—are to deal with income. He is quite right. They are not to deal with the stock. In the course of the order, the court may allow execution to issue if it appears that the debtor has goods. I accept that that is probably what the hon. Gentleman has in mind, but would not be a power under the order. I accept that. But the court would not be precluded, as a I understand it, from permitting execution to issue against goods if it emerged that the debtor had goods.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is still looking puzzled. I am trying to get it right because I am trying to distinguish between the powers under the order itself. The powers under the order are powers to deal with future income. As I understand it, by the terms of the amendment the court would he required to advert to the assets of the debtor before making the order. n the course of the order, if it transpires that the debtor has goods, there is nothing to prevent the court permitting execution to levy against them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we are making
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1181">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 419</span>
some progress but the situation has now been clouded by the use of the word "goods". As I understand it, goods are assets, not income. But I come back to the point: is it or is it not the case that under the order, which is what we are talking about, there are no powers to deal with assets? If there are, will the Solicitor-General tell us what those powers are? Secondly, since he has rather confused the issue by the use of the word "goods", are there powers to deal with goods as distinct from other assets?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to do this without being too technical because normally when one is too technical one is criticised for that. I am not distinguishing between goods and assets in the sense to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. There are no powers under the order to deal with that, but it would be misleading if it were thought to follow from that, that because of the existence. of an order, the court has no power to allow execution to levy against them. Under the order, therefore, the hon. Gentleman is right in assuming that we are dealing with future income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to speak again, but I think we are now absolutely clear, and I am most grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for simply correcting the statement he made at our previous Sitting by saying that there is no power under the administration order to deal with assets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if the hon. Gentleman wants to put it that way, I am correcting the statement I made previously. But I hope it will be understood that r was trying to deal with this fairly briefly and not technically, which is how the issue arose.<br><br>
During the course of my remarks I have adverted to a number of difficulties which a Law Officer is under in attending a Committee of this kind. One difficulty is being accused of being unduly technical: another is coming to a Committee cold and not having heard the previous discussions; and a third—to which I had better confess before it becomes obvious—is that normally Law Officers are said to assist Committees because they have an expertise from which it may be possible to give the Committee assistance. I say
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
at once that in matters akin to insolvency law I have no such expertise. I do not know whether the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) has the advantage of me, but he will know that certainly at the Bar an expertise in this field of law is usually confined to a fairly narrow section of the Bar.<br><br>
I would not normaly seek to be dogmatic—in fact, I would be particularly reluctant to be dogmatic on this matter—but the purpose of these amendments is to meet anxieties which have been expressed.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Southport is, of course, entitled to say, if he so chooses subsequently, that he still does not like our pudding, although we have added ice cream to it to his own recipe. But I hope that, with his customary generosity, he will accept that having listened to the criticisms which have been made, we are trying to make a genuine attempt to meet them half way. Further than that, of course, I will hear what he has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that the Government are trying to do something that will be useful, which is what the argument on Clause 8 is about—whether it is of any use or not. There need not be anything very technical about it. The issue is not whether the Solicitor-General was talking in technicalities or non-technicalities. The question is whether he was right or whether he was wrong. What it amounted to—and I agree with him—is that he was wrong in two very important particulars last time. I am glad that he has taken the initiative and drawn attention to them, because I was going to have to do so.<br><br>
The two particulars in which the Solicitor-General was wrong are central to the argument, central to whether this remedy is of any use. So I am going to say a word more about them. But I hope that the Committee will not be led away from the real issues by his references to being brief and non-technical. Those things do not enter into it, the sole question is that of getting it right. He got it wrong and wish that he had just said so—instead of all that business about not being technical, and so on.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman knows that I would not say such things lightly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1182">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 421</span>
and I shall not say anything now, nor have I at ally stage in the Bill, which, in my view, I cannot support. There is no question of <i>amour propre</i> about this. The question is simply what is right and what is wrong, because it is on that basis alone that the Committee and then the House of Commons should decide whether or not to keep this clause.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to what he had said about the Law Society Working Party. I am glad that he has recognised that the way in which he put it was not very helpful to the Committee. I still think, that as it is left at the moment, it is misleading. I am glad that he cleared up the question of the composition of the Committee, because it is the fact that it is a joint working party drawn from two high-powered committees, one from each part of the profession, and the working party is, therefore, composed of experts in every part of this field. Though it is a narrow field, there are within it certain different expertises.<br><br>
It is important that that committee, coming from two parts of the profession and covering these various fields, is unanimous about what it has said. It should be of great weight as evidence of whether or not this clause has any practical use. Although I do not claim any expertise in this matter, perhaps, through force of certain circumstances, I do know a little more about it than a good many others, because I was, as the hon. and learned Gentleman was, on the Committee of the Administration of Justice Bill 1970, and I have now spent a long time on this Bill. Even so, my knowledge either of the law or of the practical effects of these provisions, is minute compared with the knowledge on both scores of those who make up this working party.<br><br>
What the Solicitor-General has still not told the Committee is the clearness and the strength of the views which have been expressed against this clause <i>in toto.</i> It will not do to say that the use of the phrase "have expressed some reservations" can be justified on grounds of brevity. The terms in which the working party has criticised the clause are of great relevance to the decision which this Committee has to make. The Solicitor-General might well have done what I am now about to do. Not everyone here may know—the Minister and I know—that that working party expressed a firm view
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
in writing on at least three occasions over a period of about six months, that view being that the clause was useless and should be omitted—not improved. Of course it says that if it cannot be omitted it must be improved—naturally it says that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Clinton Davis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is aware, I think, that this is not an unanimous view of those who have been primarily concerned in making recommendations to my Department, my officials and myself. Therefore, in fairness, that ought to be put in the proper context. There is a dissenting view from that put forward by the Law Society in its latest memorandum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of that. Is this a view said to be in writing? I know that, during the Whitsun Recess, the working party was called together to reconsider everything that had happened and to take stock of the position and express a view. I know that that view, in writing, was precisely the same as the view expressed on two earlier occasions over the period of six months—namely, that the clause was useless and should be omitted. Whether, at varying stages of the fragmented discussions, others have expressed slightly different views, I know not. But I know what that working party has seen fit to put on the record, and I know what its first, middle and final views wer—they were all the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way? One of the difficulties in a debate of this kind is remaining within the rules of order, Mr. English. I had anticipated that this report and the other documents to which the hon. and learned Gentleman refers would have been dealt with in the debate on "clause stand part". What I said about the working party was intended to be only one sentence in parenthesis. I am sure that, with his usual fairness, the hon. and learned Gentleman will appreciate that the normal part of our deliberations where we would join issue on these matters would have been on "clause stand part."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way when either the Solicitor-General or the Minister asks me to do so, but I hope that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1183">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 423</span>
they will contain themselves a little because, as the Solicitor-General himself said—and I quite agree—consideration of the clause itself is useful as a background to considering the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentlemen are certainly wasting time in the sense that they are discussing something which is a matter for me. But so far in the Committee, as the Solicitor-General may not be aware, the Committee has had an amicable agreement that that which it discusses on an amendment it does not discuss on "clause stand part". That being so, the rules of order, in this context, are that they are not being treated unjustly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear, Mr. English, that I was not taking any point from what the hon. and learned Gentleman was saying or trespassing on your domain to decide whether he was in order. I was defending myself against the charge that I had told less than the whole truth on the matter and I was explaining why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would have been far better if the Solictor-General had just told the Committee what the working party had said. Had he done so, we should not have had all this to-ing and fro-ing.<br><br>
In representations to the Lord Chancellor's Department at the end of December, the working party wrote about a page concerning clause 8. and ended by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are alarmed at the implications of Clause 8 and we recommend that the provisions should be omitted altogether from the Bill."</p></blockquote>
After the Bill had received its Second Reading, consultations at last took place, very belatedly.<br><br>
On March 12, the Working Party wrote to the Department about Clause 8 saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have given particular thought to this provision as we are acutely aware of the gap which the raising of the minimum debt…will leave in the means available for enforcing all but substantial debts. We have made inquiries among solicitors whose practices include much work of this kind, as a result of which we are yet more convinced that the extension of the administration procedure will not to any extent compensate."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 424</span>
It went on to give some reasons. I wish to refer to one, because it is very surprising to me that the Solicitor-General said what he did in column 4, to which I will come in a moment, despite the fact that this passage which I shall now quote had been raised specifically by the Working Party. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The procedure provides no effective means for investigating debtors' affairs, for which the court has no machinery in any case, nor does it provide any effective access to debtors' assets. Orders largely apply to debtors' income and do not touch capital. We see no grounds for believing that the new form of order will be any more effective "and the Committee concluded on Clause 8:"…we feel that Clause 8 should be omitted altogether."</p></blockquote>
Then, at Whitsun, the Working Party was convened and the chairman wrote to the Minister,
<br><blockquote><p>"As you know, there have been many discussions during the last few weeks between various individual members of the Working Party and individual members of your staff', with Mr. Harper and his staff and with the Lord Chancellor's Department. With the arrival of the parliamentary recession I thought it would be right to convene the Working Party so that they could review the whole position. We have just had a long meeting as a result of which we have prepared a Memorandum setting out our views on the outstanding questions. I enclose the memorandum."</p></blockquote>
It offered to meet if a meeting were decided upon.<br><br>
In that memorandum it says, on Clause 8:
<br><blockquote><p>"We see no advantage in including this clause in the Bill and we feel that it should be omitted. The profession's experience is that the administration order procedure is ineffective as a method of enforcing debts."</p></blockquote>
It is most important that the Committee and the House of Commons should know that, because I do not believe the Committee or the House would wish to introduce a procedure which will take up people's time, and perhaps build up people's hopes, when it is not an effective means of doing anything. That remains the view of the Working Party after all this time and after all these discussions.<br><br>
The memorandum continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The County Court is responsible for administration orders but it has no appropriate machinery which would make an administration order an effective procedure."</p></blockquote>
No more machinery is intended or promised.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal for extending the administration order procedure was originally put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1184">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 425</span>
forward by the Payne Committee but it was intended as an integral part of the system which would have included proper enforcement machinery. We can see no purpose in implementing one aspect of the Payne recommendations without the others. Clause 8 will, we think, prove valueless. It does not provide an effective remedy and should thus not be enacted."</p></blockquote>
That could not be clearer—either what the Working Party thinks or why it thinks it. After having engaged in discussions with the Lord Chancellor's department the Department of the Environment and anyone else who wished to enter into discussions, and after meeting and reconsidering the matter, it has come to the conclusion—in fact, it remains at the conclusion—that Clause 8 is useless and, therefore, that it should be omitted.<br><br>
I have taken a little time, Mr. English because I think it right that the Corn mittee should know those views which must be relevant to the question we have to decide.<br><br>
It is, of course, absolutely vital that, when we are discussing a procedure like this and before we start discussing amendments to what is proposed, we should have a mind's eye picture of what it is about which we are talking.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
On my recollection of what the Solicitor-General said at our last sitting and my reading of the report of his speech, I feel that his words gave a very inaccurate picture of what we are discussing. I am glad that he has to some extent put that right today. But it is still not clear enough.<br><br>
There is nothing technical about what I intend to say. There is no part of my comments that any layman would have difficulty in understanding. What we need to know is what happens if an order is made. What does the order say? How is it arrived at? What can the court do? Who does what? At the moment, we are in complete ignorance on these matters.<br><br>
Worse than that, the terminology so far used is very misleading. Let me invite the Solicitor-General's attention to the amendment which he is supporting. Clause 8(1)(<i>b</i>) would read,
<br><blockquote><p>"the Court is of the opinion that the case may be one in which all the debtor's liabilities should be dealt with together under an order providing for the administration of his estate".</p></blockquote>
That wording is taken from the 1959 Act, which talks about orders for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 426</span>
administration of a person's estate. In my mind, that conjures up a picture of someone administering someone else's effects, which means someone has power over the other's estate, not just power to take so much a week off him, because that is another matter altogether, but power to say "We shall do this with that land, we shall do this with that bank account, we shall do this with the business, and so on". That is the mind's eye picture that any layman has of someone administering someone's else's estate. An administration order here is nothing like that. n fact, there is no administration at all. It is a complete misnomer. Thc reason why this has developed is worth noticing.<br><br>
The Act of 1959 talked about an order "for the administration of the debtor's estate." It left everything else to be dealt with by rules. The rules that were made have produced a situation where there is no administration, as such, at all. There is just an instalment order for payment out of future income. Perhaps it is a salutory example of the points made before in this Committee that what is intended should be spelled out in the statute and not left for implementation in the rules.<br><br>
I have already read column 404 in which the Solicitor-General described an administration order in the terms there set out but it is not tedious repetition to read it again, and the Committee should try to keep this paragraph in mind. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"An administration order is a method of <i>bringing together all the assets of a debtor…."</i></p></blockquote>
If it was, it could be very useful. If there was a method open for the benefit of the judgment creditor, for instance, by which the court could bring together all the assets of the debtor, that will go a long way towards solving the problem. The paragraph continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"…so that, instead of each creditor taking a separate peck at the carcase, we can organise the debts, make sure that everyone gets a fair deal and <i>organise the assets</i>so that they are available to pay other debts."—<i>[official Reoport. Standing Committee</i>C; 10th June 1976, c.404.]</p></blockquote>
The first thing the Committee should know is that that is not the nature of administration orders at all. Administration orders, by nature, a remedy available to a debtor to enable him to obtain the protection of the court whilst, at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 427</span>
same time, some provision is made for sharing out what income there is among creditors.<br><br>
In Halsbury's Laws, the whole nature of the remedy is summed up in paragraph 577, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In order to enable debtors whose debts do not exceed £1,000, or such greater sum as may be specified by Order in Council, to obtain freedom from their liabilities while making just provision for their creditors, there is established a procedure under which a county court is authorised to make an administration order and to deal with matters incidental to it."</p></blockquote>
That is the nature of the beast which we are discussing. So far, the use of it has been extended once, and that was under the attachment of earnings orders pro- cedures. There, the court has power of its own motion to make such an order. I said at our last sitting that I was unable to find any evidence that that power had been used even once. The schedule of statistics suggests that all the orders that have been made have been made on application. There is no pattern to indicate that such an order has been made by a court of its own motion. I have spoken to numerous county court judges, and I am unable to find any case where any judge is aware of the powers having been used. I have asked for the statistics, and perhaps we shall be given them later.<br><br>
It is, first, part of my proposition that an administration order is not at all what it was described to be at Column 404. What, then, is it? The simplest way to find out is to refer to an administration order, because the form in which the order is to be made is prescribed by rule in the Administration Order Rules in Form 5.<br><br>
When referring to a document, I believe the practice is that I must place a copy of it before the Committee, which I now do. I have a dozen copies available if any Member wishes to look at the document. I do not know whether the Solicitor-General has ever seen the form of order. I rather doubt jt from what he said earlier, but perhaps he would like to see a photostat of the form in which an administration order must be made. The effect of the order must of course he limited to the words used by the court in making the order. This is what the order says:
<br><blockquote><p>"IT IS ORDERED that the above-named debtor do pay the debts in the schedule to this order, and all other debts now clue and after
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
wants proved under this order, in full[or to the extent of pence in the pound], by instalments of£for every month until this order is complied with."</p></blockquote>
That is all the order is. There is nothing about administration, and no powers to anybody to administer anything.<br><br>
I looked through the rules—and perhaps the Solicitor-General will deal with this matter when he comes to reply—to find what powers anybody has to do anything about it or to do anything consequent upon it. I find that if the debtor does not keep up the instalments, the order may be rescinded, and various provisions like that, and of course it would be astonishing if there were not.<br><br>
Then I looked round to see what powers of enforcement there were, and I suggest to the Solicitor-General that such powers of enforcement as exist are at present negligible. He referred to the Payne Report, which is a useful starting point. It is a pity that he did not draw the attention of the Committee to one or two more paragraphs of it. The Payne Committee dealt with the question of enforcement and administration orders in some detail and, at paragraph 755 of its report, spoke particularly of the enforcement of an administration order, in these terms:
<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the registrar that the debtor has property which exceeds in value£10 he may be required by a creditor to issue execution, but the sanction primarily intended for the compliance with an administration order is the judgment summons."</p></blockquote>
There lies one of the most significant points in the whole argument. Until we abolished imprisonment for debt, the judgment summons was, as is well known by all solicitors and is well demonstrated by all the civil judiciary statistics, a very powerful means of enforcing an order for payment. What used to happen was that, if a debtor failed to make the instalments payable under the administration order, the registrar issued a judgment summons; and if the judgment debtor did not pay, as required by the judgment summons, lie went to prison. In this case, as with other civil debts, that was a very effective method of enforcement.<br><br>
I do not know whether the Solicitor-General has had the opportunity of reading our earlier discussions, but I think we are all now totally convinced that, when we abolished the power to imprison debtors, we destroyed totally the value of the judgment summons as a means for recovering money, except in the case of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1186">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 429</span>
Government Departments, such as the Inland Revenue which, if it issues a judgment summons for arrears of tax, can pursue the matter right up to and including an order for imprisonment. Therefore, the one means of enforcement which made the order of some real value at a time when the Payne Committee was reporting has gone.<br><br>
There is a reference there to execution if the debtor has property in excess of£10. But that is a remedy that is available to any judgment creditor, anyway. I do not think that I need repeat what has been referred to before, namely, the view held by the practitioners that execution on goods in the county court has become practically useless. So far as this has any value, it is, of course, limited to goods, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing(Mr. Higgins)pointed out, the most valuable asset may not be goods.<br><br>
I hope, Mr. English, that this short explanation—all in non-technical terms—will give the Committee a rather more accurate mind's eye picture of what happens when an administration order is made. The debtor puts in a list of his creditors and a list of his income. An order for instalments is then made—and that is all the order amounts to—and the means of execution of enforcement are as tiny as I have just outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am now having some difficulty in seeing any reference even to goods in the copy of the administration order which my hon. and learned Friend has for the Committee's convenience circulated. Therefore, I am not clear—although doubtless we can be told later—where that comes into the order at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is derived from the administration order rules. There is a rule which says that where there are goods in excess of£10—that is, an excess of£10 after making allowances for certain household items, tools and so on—the registrar if so required by a creditor, shall issue a warrant of execution. I do not know whether I saw someone shake his head in disagreement, but, if that is wrong, I hope that I shall be told now. However, I do not think that I am wrong, unless it is that it comes from the Act of 1959. The effect of it, as I think all will agree, is that, if there are goods in excess of£10 after certain disregards for personal belongings, tools of trade and so on, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
registrar shall on the application of a creditor issue a warrant for execution. Of course, he has no special privileges, and there is no reason to believe that the fact of execution will be any more effective than execution levied direct by a judgment creditor.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
One now begins to see the background to this, and one is able to ask "What is the use of making an order of the kind referred to in Amendment No. 64?", because it is under the amendment that any order which might be made in the future would be made. As I understand the position, the effect of making such an amendment would be precisely what I have said. Even a layman, therefore, can readily realise why the experts are saying "But it is useless. Don't bother yourselves. What is the use. It will only produce more work".<br><br>
It is a fact even worse than that, because there are other difficulties to which neither the Minister nor the Solicitor-General has referred. They are difficulties directly related to the question of whether the court should be allowed to make an order of its own motion. When an administration order is made, it effectively prevents judgment creditors from pursuing any other remedy. One can imagine the effect of that upon the credit of a small businessman. We are here considering particularly the self-employed, and the case advanced by the Lord Chancelor's Department is that this is necessary because creditors have so little remedy against the self-employed. That is right, but it does not make their position any better by introducing a useless remedy.<br><br>
Let us consider the position of a person who is self-employed, who runs a small business and who, therefore, may very properly run on credit most of the time or may have outstanding credits all the time. He relies for the running of his business on the confidence of creditors. If an administration order is made, the creditors then know that if they become judgment creditors their right to enforce a claim will be denied to them, because the administration order will have superseded all other rights. The Committee should know that the Payne Committee thought this was an important consideration in deciding whether or not it should recommend that a court should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1187">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 431</span>
have power of its own motion to make an administration order.<br><br>
I shall give one or two references in the Payne Report which the Committee may wish to pursue. The Payne Committee expressed the hope that more use would be made of administration orders in the future. But, as the Committee made perfectly clear, it formed that hope because it intended that very substantial new powers of enforcement should be introduced. One thing that it did not contemplate was the removal of one of the existing powers of enforcement, namely, the availability of the judgment summons without the introduction of any new means of enforcement.<br><br>
On that premise, the Payne Committee then considered and reported in considerable detail on who should be entitled to apply for an administration order and whether the court should be entitled to make such an order of its own motion. At that time, only the debtor could apply for an administration order, and the Payne Committee gave reasons for saying that not only should the debtor be entitled to apply but so should the judgment creditor. Therefore, it was a matter of great surprise to us when we found that Clause 8 contained no power to the judgment creditor to apply.<br><br>
I do not accept the Solicitor-General's explanation that that could be dealt with by the rules. I doubt whether it could. It is a substantive right, not a mistake of procedure. Rules deal with procedure, not substantive rights. The right to apply is one to be given by statute. But I think that he might agree with me in any event that, if that is intended, it would he much better to put it into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have done that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but very late in the day and after a lot of prodding, pushing and prompting. But at last it got there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may perhaps save time if we clear up some of these matters as we proceed. Is the hon. and learned Gentleman saying that, where the court has power to do anything of its own motion, it would not be possible for someone to ask the court to do it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am saying that.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
It would be possible to ask. There would be nothing to stop anyone from asking. But if one is talking of right, the question is whether a judgment creditor has a right to apply for a certain order—[<i>Interruption.</i>]I wish the Solicitor-General, instead of constantly interrupting, would listen to the whole of the proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am hardly "constantly interrupting".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) please continue with his argument and let the acrimony about who is interrupting whom be forgotten?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to get on with my argument. I am trying to put it into non-technical terms sufficiently for it to be understood. I am merely now responding to an intervention from the Solicitor-General. I say that, if a person is to have a right in law to apply for an order—a right to which the court must have regard and not simply may consider—then that right must be given by statute and not by rules.<br><br>
On whether the court should have the power to make an administration order of its own motion, the Payne Committee says, at paragraph 782:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have given careful consideration to the question whether the Enforcement Office or the court should be enabled to make an administration order without the concurrence of the debtor or the judgment creditors. When the debtor wishes to have the order, no difficulty arises, but there may well be cases—</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Ministers will listen to this and give their views to the Committee—
<br><blockquote><p>"which would qualify for an order under the terms which we have suggested but in which judgment creditors would be willing to give the debtor an opportunity lo continue his business without the burden of an administration order and to pull his affairs round. On the other hand the interests of non-judgment creditors may conflict with the interests of the debtor or the judgment creditors and it may well be in the public interest that a multiple debtor should be brought under the restraint inherent in an administration order and prevented or deterred from further hazardous dealings or rash indebtedness. The Enforcement Office, if empowered so to do, could watch and protect the public interest and the interests of non-judgment creditors…."</p></blockquote>
The operative words there are
<br><blockquote><p>"if empowered so to do".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1188">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
The paragraph goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"After giving this important problem due consideration we have reached the conclusion that the county court judge, on a report from the Enforcement Officer and on notice to the debtor and the judgment creditors, giving them an opportunity to oppose the order, should have jurisdiction to make such an order."</p></blockquote>
That is the position to which the amendment will bring us. The court, it is now provided specifically could only do it after giving the judgment creditor and debtor the right to be heard but it could then make an order even if neither of them concurred or if they both opposed it.<br><br>
But what I should like to point out to the Minister is this: in making that recommendation, which it did only after considerable thought in its Report, the Payne Committee did so on the assumptions that there would be an enforcement officer with all the powers that it intended that officer and office to have, that there would be before the court a report from that officer, and that the making of the order would be backed up by all those powers.<br><br>
Let me give two other paragraph numbers study of which would make what I have just said perfectly clear. They are paragraphs 800 and 314(b). Perhaps the latter makes clearest in the shortest space what enforcement provisions the Payne Committee anticipated being available to the enforcement officer. It said this:
<br><blockquote><p>"The process for the enforcement of judgment debts should be capable of reaching out to all the income, assets and property of the judgment debtor subject to specified exceptions."</p></blockquote>
So the Payne Committee viewed with some hesitation, and had some considerable hesitation about, recommending that the court should be entitled of its own motion to make an order. It did so only on the basis set out in those paragraphs. It is clear that its assumptions that an administration order would be of some value and recommendation that the court should have power to make such an order of its own motion were based on the assumption that new and very much more comprehensive powers of enforcement would be introduced and would therefore be available to the enforcement officer to enable him to give effect to the administration order.<br><br>
None of that has happened. There is no suggestion that it will happen. It would be a major change in the whole system to introduce those new factors. But, unless
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
one does so, all the recommendations of the Payne Committee about administrations of the Payne Committee about administration orders fall to the ground. Worse that that, we have implemented that part of the Payne Committee's recommendations which in effect, has abolished certain useful remedies, namely, the judgment summons.<br><br>
If we had not done that, there might even have been some sense in extending the application of administration orders, as the amendment does. But we have done that, which has made them even less useful than than they were before and we have not done any of the things which the Payne Committee recommended which would have given more teeth to these processes and made them useful.<br><br>
I am assuming, now, Mr. English, that Clause 8 is accepted and I am dealing with the specific question of whether the court should have power to make an order of its own motion.<br><br>
I would draw the Committee's attention to the one existing power of the court to make such an order of its own motion, now it is in Section 4 of the Attachment of Earnings Order 1971, but it was introduced in the Administration of Justice Act 1970. I looked up the Committee Stage proceedings relating to when that provision was introduced. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Sir P. Rawlinson) and I both said that we were bemused by what was being done and as to what was intended; and in addition I asked exactly the questions that I have been asking now. Why is it thought that to give the court the power to make such an order of its own motion will lead to an increase in the number of orders? Secondly, if it does lead to such an increase, what about the additional burden on the county court? I dealt with that matter in column 167 of the Committee Stage of that measure.<br><br>
I should like to read the reply of the then Attorney-General, because there is an echo now of what was being said then. The then Attorney-General said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think it is the case that some registries have made considerable use of administration orders, whereas there has been a good deal of reluctance, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has indicated, in other registries to use this valuable machinery. But I think that the proposal in the Bill to provide for a more efficient administration machinery will result in a greater use of administration orders."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1189">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 435</span>
Not only is there nothing to support that expectation now, but the figures I have already given to the Committee show the opposite. Use of these orders has declined over the last four years, despite the fact that the limits of jurisdiction have been increased.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"We certainly attach importance to the extension of the use of administration orders, related as they will be in many cases to attachment of earning orders. The person appointed to have the conduct of an administration order does not have to administer the whole pf the debtor's affairs; in effect he simply sees that payments are made in accordance with the provisions of the administration order. He will then have the duty of distributing them among the creditors <i>pro rata,</i> and take steps to enforce the order where necessary.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I understand that in the past this was an important reason for the limited use of administration orders; the initiative has had to come from the debtor, whereas under the provisions of the Bill the court will have power to make an administration order of its own motion. That is obviously an important innovation, which will improve matters considerably. It is as part of that process that the Amendments that we are discussing con-tribute."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i>G, 7th April 1970; cols. 167–8.]</p></blockquote>
That was accepted by us all as an act of faith. The debate on it was very short. We just hoped at that time that what the Attorney-General said would prove to be right.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
However, on this occasion when we are considering extending it with the complications and difficulties which that will introduce…</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. and learned Friend sits down, can he tell me whether it is right that the necessary powers to convey upon the court to give it the right to administer an estate in the proper sense of the word "administration," could be done by order—that it would not require any further statute? Are we to take it that all that is required is an order to convey upon the county court judge the same powers of administering estate as has the Chancery Judge?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. and learned Friend is right about this. The wording of the 1959 Act and the wording of the amendment, which refers to powers to make an order for the administration of the estate, leads one to think on read-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
ing therein that what is being done is exactly what my hon. and learned Friend has just said, that under these provisions powers are being bestowed upon the county court to make an order similar in consequence and powers of enforcement and so on to those in the Chancery Division to which he has just referred. It is a nasty surprise when one gets to the rules to find that it is not that kind of order at all. He is right, and it could be done that way, but I do not think for a moment that the Lord Chancellor's Department or the Government want to do that because, being an effective order, it would need an effective means of carrying it out—which would mean extra staff and extra money. This Bill is supposed to cut down on those items.<br><br>
The view of those who really understand these matters is that the clause is useless—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says "Not true", but I merely read out what was stated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And I shall of course deal with that point when the hon. and learned Gentleman sits down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. But if the Minister has received any communication since 3rd June, perhaps he had better say so now, because the last thing in the world I want to do is to say anything incorrect. I have merely read out the views expressed in writing by the joint working party—not snatches said here and there in various meetings—which is that they think the clause should be omitted because it is useless. I hope I have said sufficient to indicate to the Committee what is in fact the nature of this remedy and the way it works out because, as soon as one knows that, one can see why they say it is useless. They say that in practice it has proved to be useless. It is easy to see why.<br><br>
I say a word or two now on points of detail arising on the amendment. I do not suppose that either the Minister or the Solicitor-General would suggest that this should be the final wording. It introduces significant differences which are intended to meet the points of detail raised by myself and others. Even if the clause remains, we should try to see what im-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1190">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
provements might be made to it, so that it can be improved by Report Stage.<br><br>
The Solicitor-General says that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"unable forthwith to pay the sum"</p></blockquote>
are introduced to make the court look at the capital assets. But is that their effect? There are many people with lots of assets who could not pay a particular debt forthwith due to their assets being tied up in property, or whatever, and their not having liquid cash. The phrase means simply that the person cannot get his hands on cash to pay the sum outstanding. He may be nowhere near insolvent but still cannot meet the requirement. It is not a good test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fletcher-Cooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is exactly like the United Kingdom at present—it has plenty of assets but it cannot pay its debts forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. So I should be glad if the Minister would say a word about that.<br><br>
Next, our Amendment (a) would substitute for the words
<br><blockquote><p>"the administration of his estate"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. and learned Gentleman keep his voice up? We actually want to hear him!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry there had to be that little snide remark at the end, but I am glad to be told that the Solicitor-General—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was not intended to be snide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a remarkable imitation of sidedness.<br><br>
Amendment (a) would substitute for the words
<br><blockquote><p>"the administration of his estate"</p></blockquote>
the words
<br><blockquote><p>"an administration order as herein defined".</p></blockquote>
The entirely non-technical reason for it is that we believe the words
<br><blockquote><p>"an order for the administration of his estate"</p></blockquote>
are an abuse of language. It is not an order for the administration of an estate. It is an order as defined in the administration order procedure and rules. The amendment would make no difference in substance, but it seems to us that some-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
thing which uses words that are apt, instead of words that are an abuse of language, is much to be desired.<br><br>
Amendment (b), a consequential amendment in line 7, would be necessary if Amendment (a) were to be made.<br><br>
I come now to the new subsection (1A) in Amendment No. 64. It says
<br><blockquote><p>"—subject to rules of court, the court shall not make an order of its own motion without giving the parties to those proceedings an opportunity of being heard."</p></blockquote>
That raises the suggestion that someone has in mind that rules of court will he made the result of which will be that the court may make an order of its own motion without giving the parties to the proceedings an opportunity of being heard. If that is not what it means, I do not know what it does mean. And if that is what it means, it ought not to be there. It would indicate our intention to give powers to the Rules Committee, whatever it is going to be, to make rules which would in fact, result in the permitting of something which appears to be precluded under subsection (1A). Therefore. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about that.<br><br>
Finally, on subsection (IA) I should like to say something about Amendment (c) to Amendment No. 64. The purpose and effect of it is quite clear. The words
<br><blockquote><p>"Save at the request of the debtor"</p></blockquote>
recognise that at the time when judgment is given, there and then the debtor might ask that an order for a list of creditors be made, and such and order would be deemed to be an act of bankruptcy, which is subsection (4). We would not object to subsection (4) in those circumstances because the deemed act of bankruptcy would have occurred as the result of an application by the debtor himself. That is all right.<br><br>
However, as to the remainder of Amendment (c) the objective of it is to ensure, and such objective would bc achieved by it, that if a judgment creditor wants to apply for an order for a list of creditors to be made as a step in the enforcement of his judgment, he may do so. But no such order shall be made unless the debtor has been served with notice of it and such notice has been given to him not less than 10 days before the making of the order. This seems to us to be necessary both in order to do what is fair, and also to meet the dif-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1191">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
ficulties we have previously experienced about subsection (4). It is only fair that a debtor should have a chance to be heard before such an order was made, and that is recognised in Amendment No. 64. That is, in principle, little more than a different way of doing it. I suggest that it is a better way of doing it. But it does have this difference—it cuts out the power of the court to make an order of its own motion.<br><br>
I hope the Ministers will look this matter squarely in the eye. Is it intended that if the court has before it both the judgment creditor and the judgment debtor and both are saying "No. Please do not make an administration order", nevertheless, the court may make that order against the wishes of both? Is that what is intended? If it is, why? If the justification is that the Payne Committee recommended it, what about the other things that is recommended as part of the package? If that power is to be given to the county court to act not only of its own motion, but directly contrary to the wishes of both parties before it, who else is to be consulted and considered before the order is made?<br><br>
Those are not the only two parties affected by it. The other parties affected by the making of an administration order are the other judgment creditors. And not only the other judgment creditors but also the other non-judgment creditors and potential creditors, because they then are put in a different position from what they would otherwise be in if such an order does not exist. How are their rights to be considered?<br><br>
I am now postulating that the Government intend that the court shall have such a power when it has both judgment creditor and debtor before it. They are both saying "No. Please do not make an order. We do not want you to make an order", nevertheless, the court says "We are going to make an order". Is that what the Government intends? If so, how do they justify that in the first place? And even if they can justify it, how do they propose that interests of other creditors, both judgment and non-judgment, shall be catered for?<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
If Mr. Solicitor and the Minister will let us have the benefit of their views on those matters, we may be able to form
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
some sort of view as to what is the right sort of package. It is clear from what I have been saying that I think that if Clause 8 remains it must be improved. The main changes imported by Amendment No. 64 are improvements. But I do not regard it as being in the final form in which we should like to see it, nor do I think that we can arrive at firm conclusions about the form at this stage. However, it will help us a great deal to form a conclusion about them before Report if the Ministers will address their minds to it either now or later if they feel questions have been raised that need more time for consideration—that is a proposition I can entirely understand. I would much rather have someone say "I would like to think about that again". I do not regard that as a sign of weakness. If there are such points, let one of the Ministers say so and tell us their considered view later. Therefore, I hope now that the Ministers will be able to give us as much information or as much indication of their thinking as is possible on those points now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I intervened, briefly, to deal with one point that was raised by the hon. and learned Gentleman, not so much on the merits of Clause 8—or demerits as he would put it—but on the isolated issue of consultation. I suggest that he is mistaken in asserting that—and I quote his own words—"those who never doubt these things find that the provisions are useless and that this is a unanimous view."<br><br>
He also raised in the context of his arguments the inadequacy of consultation with professional bodies about Clause 8. I think he also raised the question of consultation with those responsible for the administration of the courts in so far as the operation of Clause 8 was concerned. I think it right that I should put on record the position as we on the Government side see it. It is not identical to that presented to the Committee by the hon. and learned Gentleman. One has to see what has happened in the context of the unfolding of the story in relation to Clause 8 in particular, which went on over a period of years.<br><br>
It started with the previous Administration. I am not privy to precisely what happened in the discussions that took place between Ministers at that time,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1192">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
but I do know that concern was being expressed, I believe in the House and certainly by some Members of Parliament, about the need to strengthen remedies against self-employed debtors. I do not think the hon. and learned Gentleman would dissent from that proposition. Indeed, that was inherent in the Payne Report. It was never suggested in the Payne Report that it be introduced all in one lump. It was a gradual process that would evolve, and I want to intervene, so to speak, in my own remarks in order to say that—although if necessary my hon. and learned Friend will be able to embark further upon that argument.<br><br>
We then had Justice itself presenting a view which is set out in paragraph 40 of its report of 1975, where it was stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee is, however, conscious of the possibility, open at least to the debtor whose affairs fall within a small compass, of employing the procedure contained in the Administration of Justice Act 1970, known as "the Administration Order".</p></blockquote>
It then goes on to speak of the procedure in the United States, but it concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"We think that the power which already exists to extend by Order in Council the scope of the administration order procedure should be exercised more frequently".</p></blockquote>
That was an initial view of Justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say whether that was in the context of the overall pay proposals, that is, with provisions for enforcement, or whether it was merely on its own?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: of course, the Justice proposals have to be seen, in fairness to Justice, as a totality, but it was an expressed view. I am not asserting that it was a dogmatic view, asserted in isolation of all other matters, I am merely saying that this was one of the features which unfolded in relation to how Clause 8 came to be put before the Committee.<br><br>
In all the circumstances, we considered, not without justification, that the implementation of the concept would not meet with hostility or even arouse deep interest. After publication of the Bill on 13th January 1976, the working group of the Bar Council and the Law Society submitted its memorandum on the Bill. Two days later, there was Second Reading in another place. Thereafter, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, there was con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
siderable discussion between my officials and the working group and Justice—I could rehearse all the facts concerned—and these discussions continued till 20th May, and when the hon. and learned Gentleman asserts that a unanimous view was being expressed, I think he is mistaken.<br><br>
I myself met its representatives of Justice on 23rd March. Those present on behalf of Justice were Mr. Allan Heyman Q.C., Professor R. M. Goode and Mr. Briggs and we met to discuss the Bill and their anxieties about it. My recollection, which is corroborated by my Department's records, is that no hostility was asserted to the principle of Clause 8. There was not that deep hostility to which the hon. and learned Gentleman consistently alluded. Indeed, various suggestions were made for improving the operation of Clause 8 and there are now embodied in what the Government have put to the Committee in the shape of amendments. Therefore, the hon. and learned Gentleman is worng about that, and I think it right that the record should be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The lion. Gentleman must know that I was quoting the working party—not Justice. Let him add to what I have said, but let him not suggest that it was inaccurate. I was quoting the working party's views, as expressed in writing at various stages—no more, no less.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to those who know about these things and the representatives of Justice also know about these things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>—<i>indicated dissent</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman cannot simply shake his head. The people who attended that meeting are skilled in these matters. They must have becn alerted to the issues at stake because we invited them to discuss with us their anxieties about the Bill. The hon. and learned Gentleman is not suggesting that Justice accords with his point of view when he says that Clause 8 is utterly useless, as that clearly was not the impression conveyed at that meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us what views were expressed, if any?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1193">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see that the hon. and learned Gentleman is getting a little bad-tempered because he has been caught out. He has asserted a mistaken view. What, in fact, has happened is that Justice has not taken a view which accords with that of the hon. and learned Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Is it right to make such personal suggestions? I have asked a perfectly simple question. I do not want to hear of impressions, I want to know what views were expressed. If I have—and we shall see on the record what I have said—purported to give a view expressed by someone else and given it wrongly, I shall be the first to apologise to the Committee. But I think it would help the Committee if the Minister were to tell us what views were expressed by these various parties and then we can check. We cannot check impressions but we can check expressions of view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not necessarily regard remarks about irritability or bad temper as being out of order, nor are they a matter for judgment of the Chair. What I do suggest to both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. and learned Gentleman is that in Committee there is far less need to interrupt speeches, as members can speak as often as they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I said was the view of Justice at the meeting on 23rd March was not consistent with the view that has been expressed by the hon. and learned Gentleman. He attributes certain views to those who know about these matters, and says that those who know about these matters consider the clause useless. That is the whole burden of what he was saying.<br><br>
In refutation of that, I say merely that it is not the unanimous view of those who know about these matters. Those representatives who came to see me from Justice are as entitled to express their point of view as those others whom the hon. and learned Gentleman chose to cite. Of course it is not merely a question of impression; it is a question of the Justice representatives putting forward views which would improve the position, and those views are embodied in the amendments which we are presenting for the approval of the Committee. I think
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
that I am entitled to put that point of view as forcefully as the hon. and learned Gentleman put his, and to correct the record—at least in part.<br><br>
The consultation that took place with judges and registrars was another matter to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred in a previous sitting. The draft Bill was in fact proposed in June 1975. n that month, consultations took place with the Chief Bankruptcy Registrar, the President of the Association of County Court and District Registrars, and, I gather, with two or three individual county court registrars. There was no reason from the point of view of the Lord Chancellor's Department, to believe that there would be any undue strain on the courts as a result of the operation of Clause 8—I believe this was the point made by the hon. and learned Gentleman—because the load following the implementation of these provisions would be spread evenly, and, in any event, to some extent, loss of bankruptcy work would compensate for it.<br><br>
The fact remains that there were no representations, as I understand it from the judges or the Association of County Court and District Registrars expressing any concern about a serious addition workload. nevitably, representations would have been made had they felt any deep concern about such a workload arising.<br><br>
I think it right that I should put these points on the record, but I do not want to delay the Committee.</span></p>
<p>12.0 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are we to understand that the only question and point in these consultations is whether they were worried about the workload? Presumably other questions were asked of them as they have to administer it. Were they or were they not in favour of the proposals in the Bill without any corresponding enforcement provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think judges and registrars become involved in what might be political, or quasi-political matters. I have no evidence before me to suggest that any anxiety was expressed by the organisation or by those who were consulted about the efficacy of the proposals that were to be put forward. I do not say that they approved of them. What I am saying is that I have no reason for saying that they disapproved
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
of them and I have no evidence whatsoever in the matter. If there had been any grave doubts about the operation of these matters, those doubts would also have been advanced.<br><br>
I think it is right that I should have put these matters on record. I am now advised that the registrars were asked whether they were in favour of the proposals and they indicated that they were. That is the information forthcoming from the Lord Chancellor's Department.<br><br>
I have presented this in parentheses to the main issues of the debate because, at our last sitting, Ministers, were invited by the hon. Gentleman to comment on these matters which were rightly considered to be of some consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful for the Minister to have intervened at that point and to have told us what further consultations have taken place.<br><br>
I am still unclear, as was the Minister, about the scope of consultations which took place with the judges, registrars and others. The Under-Secretary has told us that they were in favour of the proposals but it is still not clear whether they were, even though there were apparently no effective enforcement provisions which would be covered. Perhaps if he could expand a little on that, it would help the Committee.<br><br>
I want to take up the other point the Minister has just made as to what is the view of those who have made representations on this subject. He told us the views of Justice when he last met its representatives. He has not told us what the views of Justice are currently. It is the case that views have changed to some extent in the course of our proceedings.<br><br>
The position of the Joint Working Party of the Law Reform Procedure Committee of the Bar and the Law Reform Committee of the Council of the Law Society is, as became apparent at our last sitting, abundantly clear. Despite the way in which the Solicitor-General originally presented it, it became apparent, in response to my intervention, that its view is
<br><blockquote><p>"We see no advantage in including this clause in the Bill and we feel that it should be omitted".</p></blockquote>
They could not be clearer than that. We must give considerable weight to the view which they expressed.<br><br>
My own feeling is not simply that this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
clause is useless. If that were the case, there would still be a strong argument for omitting it. It is not good procedure to write into law clauses which are useless. But I think there are considerable arguments in favour of the view that this clause is worse than useless because it is not only ineffective, it also has certain features, particularly as to whether it creates a new act of bankruptcy as a result of providing list of creditors, which are positively objectionable.<br><br>
I do not want to stray on to the " clause stand part " debate, Mr. English, but on the main point the simple matter at issue here is that the clause ought to be omitted. None the less, at this stage we are discussing amendments, and the question is whether the amendments which the Government have put forward, and our amendments to their amendment, ought or ought not to be accepted.<br><br>
What strikes me here are the problems we faced in the exposition of the Solicitor-General. As a result of this morning's sitting, we are a great deal clearer about the position than we were earlier. But I am genuinely worried about the way in which the Solicitor-General has presented this matter, because at our last sitting, in a number of passages he made specific reference, saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"An administration order is a method of bringing together all the assets of the debtor so that, instead of each creditor taking a separate peck of the carcase we can organise the debts, make sure that everyone gets a fair deal and organise the assets so that they are available to pay other debtsi That is the purpose of an administration order.…".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i> C, 10th June 1976, c.404.]</p></blockquote>
We have established that that statement was simply untrue. It is not the position that an administration order does that.<br><br>
Therefore, while we accept what the Solicitor-General says, namely, that he is not an expert in this particular field, which is, after all, a very specialised area, none the less the purpose of the Law Officers attending Committees is that they should give us the benefit of their expert advice. It may not be their personal advice, but it is the advice that their experts have given to them, so that they, in turn, can advise the Committee<br><br>
Therefore, it raises the question, when the Solicitor-General spoke the words I have just quoted, were they his own inexpert views or were they the official advice that he received? That was the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1195">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
advice he was supposed to be giving and if that was the case, it is disgraceful. Although it is true that officials cannot defend themselves in Committees, it is also the case that the Back Benchers in the Committee—indeed, the Front Benchers also—have some difficulty in defending themselves against bad advice of that sort.<br><br>
I put that on record because I feel very strongly about it and I think it is extremely unfortunate. But that having been said, I want to appeal to the Solicitor-General and to the Under-Secretary to look at this matter with an open mind. We genuinely believe we have no axe to grind on these matters. We genuinely believe that the case against the clause and the points on the amendments are such that it ought to be omitted.<br><br>
In connection with the amendment, I wish to refer to another passage which the Solicitor-General said, at col. 410. He was referring to the four major differences which this amendment makes to the Bill. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"First, some doubts were expressed about whether the court should have…regard to the assets of the debtor before it made an prder. The revised text includes the words:'is unable forthwith to pay', which necessarily brings in his assets".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee</i>C, 10th June 1976, c.410.]</p></blockquote>
That is a lot of nonsense. The addition of the words "is unable forthwith to pay" does not bring in the assets. It might conceivably bring in the question of the liquid assets. That is the point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) in regard to the position of the United Kingdom. It might bring in the liquid assets, but it certainly does not bring in the assets as such. Therefore, the Government's amendment does not appear to cover that point.<br><br>
We come next to the question of whether the procedure is effective. The Under-Secretary read out a passage from the Justice report which apparently he hoped would support his case in favour of this clause and the amendment under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I was trying to do—I apologise if I did not make myself clear—was to set the background against which this clause was born. It was not to put forward the proposition
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
that Justice actually support wholly the concept that we have put forward. It may have reservations about that, and I have been frank with the Committee about the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused now. The Under-Secretary says that Justice, as against the Working Party, has reservations. I had understood him to say earlier that it was in favour of this procedure. This is the essence of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton-Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But what I was saying is that it put forward proposals to improve the position as it saw it presented at that time. Its recommendations are now embodied in amendments which are before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then we come to an interesting point which I hope the Under-Secretary will be able to clarify and which is not clear at the moment. Would Justice's preference be for the clause to go altogether or, if it is amended in the way suggested, would it prefer the amended clause? From what the Under-Secretary has said, I am not clear of the current view of Justice. No doubt, he will clarify the point for us in a moment.<br><br>
I return to the point I was making before the Under-Secretary's intervention. From the quotation which he read out, the view was evidently being put forward that there was a case for using administration orders as part of a larger package and, in particular, the Payne proposals which I understand included proposals for enforcement. What we have is the part of the package, to which the quotation referred, without the proposals for enforcement. If the enforcement provisions are not included, I am not clear how the quotation really helps the Under-Secretary's case.<br><br>
Overall, our view still is—and it is supported by written statements of the working party—that the clause is best omitted and the Government amendment which we are discussing does not seem, for the reasons which I mentioned as far as assets are concerned, to meet the point. Indeed, if one were to meet the point, one would have to go a great deal further and change the whole basis and effectively implement the original Payne proposals.<br><br>
This is not a technical matter. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
points at issue are simple, political points, certainly by comparison with some of the points we had earlier on garnishee and so on. These are simple points and I do not think it is difficult for them to be explained. I hope that we can persuade the Government and, in particular, the Lord Chancellor's Department, that the case for not amending this part of the Bill in the way suggested is overwhelming. I hope we can have an undertaking from the Government in the light of what has been said—the outside representations, the ambiguity of the position of certain bodies and so on—that they will look at the point between now and Report when we can reasonably return to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have only two points to deal with relating to consultation made by the hon. Gentleman. My hon. and learned Friend will deal with the other matters.<br><br>
So far as the question of registrars is concerned, there is one specific view stated by a registrar with considerable knowledge of administration procedures—the Sheffield County Court Registrar—who expressly welcomed the idea, but it has to be viewed conjunctively with powers under Clause 9. If we did not have Clause 9, the matter of effective enforcement proposals would be diminished.<br><br>
So far as Justice's preference is concerned, I can only say to the hon. Gentleman that I have had no further representations by Justice following the meeting of March 23. I have no means of knowing whether it has changed its mind. If it has, I should have thought that it would have been the first to come forward with the proposition that Clause 8 should go. It has not said that, and it is not its view. It was not its view expressed at the meeting on March 23 and I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has evidence to suggest that Justice takes a different view from the one expressed at that time.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rather regret the form that this debate has taken. We are dealing not with emotive matters but with matters of great importance to those who are affected. I should not have thought they could engender any deep political feelings between parties. The concern of this Committee is to make
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
the procedures we are discussing effective without being oppressive. I should not have thought a party battle was helpful, nor that abrasive words were a substitute for clear thinking.<br><br>
In the course of this debate one would not have thought that we were discussing an amendment which was designed to meet some of the anxieties which have been expressed by hon. Gentlemen. If the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival)—whose anxieties have given rise to the primary amendment—were ever to succeed in raising the temperature he would have raised it this morning. Normally the hon. Gentleman and I have a good relationship in these matters—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then do not be offensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, offensive remarks did not originate from this side of the Committee. I accept that perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman did not get much sleep, but the fact is that normally we have a good relationship, and this morning he was less than his normal winsome self. He has denied that the matters we are dealing are technical. I accept that, for the hon. and learned Gentleman, legal matters of any kind, even matters on which one has no expertise, are something which can be understood. If I may say so, he is sometimes less than sympathetic with lay members on committees.<br><br>
If it will help, I say at once that I accept that I fell between two stools in my opening remarks. Without introducing a "clause stand part" debate I was trying to indicate briefly the nature of the material we are dealing with. I think I failed and fell between the two stools. I was not sufficiently detailed to give an accurate picture, and perhaps it would have been better had I said nothing about the matter. In spite of the less than persuasive style in which both hon. Gentlemen have presented their arguments, I said that I would not attempt to be dogmatic and I do not want to be. I tried to listen to the arguments as objectively as possible.<br><br>
Let me begin by trying to remedy my own omission. It has been said by both hon. Gentlemen that the real complaint is that there is no effective enforcement provision—no effective sanction—in relation to the administration order. I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
think that it has emerged from what has been said, but it should be made clear, that what we are dealing with is not an additional sanction. We are dealing with a method of introducing orderliness into a situation where we are confronted with a debtor who, one must assume, is unable—he may be unwilling—to pay the whole of his debts. The purpose of an administration order is to give him an opportunity of paying those debts in an orderly fashion.<br><br>
I accept that it is not the purpose of the order to bring together his assets. The purpose is to give the debtor an opportunity to bring his assets together without being jostled by a succession of alternative remedies—brokers' men, bailiffs hammering at the door, garnishee summonses, bankruptcy orders and so on. The purpose is to hold the ring so that his assets can be brought together and he will have an opportunity of paying in a rational way assisted by the court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has nothing to do with bringing assets together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the order is to give the debtor an opportunity of paying his debts without various creditors jostling one another trying to obtain unfair and improper priorities and giving the debtor meanwhile an opportunity of not being harassed. I think we are all agreed on the facts and purposes, and perhaps it would be a mistake for me to say any more on this and get bogged down in linguistics. It is not the purpose, but the effect, to give the debtor that opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, it has nothing to do with linguistics. The hon. Member has a series of slips of the tongue. He said just now that it was bringing the assets together. It has nothing to do with bringing the assets together. I think that we have established that point beyond any doubt. I am not disputing the linguistics. I am just saying that some of the things that the Solicitor-General says from time to time tend not to be true, and it is very confusing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us try to reduce it to the simplest and least provocative way. It gives him an opportunity of using such resources as are available to him to pay off his debts without being harassed by a series of alternative methods of enforcement
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
I am trying to deal with the points mentioned by both hon. Gentlemen. As I understand it, their criticism—although I was not involved in the previous consultations—is that there is no sanction for the order if, in fact, the debtor does not comply with the instructions of the court.<br><br>
That, of course, is not the intention of the order. It is not intended to be an additional sanction. It is to give an opportunity of bringing orderliness into dealing with the situation. But such sanction as there is is contained in Clause 9. The sanction is the revocation of the order. The concession, the opportunity of dealing with these affairs in that way, will be withdrawn from him if he fails to comply.<br><br>
The arguments of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) went even further. He said that not merely is it a criticism of this procedure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no disrespect in this—
The Chairman: If the Solicitor-General does not give way, the hon and learned Gentleman may not intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely want to make the point that in talking together my hon. Friend and I intended no disrespect to the Solicitor-General. There are times when one wants to discuss a point with one's colleague whilst it is fresh in one's mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance, but the discussion has perhaps been rather more abrasive than would have been helpful, and I do not wish to say anything which will add to that degree of abrasiveness.<br><br>
As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman was saying that it is not merely that there is no sanction here, but that there are certain pernicious matters attached to this procedure. It is not merely useless; as he put it, it is worse than useless. I grasped only one indication of that in the course of his speech, which was when he said that it can be used in certain circumstances as an act of bankruptcy. Since that is the subject of a later amendment, I hope he will forgive me, if we discuss that point when we come to it.<br><br>
I thought we should make it clear that the criticism that it does not add a sanction is a criticism not directed at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
purpose of the procedure, because that was not its purpose in the first instance.<br><br>
It has been pointed out that the enforcement office, which was mooted in the Payne Committee, will not be available to assist in this process. I do not think, in fairness, that it was pointed out in any sense of criticism. I think both the hon. Gentlemen accepted that there are good reasons why one cannot implement all the Payne recommendations at once. It was said that without the enforcement office, the court has an additional burden but has not the machinery for discharging it.<br><br>
We should get this point clear, too. As I understand it, the purpose of the enforcement office is to bring to the notice of the court any additional debts which the debtor may have. That may be something which would emerge at the stage when one is implementing the order. I am not sure that it is something that emerges at the first stage in any event and, after one has the list from the debtor, I am not sure that it adds very much to the functions of the enforcement office.<br><br>
The Payne Committee did not necessarily envisage that each part of its recommendation should be implemented simultaneously. Certainly the views—admittedly the dissenting views of Mr. Shufflebotham and Professor Wheatcroft were that they should be introduced by stages. They said so in paragraph 9 of their views, and they put the enforcement office at stage four.<br><br>
The remainder of the Committee did not specifically comment on this part of the proposal. I do not find anything in the proposals to indicate that they necessarily had in mind that the whole of their recommendation should be implemented simultaneously.<br><br>
May we now come to the remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Southport regarding the power of the court to implement this of its own motion? Perhaps it was less than generous to introduce a discussion as to whether, even if we had not introduced our amendment, there would have been power for the court to entertain an application from one of the parties.<br><br>
The amendment has been introduced and, as I understand, that part at least is common ground. There was no word of recognition that it had been introduced in that way, but I should have thought that, in general principles, where a court
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
has power to do anything, there is nothing to preclude someone in the course of the proceedings from inviting the court to take that course, and nothing to preclude the court from hearing an application of that kind.<br><br>
We have put it beyond doubt and have brought it to people's minds so that no one will overlook the possibility that they might make that application. But am not sure that it was absent from the proposal in the first instance.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked on how many occasions the court has, so far, taken advantage of its existing powers to make orders of its own motion. I must confess that we do not know, the reason for this being that no separate statistics are kept of occasions when the court makes an order upon the application of someone or when it makes an order of its own motion.<br><br>
In the past there does not seem to have been any obvious reason why those statistics should have been kept separately. It would be additional paper work for the court. When courts normally return their figures, they do not distinguish between the two kinds of situations.<br><br>
It is probably true that there cannot have been many occasions in the past when the court has made an order of its own motion. Normally, there will have been an application by someone, but sometimes I imagine if, when a debtor is before the court, he is found to be self-employed, it will have occurred—we have been talking about judges—to a judge or a registrar. These orders are normally made, of course, by registrars.<br><br>
But the answer is that we do not know. It does not follow from the fact that there are no statistics on this, but the courts have not been doing this, and I feel that we are all left in the realm of speculation.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked whether it was intended that there should be power in the court of its own motion to make such an order, even if there were representations to the contrary on both sides. The answer is: yes, it is so intended. Again I cannot imagine that there will be many occasions when the court will wish to do so.<br><br>
But as the hon. and learned Gentleman recognised, there are other parties who are interested in this matter; there are the other creditors. If it is said "The other creditors may not wish to apply", the other creditors may see this as a refuge
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1199">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
for the debtor. It is an advantage for creditors generally not to be in the position of jostling one another, forming a rugger scrum, seeking to obtain priority from one another, and knowing that each of them will have his claims looked at.<br><br>
The next point which the hon. and learned Gentleman made was in relation to his sub-amendment (a). That sub-amendment is an attempt to substitute for the words describing an administration order in the Bill the words
<br><blockquote><p>"administration order as herein defined".</p></blockquote>
As he said, the words are taken from existing legislation, from the County Courts Act 1959. They have also been repeated, of course, in the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971.<br><br>
That is not the only reason why they are included. This is one of those cases, I think, where draftsmen cannot win. We are frequently criticised for legislation by reference. The draftsman refers to something which is defined somewhere else, or which is to be found somewhere else. It is said how much easier it would be even for the practising profession, certainly how much easier for laymen who are concerned with the legislation, if he could tell us what he is talking about. That is what he has tried to do here. He has tried to describe the order. The hon. and learned Gentleman disagrees with the actual words because he says that the order does not provide for the administration of the estate. I suppose he would say that it only allows for it.<br><br>
I said at the beginning that I would not be dogmatic about this. It might be worth our looking at these words to see whether there is a better way of describing them. However, my own preference is for words which describe what we are doing rather than merely rcferring to a definition which is to be found somewhere else. Whether we have the right words is, perhaps, something that we could look at. However, I am sure the hon. and learned Gentleman will not be unmindful of the general difficulty of construction that applies. Where one uses different words, either in the same statute or in two different statutes, to refer to the same thing, the courts might be tempted to infer that one means something different. So one is up against the difficulty that, if one is going to change the wording, one has to make it abundantly clear that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
is an administration order to which one is referring. However, we will certainly look at this again to sec whether there is a better way of doing it. It may be at this stage that he may not wish to take that amendment further.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
Now may we come to the unhappy word "assets", which I accept I introduced? If it will help, I will try to clarify it. It is a word which has no specific reference throughout the whole of the legislation on this matter, but I accept that in the context in which I introduced it " further income " would have been a better way of putting it. The hon. Member for Worthing said that it is not even true that the court has to have regard to assets, because what the court is required under Amendment No. 64 to have regard to is ability to pay forthwith. As we all know, one could have very substantial assets and still be in difficulty in paying at the specific date. I accept that. However, I do not think it is true to say that assets do not come into it at all, and to describe the assertion that they do as "rubbish". Clearly, if one wants to know whether someone is able to pay his debts forthwith, it is relevant to look at his assets. That is something one should look at. Obviously, what is more relevant is liquid assets.<br><br>
It may be, as the hon. and learned Member for Southport said, that the debtor is not able to put his hands on the cash at the moment, and that would probably be the relevant consideration. Therefore, I think it might be helpful if we were to look at this provision again to see whether there is a better way of putting it, although I suspect that if we do decide that there is, and introduce an amendment, we will find that we are criticised either for going too far or not having gone far enough. However, perhaps the atmosphere will be different by then.<br><br>
As a preparation for introducing his other amendment, the hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the words in the amendment
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to rules of court".</p></blockquote>
I tried hard to follow him at that stage, but I think it was at that point where I had some difficulty in hearing him. I was not clear that I followed his argument. I should have thought the words
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to rules of court"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
in the statute in that kind of context must mean that there is power to make rules of court which will amend the way in which the subsection is to be implemented. I am not sure that I follow exactly what difficulty there is in that. One could, of course, specifically insert a power to make rules of court dealing with that if one wished. However, I do not see how it could follow that one is somehow imposing an obligation to make rules of court whether one wishes it or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond in order to clarify this point. Without the words
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to the rules of court"</p></blockquote>
the new subsection introduced in the amendment reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"and…the court shall not make such an order of its own motion without giving the parties to those proceedings an opportunity of being heard."</p></blockquote>
That is one of the things that I asked for, and I acknowledged its introduction. The introduction of the words "subject to rules" raises a doubt as to whether that provision that I have read out will, in fact, remain effective. I believe that to he important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I have now grasped what the hon. and learned Gentleman was saying. It is so. much easier to grasp these things in a cooler temperature, possibly. I see that it could give rise to a possible doubt. Again, I think it is something that we ought to consider. If the hon. and learned Gentleman will allow us to do so, certainly we shall give further consideration to that possibility.<br><br>
Finally, there is paragraph (c) with which I am much less in sympathy. I am sure that it was not intended as a wrecking amendment but, on reflection, most hon. Gentlemen will recognise that that would probably be its effect. The whole purpose of these kinds of procedure—certainly of administration orders—is to deal with certain situations—either a debtor is in danger of being immediately harassed by a succession of creditors each trying to obtain priority over the others, or his financial position is likely to get worse, so that the sooner something is done the better. The position can substantially deteriorate if something is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
done expeditiously, and whatever else may be said about this proposal, it would certainly delay matters.<br><br>
I assume that what is intended is that the notice should be served by the creditor. If that is the intention, and if the creditor merely takes the step of not serving the notice, presumably that would deprive the court entirely of the power of ordering a list of its own motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The lion. and learned Gentleman has indicated that that is what he has in mind, which rather confirms—I do not say this in a pejorative sense—that it is a wrecking amendment in practice, because the whole purpose of the clause is to extend the power of the court to make an order of its own motion. Now it would be possible by a simple negative procedure, simply by doing nothing, for the creditor to ensure that the court is deprived of that power, and that is a complete answer to the amendment, it seems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are we to understand that the lion. and learned Gentleman would like to create a situation where even though neither the debtor nor any creditor wants the order to be made none the less the court would make the order? It seems a slightly curious innovation in this field.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall devide this into two stagesi We are referring at present to the ordering of a list of debts. A few moments ago, I was trying to discuss the making of the order itself. That is the second stage—after the ordering of the list of debts. I endeavoured to answer the hon. and learned Gentleman's question as to whether it was proposed that an order might he made by a court if it thought fit although opposed by the creditor and the debtor, and, for reasons which I tried to explain, I said that that was the intention, that there might be such situations, though I did not envisage many.<br><br>
Now we are dealing with the first stage—with the order to make the list of creditors. At that stage. it does not seem to me to be very worrying that anyone should he confronted with that order without having an opportunity to make representation. All that is entailed is the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
trouble of making the list so that the court will have material for considering whether it should proceed to make the order. I really do not see that any great hardship is entailed in the court's having power to make that order without necessarily hearing the parties.<br><br>
We have perhaps to be a little careful here. We are all, of course, concerned that normally no order which might prejudice someone should be made without the court having an opportunity of hearing him if he wishes to make representations. That principle runs through the whole of our legal system.<br><br>
But there is a number of enforcement procedures where this procedure is not normal. Execution can issue against the goods of a debtor without his having an opportunity of making representations or protests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General is absolutely right to draw a distinction between the two stages and his argument would be most persuasive were it not for subsection (4), that the making of the order for the provision of a list is deemed to be an act of bankruptcy with all the consequences that may have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is trying not to intertwine two debates. We shall discuss the bankruptcy point later. That is included for the protection of the creditor who has the opportunity, if he wishes, of presenting a bankruptcy petition pending the making of the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be more convenient for the Committee to interrupt at this point rather than try to recast the whole of the Solicitor-General's argument in a subsequent speech. If the Government intend to accept the later amendment, it might be as well to say so now because it would simplify the argument a great deal in relation to a bankruptcy.<br><br>
On a previous point, is it really desirable that the courts should be able to makc an order for a list of creditors to be prepared even though no application for what might be called the second stage of the operation—namely. the enforcement of a judgment—has been in the minds either of the creditors or of the debtors at that stage of the proceedings.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Solicitor-General</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to avoid being repetitive on this. We have discussed the principle of the clause at some length. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the court should not have power to make the order unless on the application of one or other of the parties, that principle is enshrined in the clause and is not what we are debating at the moment. if he is saying that the court should not, as it were, spring the matter on people—if no one has mentioned the possibility of an order for a list of debtors or creditors in the course of proceedings—we are back to the same question—whether any great hardship is caused.<br><br>
As we proceed, points are necessarily made from time to time and we should face them carefully. This is difficult stuff! I follow the point of the intervention made by the hon. and learned Gentleman just now. I can see that although it could be said—I could say it now—that anyone who finds himself in this kind of position where he is before the court for debts must not be surprised if an order is made against him of the kind that we are talking about. But I can see that it might have the effect of his having committed an act of bankruptcy without having considered this possibility; not everyone is necessarily apprised of all the possibilities which might happen in a court in this situation. Again. this is something which I should not wish to foreclose at this stage in the debate.<br><br>
As fairly as I can, I have tried to meet the real difficulties which have emerged from our debate. If my arithmetic is right, I think I have given at least three undertakings to consider these matters further and it may be that. in the course of consideration, other difficulties will arise. As I understand the position, we are trying to achieve a method, which will be effective without being oppressive, which will prevent the debtor becoming a football among a jostling crowd of creditors, and which will not be oppressive to anyone.<br><br>
Clearly, we are dealing with matters of importancc to those whom they affect. and I hope that both lion. Members in the circumstances will be prepared to leave the matter, subject to further amendment, to give us an opportunity of considering those three matters.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have taken careful
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
note of the various undertakings given by the Solicitor-General. For the record, so that it can he studied subsequently, I make the point which I was seeking to make—indeed I hope I actually did make—on Amendment (c). As I see it, this is not related to the underlying principle of the clause as to what one might call the second stage when application is made for a judgment to be enforced or, indeed, the automatic bringing into operation of an application as a result of a list of creditors being prepared.<br><br>
What I am worried about here is that apparently, for reasons which I do not understand, we are saying that we must give the court power to ask for a list of creditors, whether or not that implies bankruptcy, even though no one has made an application to enforce a judgment—neither debtor nor creditor. That seems to be the logical sequence of events, and, if it is so, it seems a very strange sequence, because apparently the court, with no application before it from either side, is going to be given the power to demand lists of creditors from people who have had no such application made against them. I have said what I wished to say, and no doubt we can consider the point before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to disagree again. There would be no point in making a speech if one were to agree with everything, but I hope that that will not be taken as it appears to have been taken at times this morning—as personal criticism or abrasiveness. If one disagrees with something, it is best to say so straight out and seek to justify it. That is what I have done, and I think that the record will show it. Certain things that were said last time, whatever the reasons may have been were wrong, and I think that we must now have a clearer picture of the procedure with which we are dealing. For reasons which I will mention in a little while, the second speech of the Solicitor-General, in response to a number of points that we have put to him, has cleared the position, particularly on the purpose of the clause.<br><br>
My reason for rising again is to disagree with some of the points made, and I hope that I shall not be considered ungenerous for doing so. The Minister said that it was never intended that Payne should be implemented all in one, and the Solicitor-General indicated similarly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
by referring to the stages in which it was to be implemented. I agree that no one ever thought that Payne could he introduced overnight, all in one. But the error that has been made is in forgetting—for nearly six years now—that the Payne recommendations were a package. Their implementation had to be staged, but they were a package, and we have made the terrible mistake of doing the simple things without doing the difficult things, thus doing away with existing remedies without putting in their place the remedies which Payne intended.<br><br>
The classic example is the abolition of imprisonment for debt and its effect upon the judgment summons. Of course Payne recommended that and recognised that the effect would be to destroy the usefulness of the judgment summons for the ordinary civil-creditor. That is why the Payne Committee went to such lengths to stress that the Enforcement Officer should have powers to get at all the assets, because it was necessary, if the procedures were to be effective, that that should be so.<br><br>
Paragraph 800 of the Payne Report explicitly recognised that all of that also applied to the continued use of administration orders. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"As we previously stated…the modes of enforcement previously contemplated in support of an administration order were execution and committal under a judgment summons and, in our opinion, the relevant provisions, namely section 151 of the County Courts Act 1959 and Rule 16 should be repealed."</p></blockquote>
Rule 16 was I think the duty of the Registrar to take out a judgment summons for arrears of an instalment order. The paragraph continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The judgment summons procedure will, pf course, be abolished, if our recommendations are implemented. and we have in mind that, in the event of a default by a debtor, all the modes of enforcement at the Enforcement Office should be available. As we have seen elsewhere (paragraph 788 we also have in mind that, quite apart from default by the debtor, the modes of enforcement should be available as ancillaries to the order at its inception."</p></blockquote>
I do think that as a result of these debates we ought to look this straight in the eye. We have implemented parts of Payne which have reduced the effectiveness of the available processes, but have not carried out any of them which have introduced more, or strengthened the existing processes. That is why we are in such a weak position in respect of the enforcement of judgment debts in the County Court.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V003P0I1203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
Next, I hope the Minister will not think it ungenerous of me to point out that the recommendation in paragraph 40 of the Justice report was
<br><blockquote><p>"that the power which already exists lo extend by Order in Council the scope of the administration order procedure should be exercised more frequently."</p></blockquote>
This is a question of the maximum amount of the debts. The power to use the administration order procedure is governed by the total of the debts known. It was always so where in the first instance the procedure was available of the debts did not exceed£50. It was increased to£300, then£500, and then£1,000. Justice is here suggesting that the power by Order in Council to increase that sum should be used more frequently. There is a good argument for that. I do not think there is any basic dispute there. That is however quite a different proposition from recommending extending the administration order provisions to enable a court to make such an order of its own motion.<br><br>
As regards the many observations made by the Minister about Justice and the representations and consultations, if he reads again what he said he may find that it is a pretty threadbare case for saying that there is any support for the clause. He might also feel that what he said was very poor grounds for his somewhat offensive suggestion that I had been "caught out."<br><br>
I do not think that there is any support for what is being done except from the Sheffield registrar who appeared on the scene at the last moment and who apparently said that, provided we have Clause 9, Clause 8 is all right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Clinton Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Sheffield registrar appeared on the scene from almost the first moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All right. He appeared on our scene at the first moment. Perhaps I should have said more fully, " of whom we did not hear until the very last moment." 'the Minister might consider later whether that is a good premise for his argument.<br><br>
Much more important is that I hope we now have clear what sort of process we are talking about. It is wrong to talk about any control over the assets. The only thing which could come within that terminology is the power to issue a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
warrant where there are goods in excess of £10 after allowing for certain disregards. That is not a very important provision. Execution on goods is not something peculiar to administration orders, and the execution which is provided for under the 1959 Act is no more effective than any other execution on goods. It is limited to goods, and does not extend to any other kind of assets.<br><br>
I hope that we now have it clear in our minds that we are talking about the power of court to order payment by instalments—payment of instalments out of future income. That is all that can be in the order, because the form of the order is prescribed, and the court can only make the order in the prescribed form. The rules say so. Therefore, the court can only make an order for future payments out of earnings by instalments. In fact, "out of earnings" is not specified, but the court is required to be satisfied that there is income out of which to pay them. I do not think we should quarrel about that.<br><br>
That is what we are talking about. That is the order that is made, if any order is made. The powers of enforcement are solely and simply those powers to issue a warrant for execution, with the power to revoke the order, plus Clause 9 which we shall come to later but which one must disregard for the moment. It is not a method of enforcing the order but rather provides for what may happen if the order is not complied with. The order is replaced by something else. One may say that it is a threat, which may keep the person up to scratch. However, it does not come under the general term of provisions for enforcement of an order, but rather provides circumstances in which an order may be got rid of, nullified, cancelled.<br><br>
But what is most interesting, and which we shall want to look at most closely, is this. The Solicitor-General said that the reason for introducing the clause is to make available, of the court's own motion, a method of introducing orderliness into the payment by a debtor of his debts; to prevent him from being harassed; to enable him to have the opportunity to organise his affairs and keep up payment of instalments and so not to be harassed and so on. n other words, the Solicitor-General has reverted here to the original purpose of administration

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
orders. This is why they were available only at the request of a debtor. They were a form protection for the debtor. The procedure formed no part of the armoury of weapons of the judgment creditor at any stage.<br><br>
I think that what he has made clear—and we shall look at the record with interest—is that that is how he sees Clause 8. It is not introduced to increase the armoury of weapons available to a creditor for enforcing a judgment. It is to give a protection to a debtor so that he may have the opportunity so to organise' his affairs as to pay his debts.<br><br>
That I can understand. It is in the true spirit and in accordance with the true nature, of administration orders as they have always existed. But it entirely gives the lie to one argument which has been advanced hitherto, namely that the purpose of Clause 8 is in some way to fill the gap in the weapons available to judgment creditors which will be increased by the raising of the limits under Clause 1. Under Clause 1, the limit below which a bankruptcy petition cannot be filed is raised from£50to£300, and it has been accepted all the way through that that would mean depriving a judgment creditor of what seems now to be his best remedy for cases where the judgment debt is under£300.<br><br>
But it has been said, from the Second Reading in the other place right through, that accepting that the changes we have made in Clause I would weaken the position of the judgment creditor, that would to some extent be made up for by extending the use of administration orders under Clause 8. It now seems clear that that is not the view taken by the Solicitor-General, and that he recognises that it would add nothing to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
armoury of weapons available to the judgment creditor. I think that he is right, and that in expressing that point of view he has looked fairly in the face the fact that there are virtually no means of enforcing the order, which is what a judgment creditor is interested in. He agrees but says that is not relevant on Clause 8 because we are not thinking here in terms of a remedy for or enforceability by a judgment creditor. We are thinking about protecting the judgment debtor.<br><br>
The points of details which I raised, and which were referred to by the Solicitor-General at the end of his speech, include the question of the use of the words "administration of the estate." I agree with him: let us choose words in the statutes which describe what is to be done and as nearly as possible in language which people understand. The whole point here is that the words "an order for the administration of the estate" do not describe what is to be done when this procedure is used. On the contrary, they describe something which is not going to be done. I see force in what he says about my wording. Perhaps the right thing to do is to describe the order as it will be, by saying for instance:
<br><blockquote><p>"may make an order for the payment of instalments by whatever amount and at whatever period may be specified in the order."</p></blockquote>
That would describe what is, in fact, going to be done—</span></p>
