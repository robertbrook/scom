	<div class='title'>—(Effect of development schemes.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. DAVID GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 28, to leave out from the word "relates" to the word "and" in line 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to what is, perhaps, the most important part of the Bill. The object of the Bill, as we are told and as we readily accept, is to limit the flow of goods on to the British market, in order that producers at home may have a reasonable price for the goods which they produce and market in their own country. The first means by which that end is to be attained is by the issue of Orders limiting imports from foreign countries. The second means is by agreements between this country and other producing countries for determining the amount of agricultural products of various kinds to be imported. The sole object of that limitation of imports has been described to us as the encouragement of home production by raising the average level prices and giving more or less security that commodities produced by farming operations in this country will find an assured market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We who criticise the Bill said downstairs, and we say here, that there is a feature in the Bill which does not correspond with the object I have just described. That object is not, solely, to give encouragement to the home producer but to enable him to increase his production and his remuneration and profit from his industry. In this Clause however, we come to a most objectionable feature of the Bill and that is a provision directed actually towards the re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
duction of home production. In this Clause we find it stated that one of the intentions is to permit the production of secondary products only on licence. This production is to be under schemes set up by producers coming together for the purpose of dealing with the secondary products of their respective branches of the industry. The conditions attaching to these licences are described in the Clause. The Clause sets out that the development board is empowered to grant a producer's licence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to such conditions as the board, having regard to the interests of the persons registered as producers under the related marketing schemes, think necessary for promoting efficient production of the said product in the premises to which the licence relates."—</p></blockquote>
We go so far without offering any Amendment to the proposal in the Bill, but then the wording of the Clause proceeds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or for preventing or reducing excessive production of that product."</p></blockquote>
That is where we beg to differ from the Government. We wish to test the Government and their supporters on this point. They say that the object of the Bill is to give more employment, more profit, and more security to those engaged in agriculture at home. As a means of finding the additional employment there is the assured market. There is, further, the part of the Bill upon which we are now engaged, which relates to the setting up of industries for the manufacture of secondary products. Those products are not enumerated in the Clause, but we know that milk schemes and bacon schemes are in operation, and that probably there will be butter schemes and factories for the production of bacon, milk, and butter products, as well as other commodities. But in this Clause, the Minister and those who support him appear to lack confidence in their own Bill, because they say in effect, "We are prepared to provide machinery, not for increasing the production of the secondary products of home agriculture, but machinery which is possibly going to limit and restrict the production of those commodities." Indeed they say so in terms. They say that the development board shall issue licences subject to the need "for preventing or reducing excessive production." A licence may be denied or withdrawn on the ground that if it were given too much work might be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
done at home; too many people might be given employment; too much capital might be employed, and there would be a danger of too much production of bacon, butter and milk products. Yet I am sure that hon. Members opposite all agree that those are necessary home industries if agriculture is to derive the full benefit from this or any other organisation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see anyone blushing, but I can hardly imagine any representative of agriculture defending this part of the Bill in his own constituency or anywhere else in the country. How can anyone who claims to represent agriculture, and whose ambition it is that agriculture should be revived and fostered and built up into a powerful industry, face his constituents, or people who might be identified, by means of these secondary industries, with the productive side of agriculture, to defend a system of licences which commences by saying that under certain conditions, because of excessive production, or what might be termed excessive production, these industries are not to be permitted to be established in this country. It is most startling to find a provision like this in a Bill. I represent a mining constituency, and I know that, as soon as the Minister rises to reply, he will tell me that I represent an industry in which already restriction is imposed. That is true, but the cases are not analogous at all, and I am assisting the Minister and the Committee by meeting that argument before he submits it. It is true that there is a form of restriction on the production of coal in this country, not because anyone wants to interfere with the supply of coal for domestic consumption, but in order to prevent this industry—which is an exporting industry solely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of AGRICULTURE (Major Elliot)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not solely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not an importing industry. It exports its surplus product, and it does not import the commodity which it produces, and there is good ground for limiting in a reasonable measure the production in such an industry. But in the industry which we are now considering there is no comparison with that at all, because here we have the beginning of an industry which is said to be designed and intended to supply
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
the home market only, and is working, with the assistance of special measures, to exclude competition from abroad, and under the shelter of importation Orders; and I think it is making a very bad start indeed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir JOSEPH LAMB</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman remember that the industry to which he has referred has to compete with imported oil?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is another thing. I was speaking of coal, and perhaps I may be allowed to deal with one industry at a time. I could go on to deal with oil if the hon. Member likes, but there is no home production of oil—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At any rate, there is none worth mentioning; there is no comparison; there is no duplicate of this kind of thing in our economic system up to date. The Government are introducing an entirely new principle. In their avowed desire to help agriculture, they are starting out with the possibility of such restrictions as may cripple agriculture and the secondary industries built up on the agricultural industry. One would like to hear what the Minister has to say in reply, but we know of no reason at all why this provision should be in the Bill. It suggests a lack of confidence on the part of the Minister and his supporters; it is a direct contradiction of their declarations regarding the objects of the Bill; it involves the possibility of seriously retarding the development of these secondary products, and of denying to British workmen the chance of working at home on capital produced at home for the supply of the home market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the Minister has to say in justification of this. Danish products of every kind can come in—secondary products and raw products—if we are to judge from the agreements already made. I did say some time ago that it might be 10 or 20 years before the President of the Board of Trade completed these agreements, and I wish he were taking more time on them. He is now hastily bringing before the House and the country an agreement that might bind this country for 10 or 20 years, an agreement which is almost entirely one-sided in favour of the producers of agricultural products in other parts of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
world. It would really be a good thing for the agricultural industry if the President of the Board of Trade were not so expeditious in the negotiations which he is conducting. But this is a slightly different thing. I am watching you, Sir Cyril, in case you may rule me out of order, because I know that I am not allowed to discuss that point, but we are in danger, not only of being overwhelmed by the surplus raw products of the agriculture of other lands, but also of permitting secondary products, manufactured products of agriculture, to come into this country. We are in danger of being swamped and overwhelmed. Let us at least act, in setting up these secondary industries in our own country, so that there may be sufficient confidence to attract the necessary capital and support from the country to build them up, not with a view to restricting production, but with a view to considerably increasing the production of secondary products of all kinds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOLDSWORTH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that every Member of the Committee must be astounded at the arguments of the hon. Gentleman, coming from such a quarter. There are those who say that the purpose of this Bill is to prevent or reduce excessive production. I have heard arguments times without number, in my 18 months' experience in the House, somewhat on these lines: What is the use of bringing coal to the pit top if it cannot be sold? I think that that is what is really behind the Bill. I think that, as representing my party, I can say a word on this, particular question. It is a serious question. Surely the term "excessive production" is rather a relative term. Very often the fact that a person is producing a tremendous amount of a particular kind of goods is due to his being a competent producer, and I should like to know whether, if there is going to be any limitation, there would be any danger, if a large and really sound business were producing efficiently, of restriction of production in the case of that particular type of firm. I do not believe the Minister can tell us how this will be actually carried out in practice, but it has been represented to me by many big firms that they are afraid that under this particular provision, because they are efficient, their production may
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
be regulated. I can quite see that, if there is to be regulation, the Minister wants to fit the whole scheme into all home and foreign production, but there is a danger that an efficient firm might, because of its efficiency and high production, be cut down by regulation of the manufacture of its product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure I shall not have the difficulty which the hon. Member fears in answering the point that he has put. We have heard arguments for a complete suppression of international trade urged by a professed internationalist; we have heard an argument for disorganised production urged by an apostle of organised labour; we have heard an argument for an altogether disproportionate trust in the merits of the Measures of a National Government urged by a professed leader of the Opposition. That is a series of paradoxes which I think is quite enough for one morning. We believe, as I said during the sixth day's proceedings, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is desirable that the expansion should be an orderly expansion, and that, if the market cannot stand an expansion, that expansion should not take place, because the undesirability of glut supplies being hurled on a market from within, and of immature supplies being hurled on the market to deal with a gap which has been artificially created, over and above what the market can stand, are two of the gravest dangers before British agriculturists in the years immediately ahead of us."—[OFFICIAL REPORT (	<i>Standing Committee C</i>), 27th April, 1933; col. 220.]</p></blockquote>
Let the Committee follow through the procedure in the Bill. A development scheme is submitted, that is to say, a scheme drawn up by two boards, the producers' boards. A notice has to be published, and objections have to be heard. The meetings which are laid down in the First Schedule, of the persons registered as producers under the scheme, have to take place. The scheme has to be approved in terms of the draft by the decision of each such meeting, and then the scheme has to come to the Minister, and the Minister has to approve of it and lay the draft scheme before each House of Parliament, and each House of Parliament has to sanction it by an affirmative Resolution. Is it to be said that, after all these precautions have been observed, it should not be possible for such a development board to have the power of regulation of excessive produc-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
tion if excessive production is likely to take place? That seems to us to be an altogether nineteenth century conception of the conditions under which production has to take place nowadays. Let us further note that in the development scheme itself there are members representing each section—there are three members appointed by the Minister, and representatives of the producers, as against the representatives of the processers, who might be considered to have an interest in keeping up a water-tight ring, and not allowing new persons to come into the industry. If, after all these precautions, it has been found possible to convince a majority of the board that it is undesirable that further facilities for the processing of particular products should be given, or that those facilities, in certain instances, should be reduced, I say that a case has been made out to such an extent that it would be sheer folly for this Committee to refuse that possibility to a board drawn up with, and acting under, all these very stringent precautions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHRISTIE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 29, after the word "product" to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"so that, however, no such condition shall prejudice the development of production of that product within the United Kingdom unless there are no importations of such products from foreign countries."</p></blockquote>
I think it would be better if the hon. Gentleman who moved the last Amendment gave a little assistance to this one, because, while I think the Minister's answer to him was an excellent one, I think it will be more difficult for my right hon. Friend to knock down the argument underlying the Amendment which I am moving. These development boards will have very great powers. They will, I suppose, if the Minister's scheme goes as well as he hopes, dominate the productions of foodstuffs in this country. They will have the power of purchasing the business of competitors and they will be in a very strong position. While the Minister has made out an admirable case for giving them the power of limiting production, if there is the possibility of a home glut, and that power is absolutely essential for them to have, we ought to do everything we can to protect the producer against a limitation of home pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
duction so long as importations are coming in from abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should very much like to have put into the Amendment the words "from overseas," which would have included Empire importations, but I imagine that so long as the Ottawa Agreements are in force that would be a hopeless thing to do. I suggest to the right hon. Gentleman that this gives a perfectly fair and just measure of protection to the home producer. We should then be perfectly confident that unless limitation were necessary to prevent over-production in this country, it would not mean limitation, so long as there were importations of a similar product from a foreign country. I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept the Amendment. He is always most polite and charming when he puts the case for the Government against an Amendment, and I hope that this time he will not get up and say that, while he sympathises with the sentiment underlying this Amendment and while it is an excellent Amendment, it has two faults, one of which is it is in the wrong place and the other is that if carried into law it would have exactly the opposite effect to that intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope not to disappoint my hon. Friend by the method with which I controvert his Amendment. I will say to him at once that the Amendment is admirable to carry out the purpose which he has in mind, it is in absolutely the correct place and that, if carried out, it would have absolutely the object which he desires, I must, however, ask the Committee not to accept the Amendment, for the simple reason that we must look forward for a considerable period—I do not say indefinitely, though in some cases I think that we must look forward indefinitely—to a continuation of foreign importations of food into this country. Take the example of sugar: it is very improbable that, at any date which we can see, we shall produce the whole of the sugar which we require in this country. If there are certain products, say fresh milk or possibly potatoes, in which we can easily contemplate a moment when there would be no importations whatever, there are others in which I do not think in the near future we may look forward to such immediate developments. Therefore, during the whole of the period, the unregulated production
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
and possibly the unregulated expansion which, we all agreed, it may be necessary for us to guide and even to check, might go on. I am sure that that would not be the desire of my hon. Friend himself, nor would it be the desire of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certain for a period to come that the bacon will continue to come in from abroad. A great quantity of bacon is imported into this country, and even the Lane Fox Commission's 10 per cent. expansion for four months would still leave, at the end of three years, a considerable quantity of bacon coming in from abroad. It is quite possible that at the end of the three years we may need the organised production of bacon in certain areas in this country. I think that the words "shall prejudice" in the Amendment are very wide words. As I have said, it is an admirable Amendment and it is absolutely in the right place. Because it is so accurately in the right place, it would have such a clamping effect that I must ask the Committee not to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to disappoint the hon. Gentleman who invited my co-operation on this Amendment. He has a very much stronger case than the Minister has credited him with. The hon. Gentleman represents what the agricultural Members of this House, and I thought every Tory, stood for. The Tory mind is quite unfathomable to a man like myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing it with the Whig mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought, where the home market was overflowing and there were, in the words of the Bill, excessive quantities of goods coming into this country, that the home industry, whether agriculture, iron and steel, or any other industry, should be encouraged to defeat that competition. The whole idea of Protection is that idea. This is not a case of Protection and of fiscal interference, but of the granting of licences and of just telling a fellow to go on and do the work. That is all that the Government propose to give. There is no financial assistance in this. You tell a company or an individual—it must be a company, when they are working under the auspices of these two Boards—to get
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
on with the work of producing, and you give them permission to work and to employ their fellow-countrymen. The Minister says, "We cannot give them protection, because there may be excessive production."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me ask what determines whether production is excessive. Excessive production will probably depend upon the amount of the product on the market. Excessive production at home may be due to the quantity of goods coming from abroad. Let us take any figures you like. Let us say that the imported products are a million, and that the home manufactured products are one hundred thousand, and you find that the market can accept only a million for the time being. Would you say that the one hundred thousand home production is all surplus and all excessive production? When do you say that there is excessive production at home? The hon. Gentleman who moved the Amendment said that there is no excessive production at home so long as there is importation. That is his case. I agree with him, and so should every Tory. There is no excessive production at home so long as your markets are supplied with goods produced from abroad. The hon. Gentleman has not gone as far as that, but I am putting the extreme case for the purpose of my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that licences should not be denied so long as there is a product which is subject to the competition of imported products, and that where there is importation there shall not be deemed to be excessive production at home. While he is not using the same point as I, I say that it is a revelation to me that members of the agricultural industry can turn down the hon. Gentleman's Amendment. My Amendment may techically have sounded an interference. I want to cut out of the Bill something which the majority of hon. Members might want to leave in, but I do not think that any Conservative Member can rightly argue against the Amendment moved by the hon. Gentleman. To do so is to repudiate the whole principle of Protection and the contention made by Conservatives that their intention is to foster home production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Grenfell) has asked what is excessive production. He thinks that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
depends upon the relation between importation and the production at home. Excessive production is when production exceeds consumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make my point quite clear. Is the hon. Gentleman prepared to say that there is excessive production at home when 80 per cent., or 60 per cent., of the supplies come from abroad at the same time, and when only a small part of the production is carried on at home and the bulk is carried on entirely abroad?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir J. LAMB</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different point entirely. The hon. Member for Gower was asking what was excessive production, and I said that it was when production was greater than consumption. There must be a relative position between the two. I hope that the Minister will not accept this Amendment, which would be a regulation against the importer and not against the home producer. There are certain times when there must be the power, in cases of excessive production at home, and in the interests of legitimate producers at home, to give a measure of protection. As the Minister says, we have had trouble with potatoes. We can probably produce in this country all that is adequate for our necessities, yet there are times when there has been a glut on the market and the farmer has found that the whole of his crop has been unproductive because it has been in excess of production. I hope that by the action of the organisation which we are going to set up under the Bill we shall increase production, but that will only be when there is also an increased consumption in some cases. The confidence that will be created in the minds of the public with regard to the quality and quantity and prices of the articles that we produce under organisation will be such that the public will probably consume more. The Committee will then be able to regulate production, and so more can be produced at home. Until that condition has arrived there must be some protection for the home producer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make an appeal to the Committee? We have a great deal to do and we have only an hour and a-quarter to devote to the whole of Part II, two very long Clauses, by agreement. I beg the Committee to avoid any necessity for an afternoon sitting, which otherwise would be inevitable if we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
to complete the Bill in accordance with the schedule which we have set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHRISTIE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose, after the Minister's appeal, that I must ask leave to withdraw my Amendment, but I am very disappointed that the Committee have taken that point of view. I think that it is an astounding point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Amendment made: In page 6, line 35, after the word "of," insert the word "any."—[	<i>Major Elliot.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 38, after the word "not," to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(unless such a licence previously granted in respect of those premises has been revoked)."</p></blockquote>
This is simply to indicate that if a licence of a producer has been revoked for not observing the conditions, the producer should not be able to claim the protection of the Proviso to Clause 1 to obtain a new licence. It would obviously be foolish if the revocation of a licence were immediately followed by the granting of a new one. I hope that the Committee will see its way to accept this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LEONARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 42, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ii) that the grant of such a licence shall not be refused in respect of any premises where the production of the secondary product there carried on was, prior to the relevant date, carried on by a British undertaking in a foreign country; and,"</p></blockquote>
The words "British undertaking" in the Amendment may apply to groups of capital or of individuals in this country. I am specifically concerned with the activities of the co-operative movement, and it is from their angle that I express myself this morning. It cannot be denied that the co-operative movement has always endeavoured to promote the welfare of agriculture, not perhaps because of agriculture itself, but because of the intimacy that agricultural products have to the interest of the consuming people of this country. Being primarily a consumers' organisation it was natural that they should be well disposed to agriculture. They have endeavoured to help in very tangible forms efforts made by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
agriculturists to apply the principle of co-operation. The Minister of Agriculture must be aware of agricultural co-operative organisations that would have collapsed had it not been for the financial help given to them by the co-operative societies of this country. Moreover, the same co-operative agricultural organisations have received considerable help from the guidance they have obtained from the Scottish and English Co-operative Wholesale Societies, through their experts. We have also made continuous efforts—I am dealing with points that cannot be denied—to bring the agricultural producers closer to the consumer, believing that to be not only to the consumer's advantage, but to the distinct advantage of the producer himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying thoughts in regard to the Amendment are not based upon theorising but upon experience. The experience of the co-operative societies as far as their factories are concerned has been that they have been unable to get what their factories require. They have been unable to get regularity of supply. Hon. Members will readily see that one cannot go ahead in the production of goods unless the supply is assured. There is also the quesion of suitability of supply of all that is required by the factories. One might point out that in the report of the Pig Commission there is a formidable list of weaknesses in connection with that industry. The weaknesses are about 15 in number, and those weaknesses in the pig industry were weaknesses which the co-operative societies in their producing plant had to face in this country. These faults were not ours. They were imperfections in marketing and in quality, and we had to pay attention to them and escape from them if redress could not be secured in this country. I am particularly referring to bacon. The result of the imperfections in the supply and quality of pigs made it absolutely imperative for those working-class organisations to which I have referred to place factories where they could get regularity of supply and where they could have a pig given to them that would guarantee the proper type of bacon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LEONARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this country they have in a small measure entered into farming. That question can be touched upon later if desired. The fact is that in regard to the supply of pigs it was not possible to get the requirements in this country. Therefore they had to go abroad and erect factories in order to meet the difficulty. This Clause introduces the system of licences. Its object is the limitation and control of production, and it must be taken in conjunction with the previous Clauses that we have passed. As the Clause gives power to fix import quotas and limit supplies from abroad, we would ask the Committee, for the reasons I have given, to accept our Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LEONARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There are two other factories, one in England and one in Scotland. I am referring to the necessity placed upon us to erect factories in Denmark, where the supply is regular and the quality satisfactory. Large sums drawn from working-class sources have been invested in those factories in order that the product of the factories should come here not so much to compete in the home market but to supply those people with their own requirements in the shape of food. If there is to be a limit placed upon the activities of those factories through the medium of the issue of licences, it will jeopardise the activities already entered into by these societies of working people in their efforts to get the requisite amount of suitable food, and we are not prepared to allow that to go without registering our protest and making an effort to modify the position. We desire, therefore, to amend the Clause in accordance with the terms of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making any wild claims when I suggest that we are only asking for equality. We are supported in our attitude to a considerable extent by the references of the Lane Fox Reorganisation Commission on the Pig Industry. I find on page 57 of that Report, dealing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
with the question of factory capacity, the following statement:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think that consideration should be given to curers who, in the interests of both pig producers and the bacon industry at home, are prepared to transfer factory accommodation from foreign countries to the United Kingdom and especially to those who are also in a position to sell the bacon they produce direct to the consumer."</p></blockquote>
There is clarity in that statement, and in detail it supports the assertions we are making and the Amendment we have put forward. It is only a matter of days since the Minister of Agriculture himself in the House stated with regard to the Government's policy covering the pig industry that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government, for their part, have accepted in principle the commission's recommendations. That is to say, they are prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to facilitate the establishment of a reorganised bacon industry in this country, on a firm footing, to provide for its extension within reasonable limits and to regulate imports."</p></blockquote>
If the Government have accepted the Commission's Report, there should be very little reluctance in accepting our Amendment. The Commission came to their conclusions not hastily but after exhaustive and detailed inquiry, in which the evidence was very comprehensive and the co-operative societies themselves indulged. We are not asking for any privilege in the sense of privilege. All that we are asking for is something that will be conducive to the desires of the Government in promoting reorganisation, whilst not hampering or hindering efforts that have been made to meet the needs of this country in the past. Moreover, in the assertions of the Lane Fox Commission we consider that we have received considerable support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has appealed to Caesar and therefore to Caesar he must go. I will read the relevant passages of the Lane Fox Commission's Report, which will be particularly interesting to the hon. Member since he has agreed that they should apply in his case and that the Government have intimated that they will apply them in the case of bacon. On page 56 the report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Existing factories in the United Kingdom, if properly utilized, have, therefore, a capacity enormously in excess of their present output and of their probable out-
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
put for some years to come. In the interests of efficiency, it will be desirable to concentrate production as far as possible. We therefore recommend that the Quota Advisory Committee should insist that the curing industry should rationalize the utilisation of its factory capacity. The Pig Industry Development Board should be the instrument for preparing and supervising the plan of rationalisation. The sanction of this body should be required for all new construction or for extensions of existing factories, subject to appeal to the Committee of Investigation set up under the Agricultural Marketing Act."</p></blockquote>
That is the verdict of Caesar and in the procedure which we are proposing to set up in this Clause, to establish a Development Board before which all this consideration should be brought, we are fully carrying out the proposals of the Lane Fox Commission. I fully agree that it is desirable that consideration should be given to undertakings which desire to transfer production from a foreign country to this country, and I would point out to my hon. Friend that the procedure contemplated in the Bill and the procedure contemplated under the Marketing Act is that if a Development Board refuses a licence and a complaint is made to the Minister that a licence has been improperly refused, the Minister may refer the complaint to the Committee of Investigation, and if he thinks that the Development Board has acted in a manner not only contrary to the interests of the persons affected but contrary to the public interests, he may, by order, direct the Development Board to rectify the matter. Therefore, I have the power. The appeal lies to me, I am in the position of a judge when the appeal comes before me and, obviously, it would be wrong for me before the appeal is made to accept an Amendment which cuts directly against the main recommendation of the Lane Fox Commission on this point. Therefore, I ask my hon. Friend to accept my assurance that I am sympathetic towards the transfer of production from a foreign country to this, that there is full support for his view to be expressed, not in general but before the Committee of Investigation, and that it will be my duty to take account of the facts brought out by that Committee of Investigation. In that way the consideration which the Lane Fox Commission said ought to be extended to curers will be given in the working of the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. LEONARD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 45, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(iii) that the granting of such a licence shall not be refused in respect of any premises in which the secondary product is produced by a mutual trading organisation which is able to prove that the secondary product is produced on an economic basis in order to meet the demands of its constituent organisations or members."</p></blockquote>
I move this Amendment because of the incidents of the organisations of consumers to which I have already referred. We desire that where it can be demonstrated that their increased membership is demanding increased supplies of any secondary product, we should be granted a licence without question. If the Clause goes through as it stands it will be possible for any Development Board to limit our development and to compel us to take our supplies from other manufacturers. In view of the fact that we have in the past endeavoured to ascertain the requirements of the constituents of our organisations, and that we have just as consciously endeavoured to cope with those requirements, we consider that our request in the Amendment is justifiable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will agree that we had a discussion on this point at a previous stage of the Bill. It was not possible for me to accept the Amendment then, and I am afraid that it is not possible for me to accept it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major MILNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 7, line, 4, to leave out the words "first day of March," and to insert instead thereof the words "thirty-first day of December."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Committee will agree that the 1st March, being, as in fact it was, a date prior to the actual printing of the Bill, is too early as a relevant date under this Sub-section. The intention here apparently is that there shall be some safeguard with regard to businesses or premises in which the secondary product was being produced during the six months prior to the 1st March. That is in effect limiting the grant of licences to a large extent to present producers. I suggest that arbitrarily to fix a date prior to the introduction of the Bill, prior
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
indeed to its printing, and prior to there being any knowledge as to the details likely to be included in the Bill, is distinctly unfair, and that a reasonable and proper date might be the 31st December. It seems to me also that there ought to be some time given for organisations, whether those indicated by my hon. Friend behind or others, to enable them to decide whether or not to remove into this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order not to take up time, I did not add my voice to that of my hon. Friend, although I am entirely in sympathy with him, but I regard the position as to the setting up of factories in this country by organisations which at present carry on factories abroad as a mere substitution of a supply from this country for a supply from abroad. Facilities, schemes, and organisations under the original Agricultural Marketing Act, now being set up in this country, it is possible for large organisations to transfer to this country with some confidence that their demands will be met. I had some knowledge, doubtless with other hon. Members, of the bacon scheme in Yorkshire, which was unregulated, in which farmers unfortunately did not send all their products to the Yorkshire bacon factory, and which passed through many vicissitudes. We believe that under these Agricultural Marketing Acts those times have passed, and surely, therefore, there should be time and opportunity for organisations or individuals to consider whether or not they should transfer their factories or producing establishments to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, it appears, the Bill unduly restricts the power to grant licences to those businesses which are carrying on in this country. There is no scope for development or extension, and I suggest, therefore, that this date might well be altered to the 31st December. In the original Agricultural Marketing Acts this point was frequently raised, and I think I am right in saying that the dates were frequently altered, so as to meet objections similar to this. I therefore hope the Minister will accept this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be relevant, suppose that we were saying that a licence should not be granted to anybody, but what we say is that a licence shall not be refused to anybody, which is a very different thing. The Board has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
complete discretion to grant licences, and no doubt will, to people coming into the industry. This is merely so that the Board shall not refuse licences to people already in the business, and I think that is fair. I do not think there is any point in extending the date, because the Board has discretion to consider people who are coming in afterwards. I am sure the difference will appeal to the hon. and gallant Member, and I hope he will not press his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is to make sure that these cartels dispose of the premises. In order to give everyone confidence and to put the matter on business lines, I think we should put it that they must sell at the best price they can get in the open market, and that there can be no trickery, such as saying, "The premises next door would suit us, and therefore we think fit to take them." I hope that some words of this sort, to ensure the best price available being taken, will be accepted. The Minister has not accepted any of our Amendments yet, and I very much hope he will see fit to accept this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While having every desire to accept one or other of the Amendments moved by my hon. and gallant Friend, I would not like to cheat him by accepting this, which does not really make any alteration whatever in the structure of the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it really desirable to put words like that in a Statute? All its other activities ought to be carried out in a businesslike fashion, and one might put in a broad general Amendment, that in all its transactions the Board should act in a businesslike fashion and obtain the best terms available, but I am sure we should not desire to see such words in a Statute. The board will be spending its own money. If it wastes it, it will be called to account by its constituents, and I am certain that one could no more insert words such as these in the Statute
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
governing these boards and expect them to have meaning, than one could insert the words in the constitution of a company and expect them to have meaning. In the long run the discretion of the directors or of the Development Commissioners must be the safeguard which their constituents have that their money is being properly looked after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed. A huge constituency such as that of a huge cartel will have no chance of making their own views known. They will not know what is going on in their own district, and it is well to have an extra safeguard for their members. We think that some such words as these are necessary. It is all very well to say that the board will look at it from a businesslike point of view. It may be easy to say that they will take certain quarters, and give them some other quarters, but I think the constituents of a huge cartel like this ought to be safeguarded in the Bill as well as by their businesslike directors. If we cannot have the Amendment accepted, however, I shall have to ask leave to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 7, line 25, after the word "licence," to insert the words "(or to any person employed by him)."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry the hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite was not prepared to press his Amendment, because I sympathise with the shareholders of a company, who might not get a square deal when premises are to be sold or otherwise disposed of. I come now to another class of people who might be prejudicially influenced by the refusal of a licence. The intention of this Amendment is to make the compensation scheme provided under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of Sub-section (3) cover everybody who might be subject to loss, either loss of capital or loss of employment and wages, by the refusal to grant a licence or by the closing down of a plant in which the workpeople and capital are employed. There is no reference to the workpeople anywhere in this Bill, and while the Government lay down machinery by which compensation shall be assessed, we want them to show the same care for and interest in the workpeople who might be thrown out of employment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
and caused loss by the operations of this Bill. Sub-section (3) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Every development scheme shall provide for the following matters, that is to say:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) for securing that, in such class of cases as may be specified in the scheme or determined by the development board, compensation shall be payable by the board to any applicant for a producer's licence who is aggrieved by the refusal of the board to grant the licence or by any conditions attached thereto, as the case may be."</p></blockquote>
I cannot visualise the extent of loss which may be sustained by a person referred to in this paragraph. There may be a producer or a factory with a capital worth, say, £10,000, or £20,000, or £50,000, who may suffer loss because of the reasons specified by the Minister himself, who said, quoting the Lane Pox Report, that there is redundant plant in the country for certain secondary products at the present time, and that the anticipations are that some of these plants will not be given licences, in the interests of efficient production. The Minister has been kind enough to the owners of capital, and says in advance that if they are aggrieved by the failure of the board to grant them a licence, they can make application, and compensation to them can be assessed; but nothing is said about the workpeople, and one cannot imagine that the loss will be limited to the owners of capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A factory working in a small village may employ from 20 to 100 people, and may be the only means of employment for the people in the village. They may have come there for that special form of employment, when the factory was erected, and when the capitalist came to employ capital there. The capitalist goes away with his capital more or less intact, but nothing is done for the people who have invested the only capital which they have, namely, their homes, their domestic life, and their labour, in this enterprise. We ask that the workpeople shall not go without consideration and that there shall be compensation, but we have not prescribed the scale. We have not thought fit to do that in an Amendment of this kind, but we say that the principle of compensation for the workpeople shall not be lost sight of, and we ask the Committee to join us in that demand. This is not entirely a new demand. When the
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
Electricity Act was before this House in 1927, provision was made, in Committee, for considering the claims of workpeople when certain stations were closed down under the operations of that Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the Coal Mines Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, but what I mean is that there was no such provision in the Coal Mines Act as the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, when the Coal Mines Bill was going through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that Mr. William Graham was compelled to forgo many things that we would have liked to have accomplished in the House, and that was probably one of them, but the Minister is not very precise in his reference, and I cannot argue with him on the point. I say, however, that there is a principle here, and I am sure the Committee will feel satisfied that provision should be made for workpeople where it can be shown that they have individually sustained loss by failure to maintain their working place and to continue their employment in producing a product which is now, in the interests of agriculture, to be interfered with by the State by a system of State licences and registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the hon. Gentleman has made, as always, a very strong, persuasive case for his Amendment, and I apologise to him for my interruption, because I know how difficult it is, when one is developing an argument, to have it interrupted. I merely wished to indicate, after his reference to the Electricity Bill, that subsequent Statutes were placed on the Statute Book bearing a much closer resemblance to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
the case which we have to face here than the Electricity Bill, which, after all, dealt with a number of statutory organisations. There is a distinct difference between a statutory and a non-statutory organisation, and, although the problem of the coal mine raises the question, with which I have much sympathy, that a village might be entirely dependent upon a coal pit, and that the village people might have come there, as the hon. Member said, for the purpose of carrying on the industry there, yet, as he said, Mr. William Graham, during the passage of the Coal Mines Bill, had to resist many things which he would have liked to have seen done—not because of the pressure of a hostile majority in the House, but because of hard, economic facts which made them administratively impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I suggest that there is a difference between the two cases. The producer to whom a licence is refused for a certain piece of plant loses his capital, but the purpose of closing down that piece of plant is to improve employment, and the total volume of employment in bacon factories will be increased and not diminished; there will be a larger total through-put, though it is true that particular premises are being closed down in which a through-put is taking place. I beg my hon. Friend, however, to sympathise with me in this, that the same problems which affected the Minister in charge of the great Measure in which he was so deeply interested, and which led him to refuse suggestions that, in closing down a pit, the employés there should be compensated, apply in this case also, and, therefore, it would not be possible for me to accept such a proposal now. I think, moreover, there are principles of justice on which I could defend my action, though I do not wish to go into them too deeply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the definite line between the statutory and the non-statutory undertaking gives us our line of division between electricity and the present Measure; and it is the fact that, although you are closing down premises, and thereby making an inroad on the capital of the employer, you are not, in closing down those premises, making anything like the same inroad on the livelihood of the worker, for it is in order that employment may be maintained and ex-
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
tended that the closing down of those premises is taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major MILNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. D. Grenfell) will press this Amendment to a Division. Personally, I do not regard it as a very sound argument to say that, although this was done in the Electricity Act, it was not done in the Coal Mines Act. That is entirely beside the point, and the reasons why it was not done there are also beside the point. The question is, is it not right that a workman who, by reason of the operation of this Measure and the refusal of a licence, suffers injury for damage, should have the opportunity, just as a producer has, to put his case before an arbitration tribunal? The right hon. Gentleman talks a great deal about an employer losing his capital, but in point of fact he may be able to do all sorts of things with his capital. It may be in a form, such as buildings and machinery, in which he can utilise it for some other product, perhaps in some line of business in which the workman or employé cannot be employed because he has not the necessary experience or knowledge, and, if a man is deprived of his employment by reason of the operation of this Measure, I see no reason why he should not have an equal opportunity of going before an arbitration tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision, in its present form, providing, as it does, for the consideration of the producer's claim in the event of his being refused a licence, does not guarantee that the producer will get any compensation; that will obviously depend upon whether the arbitration tribunal is of opinion that loss has been suffered by the producer. In the same way the workman or employé will not recover any compensation unless in fact he has suffered, or is obviously going to suffer, loss, and on every principle of right and justice he has at least an equal claim in my view, and I am sure, in the view of my hon. Friend, a much greater claim, than the man who runs the risk merely of losing his capital. Personally, I do not think there can be a very great deal of risk in his case, because the premises may be used for other purposes, they may be sold, the capital may be transferred elsewhere, and so on. At any rate, the capitalist employer has the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
capital, while the poor workman very probably has none at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's Amendment indicates the essential difference between the views of hon. Gentlemen on the other side of the Committee and our views, in that one of the principles for which we stand is that the human element is at least of equal, and we would say of far greater, value than the mere material element. The right hon. Gentleman is considering here merely material loss, and is giving a right to those who may suffer such loss by reason of the refusal of a licence, whereas we are considering not only the material loss which a man may suffer, but the human loss in anxiety, in health, and in a hundred and one other considerations which in our view are of much greater importance both to the individual and to the community. I hope that my hon. Friend will insist, whether this provision appeared in previous Acts or not, on the matter going to a vote, so that a decision may be obtained upon it; and I shall be interested to see where the mem-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

With regard to the second part of my Amendment, my hon. Friends and I agree that we might properly withdraw it if the right hon.

Sub-section (4) (	<i>b</i>) does in fact apply to the second part of his Amendment, and I think, as he does, that the Amendment of my Noble Friend the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) covers the purpose which he has in mind in the first part.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "on behalf of a constituent marketing board," which are proposed to be left out by this Amendment, are likely to cause some confusion from the legal point of view, since they suggest a relation of agent and principal between the development board and the particular marketing board whose powers they are exercising. In fact, it is intended that, while the scheme will lay down the conditions on which the transferable powers may be exercised by the development board, they are, subject to these conditions, to be exercised by the development board at its own discretion and on its own responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 8, line 27, after the word "penalties," to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not exceeding five pounds for the first offence or twenty pounds for a second or subsequent offence."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is being moved on the assumption that the penalties mentioned in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) are those penalties which are set out in Sub-section (5), and which are imprisonment for a term not
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
exceeding three months or a fine not exceeding £100. It seems to those of us who are supporting this Amendment that that is far too heavy a punishment for the crimes which may be committed. The Noble Lord the Member for Perth (Lord Stone) said that some of us did not know much about farming. So far as I am concerned, that is probably true, but I know the farmer well, and he is not the best person from whom to obtain such things as estimates, returns, accounts and information. To run the risk of imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months because of clerical misdemeanours is far too heavy a penalty to put into any Statute, and it would be a reasonable thing if the Minister would accept our Amendment to limit the penalties in this case in the manner we suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The UNDER-SECRETARY of STATE for SCOTLAND (Mr. Skelton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment which the hon. Member has moved does not refer to the penalties in Sub-section (5). I rather gathered from his speech that he thought it did. The penalties mentioned in Sub-section (4) are suffered in the circumstances in which a development board has provided
	<br><blockquote><p>"for requiring holders of producers' licences to furnish to the development board, or to any person authorised by that board, such estimates, returns, accounts and other information as the development board consider necessary for the operation of the scheme; and for the imposition and recovery of penalties on and from any person who contravenes the provisions of the scheme."</p></blockquote>
That is a question, therefore, of contravention of requirements of a scheme, all the members of the scheme being subjected to penalties under that scheme. It is purely a domestic penalty. No doubt the range of penalties for not doing those things will be normally provided for in a scheme. This is not a case of a development board having a free run to oppress His Majesty's lieges all over the country as they like; it is only a domestic matter, and it is wiser to leave to the scheme itself all the details and not to interfere with what is only one particular detail in a scheme. If my hon. Friend still feels any anxiety as to the wisdom of leaving to the framers of a scheme the scale of penalties, he has to recollect that the scheme as a whole has to secure the approval of the Minister of Agriculture, and secondly has to get the approval of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
Parliament. Therefore my hon. Friend will see how limited this question is, and I ask him not to press his Amendment to a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MACLAY</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the opinion which I have received from the hon. Gentleman I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Viscount WOLMER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 8, line 29, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"() for empowering any person authorised in writing by the development board for the purpose of securing compliance with the scheme, to enter and inspect at any reasonable time and on production of his authority, any such premises in the area to which a related marketing scheme for regulating the marketing of the secondary product applies as may be specified in the authority, being premises which the development board have reason to believe are used for producing the secondary product."</p></blockquote>
I should like to thank the Minister for having intimated his willingness to accept this Amendment, and I shall therefore not keep the Committee long about it. The object is to give to the development boards the same powers as the marketing boards have under last year's Act. For instance, we have this power in the hop scheme, but we have never used it. It is an absolutely necessary power for any marketing board or any development board to have. They must know what is going on in the premises where articles for which they are responsible are being produced, and it is absolutely necessary that marketing boards or development boards should be able to guarantee the quality of the products in which they are dealing. It cannot guarantee that product unless it has the power of inspection, in order to see that its requirements and regulations are being properly carried out. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a proposal to give further powers to boards which already have power over everyone and everything. I do not think it is very convincing of the Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) to point out that they wanted further powers because marketing boards have them under the Act of last year. Some of us are very suspicious of these extra powers being conferred upon the board. Of course, the Minister is going
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
to accept the Amendment, but I think that he ought to reassure some of us who are suspicious a little better than we have been reassured by the Noble Lord who moved the Amendment. The Opposition wants some help, and they have got the Noble Lord to help them, as he did in the marketing scheme, but it seems to me rather a Socialistic measure to put into this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord SCONE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would point out that the Amendment says that admission to such an inspector is only to be at a reasonable time and upon production of his authority. That cannot be considered a Socialistic measure. I am quite sure that if producers are rigorously sticking to the terms and conditions, and are producing goods of the highest quality, they need not fear very frequent visits from the inspectors. We must have an assurance that goods are being produced of the quality and purity that they are supposed to be, and therefore this Amendment is justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just in a word, I would like to reassure the hon. and gallant Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Brown) that this is not an unreasonable proposal. In relation to the particular claim of the right hon. Gentleman the Noble Lord the Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) to speak in these matters, I would say that he has had the practical experience of working on a board, and he has given a great amount of time and attention to that service. Therefore I wish to consider very deeply any information which he brings forward, regarding the better working of these boards. Nobody could accuse him and the Noble Lard the Member for Perth (Lord Scone) of Socialistic leanings, or of a special tendency to marketing schemes, so that when they bring forward a proposal like this I think that that might reassure what I might call the right wing of the Committee. This is a power which, used with discretion, would tend to the smoother working of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOLDSWORTH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 9, line 1, to leave out from the word "to," to the word "a," in line 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very dangerous step to give the power of imprisonment. When a man has produced something which he was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
told he should not produce, although it may be a crime under this Bill, it is a very severe penalty that he should be sent to prison for three months. There is an Amendment on the Paper in the name of the hon. Member for Thirsk (Mr. Turton) which would confine the penalty to the second and subsequent offences. I feel that it is a drastic thing to say, for the first time, I think, in our legislation, that a man should go to prison for producing an article, and I want to ask the Minister whether the case could be met by the payment of a fine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is quite right in saying that this is a heavy penalty. Consider the circumstances. In Part II of the Bill we are doing what the whole Committee regard as an essential thing for the future of agriculture, in order, in regard to bacon, for instance, in which we hope to see great developments, that those developments shall be orderly and not chaotic. That is the principle on which this part of the Bill is founded, and a principle on which the House of Commons and this Committee, irrespective of party, is in agreement. What happens? When you come down to the acid test whether we can possibly secure development that will be orderly, the test will be the State's power to prevent interlopers. The interlopers will not be individual farmers, but manufacturers, seeking, without a licence, to manufacture a secondary product. We are probably not dealing with small people but with large companies, and therefore we get very easily into a region where it might be, as I hear in a whisper behind me, profitable to be fined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee and Parliament will best show their determination in this matter, and the importance they attach to orderly marketing being absolutely watertight, by leaving in this provision with regard to imprisonment. We know that the judge dealing with the matter, before imposing the penalty of imprisonment, would consider the circumstance with the very greatest care. Because this provision is in the Clause, one must not suppose that somebody who, by mistake, does something which he ought not to do under the Bill, is hauled off to prison and kept there for three months. The Committee knows very well that that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
not the kind of thing that happens. I am sure that it is wise to have the sanction of imprisonment at the back of this Clause, and I do not believe that the Committee would disagree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain TODD</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our object in putting down this Amendment was to ensure that the punishment fitted the crime. Had it been a punishment to be inflicted upon profiteers, many of us would have been glad to see boiling oil provided in the Clause. To save the time of the Committee, since the Minister has said that he is willing to consider the next Amendment, I would propose to the hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) that we ask leave to withdraw this Amendment. The next one, I think, covers our object.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. TURTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 9, line 4, after the word "or," to insert the words "in the case of a second or subsequent offence."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister may be inclined to accept this Amendment. It would be a mitigation of the penalty and would take away some of the disadvantages of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. SKELTON</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are prepared to accept the Amendment.

	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. GRENFELL</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we did not wish to take up any undue amount of time this morning, we have stated our objections to this Clause in the form of Amendments, some of which have been accepted by the Minister, while others have been turned down. Although we did not continue discussion on the Amendments, we have not exhausted the arguments that might be put forward in support of them. There are provisions in Clause 6 which do not satisfy us completely, and which will cause a good deal of apprehension to Members of all parties. We do not believe that Clause 6 gives the agricultural section what they desire or what they have been led to expect. That is their own look out. They must fight
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
their own battles. There are defects in the Clause which are serious. Although the Committee has decided that the Clause is to go through there will be an opportunity for discussion on Report and we shall exercise our right to criticise the Clause when it comes before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOLDSWORTH</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have refrained purposely from putting down Amendments in order to assist the Minister. Therefore I hope the Committee will have a little patience with me while I make a few remarks on the Clause. I am astounded to find Conservative Members handing over such wide powers as the development scheme gives to certain boards. Let us analyse the things that a development board can do. It can stop production, regulate production, buy and sell property, grant compensation, take over the powers of marketing boards, sell, insure, advertise, transport, and, finally, it can demand from any person concerned a full disclosure of his accounts. I should think this is the first time in history that such wide powers have been given to any board in regard to the manufacture of certain products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two points which I should like the Minister to consider between now and the Report stage. Under this Clause there will be some difficulty with regard to a person producing a secondary product from raw material not produced in the area of a scheme. For instance, would a development board be free to say: "Unless you buy the primary product produced in this particular area for the purpose of your secondary product, we will put you out of business"? Under the Milk Reorganisation Scheme, for instance, certain areas are defined. Would the producer of a secondary product have to purchase his primary product within a given area, or would be able to go outside the areas defined in the Milk Reorganisation Scheme. I would ask the Minister between now and the Report stage to see if something could be put into the Bill that would enable the manufacturer of a secondary product to be able to purchase not outside a marketing scheme altogether but to go into different areas for the primary products which he needs to produce his secondary products. I had intended to put down as an Amendment on this point:
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If he is a producer registered under one of the schemes regulating the marketing of a secondary product which is a constituent part of a development scheme."</p></blockquote>
Let us suppose that there are two counties, county "A" and county "B," would he be able to go to county "B" to purchase his primary product, provided that county "B" had a marketing scheme? If so, that would give him a greater range of purchase for his primary product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Sub-section (2) there is one point with which I should like to deal relating to the provision which enables a development board to buy and sell property. I may be wrong; if so I am sure the Minister will correct me. Does this provision ensure that producers will bear part of the expense of rationalising an industry in which they have no share? The producers under a marketing scheme are to form a fund out of which certain things are to be done. The primary producer has no share whatever in any of the profits that are made by the secondary producer, but if compensation is to be paid to the secondary producer, if losses are made in selling a property, then he is to put into the pool part of his resources in order to enable compensation to be paid. It seems to me that you are asking the primary producer to subsidise, or pay off, if you like, the secondary producer. I can imagine that the producer of pigs may have to bear the expense of rationalising the bacon-curing industry. If there is excessive production or there is inefficient production, and under this Clause a place is to be closed down, and the secondary producer is to be compensated, you call upon the producer of pigs to do it through the pool. Surely, you cannot say to an efficient producer of pigs that he shall bear part of the cost of compensating an inefficient producer of bacon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Sub-section (4) tremendous powers are given to the Development Board to grade, pack, store, adapt for sale, insure, advertise or transport an agricultural product. Under the principal Act of 1931 the purpose of a marketing scheme was to deal with sales, while the purpose of a development scheme is really to deal with production. Are you not delegating the powers of the Marketing Board in this particular scheme to the Development Board? It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
seems to me that you are taking away the powers of the marketing scheme and handing them over to the board. I am not certain that I understood the Amendment moved by the right hon. Gentleman this morning. Under the Bill, before we put in that Amendment the Marketing Board had to delegate their powers. Under the Amendment that will not have to be done, although I may be wrong in my interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another objection on this point is that whereas there is a consumers' committee to study the workings of the marketing board there is no provision for a consumers' committee to study the workings of a development board. If a marketing board decided that it was inconvenient to have an inquiry by a consumers' committee, they might hand over their powers of sale to a development board, which would not have to submit itself to an inquiry from the consumers' committee. I should have liked to develop that point, but time is going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that the powers granted under a development scheme regulating one product may interfere with the production of raw material which may be the raw material of numerous and other and possibly equally or more important secondary products not under a scheme. We are not certain that there will be schemes for all secondary products. Supposing one development board through their workings of marketing boards are regulating a certain kind of raw material which is the primary product for one secondary product, it will be difficult if such control interferes with another firm using that same raw material but producing another secondary product. I may not have made my points clear to the Committee but they are clear to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Conservative Members of the Committee to take note of the implications of this Clause. I do not believe that there has ever been a Bill that has so taken away the initiative of individual enterprise and handed them over to a board as this particular Clause does in regard to the development board. Are they wise in allowing this to go by without any sort of protest? Are they certain that in the future before any man is allowed to produce his secondary product, and it will even affect primary producers, that he will not have a tremend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
ous amount of obstacles put in his way? I wonder from the point of view of the country whether that is the way along which we ought to develop and whether it ought not to be a purely voluntary scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. HOROBIN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all anxious to get away to consume our quota of secondary agricultural products and I promise to be brief. This Clause is the crux of Part II of the Bill, and a simple and ingenuous person like myself finds it completely impossible to follow the subtle and tortuous minds of hon. Members like the hon. and gallant Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Clifton Brown) who are, as Conservatives, helping to put this Bill on the Statute Book. This part of the Bill starts off with a comparatively minor Clause but one which I thought would have made their hair stand on end. Under that Clause the making of an order is to be conclusive evidence that all requirements have been satisfied. When a similar provision was included in the Town Planning Act it called forth well-merited objections from constitutionalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 6 we are setting up an organisation which is, I submit, a grave danger. We have heard a great deal about the bacon industry. By this Clause we are giving very serious powers to a board with a very large official representation on it, and from that board the appeal is to the Minister. The Minister will not always be that crusted case-hardened Tory that we see in front of us; he may be somebody who in his lighter moments or in his youth has been a Socialist. That is dangerous. We may have Messrs. Chivers for instance wanting to extend their jam factory, and being told, No, the Co-operative Society makes jam and they also are considering extensions." Supposing Mr. Alexander were still in the Cabinet, would any hon. Gentleman opposite like to be a director of Messrs. Chivers, who were trying to get the right to make extensions of their factory, when it was being opposed by a co-operative application, and when he knew that it would ultimately come up for decision by the Minister? I would remind hon. Members too that if ever a Socialist Government comes into power, there will be no agreements to differ. It will be a case of strict Cabinet responsibility. I, personally, would hesitate very much as to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
the future of my industry if I were in the position of Messrs. Chivers for example, in such a case as I have described, or the bacon industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard references to sugar. There is of course, the beet sugar which is being subsidised, and there is the industry of Messrs. Tate & Lyle, which is meeting the full blast of competition. Supposing that this board decided that if there was to be any extension it would be an extension of the beet sugar industry and on my hypothesis that the rates charged were to be such as would make it economic, would Sir Alexander Lyle be hauled off to prison in order to simplify the balancing of the Budget? These things can easily be put in an amusing way but there is a serious danger involved. You are putting these matters into the power of what is, practically, a trust. It is a trust with power to prevent production, and with power to make a levy on all members of the industry efficient and inefficient together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they do make a mistake and glut the market they may borrow money upon the security of that future levy in order to have some kind of pool such as we have seen overhanging one produce market after another all over the world. When they have produced this glut and have endeavoured to stave off the evil day by levies upon producers, and still further by borrowing, and have finally got themselves into a complete mess—as every pool and trust of this sort has got into, in every country in the world—they will then send the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Minister of Agriculture off on a Border foray to the President of the Board of Trade to induce him to put on some increased quota or restriction which will have evil effects such as we all know of, upon the export trade of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I view with grave anxiety this reversion to the unsound enthusiasms of the right hon. and gallant Gentleman's youth. I think he would be wise to reconsider the matter. I assume, though I may be wrong, that this board would not have any power to interfere with the imports of products. I do not think that such is the intention but the wording of the relevant Sub-section, which refers back in the usual confusing way to the Agricultural Marketing Act, leaves one in doubt.
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
That, of course, would make matters worse, but I do not stress that point, and I hope it is not the case that the board is to have such powers. There is quite enough to be said against this experiment without basing oneself upon that ground. One cannot possibly vote against this part of the Bill, because the Minister assures us that it is an essential part of his scheme. But how on earth a real dyed-in-the-wool, true blue Tory can vote for it, is beyond me. The only way to save this country from being turned into a Socialist state is to have another Socialist Government. They never would have the ingenuity or the febrile energy of my right hon. and gallant Friend to do anything so dangerous and original as to introduce Socialism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major MILNER</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist the temptation to say a word or two. The two previous speakers and particularly the hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holdsworth) appear to want the best of both worlds. They have supported this Bill through thick and thin. At any rate their voices have been raised on very few occasions in very feeble protests. Now they are using language which would indicate that they are opposed to almost every item in the Bill. No doubt, when the next election comes—and we understand it is not going to be very long in coming—they will claim credit for having opposed the conferment of the enormous powers proposed by this Bill. The hon. Member for South Bradford gave us a typical example of Liberal tactics. I am not sure of the political complexion of the hon.

One knows, however, that independents have little or no influence in these matters, and I do not think the Committee need pay very great regard to his comments, particularly on the last Labour Government which showed his ignorance of the efforts made by that Government—efforts in which they were hampered by many factors and not least by the difficulties which they had with the Liberal party. I agree with the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. D. Grenfell) that it would be ungenerous to divide against this Clause.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1932-1933V000P2I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
The right hon. and gallant Gentleman has gone so far in our direction that we ought to acknowledge it frankly and freely. Personally, I am going to keep on friendly terms with him, in view of the revolution which we understand is going to take place later on this year, on India or on these trade agreements, or on something of the sort. There are more unlikely thing than the right hon. and gallant Gentleman may play an important part because he has such experience in these matters of Socialist policy. I do not wish the Committee to understand that I regard him as a Socialist. He is a sort of semi-Socialist in Tory trousers. At the moment he is—let us admit it, as I am sure he would—a semi-Socialist by force of circumstances. He has had to recognise that only Socialist measures, however halfheartedly it may be his policy to apply them, are adequate to the new situation not only in agriculture but in the whole industry of the country to-day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the right hon. and gallant Gentleman on his courage in admitting that fact and taking such prompt and effective steps in the Socialist direction. I can only marvel, however, at the way in which the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Clifton Brown) and other hon. Gentlemen opposite have allowed themselves to be dragooned. They have put down Amendments and have made feeble protests like those of a child who is asked to take some unpleasant medicine. With a little wriggle they have swallowed the medicine holus-bolus. I see the hon. and gallant Member for Louth (Lieut.-Colonel Heneage) in his place. There was no one more vociferous than he during the passage of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931. On this occasion he has said nothing, but has swallowed every morsel put before him by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman. We had an illuminating speech from the hon. Member for Stone (Sir J. Lamb) who replied to the question "what is excessive production by saying that production was excessive when it was in excess of consumption. But the question is what is consumption? Does he refer to the present actual consumption or to the possible, future and prospective consumption?

In our view, while there are good points in the Clause and in the Bill generally, so far as many of the restrictions are concerned we think that the Government are starting at the wrong end. They are trying to restrict production instead of trying to expand consumption, as we should do contemporaneously. That is the difference of principle between ourselves and the Government. I do not desire to take up any more time. We are thankful for small mercies, and we do not propose, while reserving all our rights, to divide against the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that it would be discourteous if I did not say three words before we adjourn to discuss the vexed question of what is consumption. I am sure we all realise that, whatever consumption is, we know what it is not, and that is when you have stuff Left on the plate. All over Britain now, there are masses of goods being left on the plate, and, as long as that is so, we shall never be able to get agriculture into a healthy condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Gentleman threw several flies over the Committee in order to try to get them to rise against the Bill. That is a well-known device of the Opposition to-day, and I take no exception to it. I and my hon. Friend are willing to go a very long way in order to get the key of our own house into our own pocket. That will be possible under this Bill, and we do not intend it to be jeopardised by any dissentions within our own ranks. The hon. Member for South Bradford (Mr. Holds-worth) put to me three or four questions, but I think it would be better that I should not at this time try to go into them at length. I will write to him in full upon them, and, if he is not satisfied with the explanation, he can, of course, raise them again on a later Clause, or when we reach the Report stage.

The hon. Member for Central Southwark (Mr. Horobin) was, as always, brilliant and delightful, but his opposition to this Clause, surely, is simply opposition to organisation as a whole. None of us like organisation. I myself detest having to catch a train in the morning. If I could only walk down to the station and blow a whistle and start the train

myself, how much simpler it would be. But, unfortunately, in our modern life, we have to fall in with the wishes of other people if we want to go anywhere. It is very disagreeable, and it is a thing to which I, as an agriculturalist and an individual, am heartily opposed; but the whole of Clause 6 simply says that there is a necessity for greater organisation. We are anchoring that to the consent of the producer, we are buttressing it by affirmative Resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, and, if all these people are at one, we believe they should be given the powers which are set out in skeleton form in Clause 6. That is our only justification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>—(Secondary products to which Part II of the Act applies.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. CHRISTIE</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 9, line 13, to leave out from the word "are," to the word "wholly," in line 14, and to insert instead thereof the word "products."

In Clause 25, a secondary product is defined as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The secondary product means, in relation to a development scheme, the agricultural product for organising the production of which provision is made by that scheme."</p></blockquote>
We want to know why, in view of that apparently sufficient definition, it is necessary to put in the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"bacon (including hams) and any such agricultural product."</p></blockquote>
We are generally told on these occasions that it is a great mistake to mention individual things in a Clause, because it is very often held by lawyers afterwards that the Clause does not apply to
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
things which are not mentioned. We are being told that the Danish producer now cuts pieces from sides of an inferior nature and sends them here in pickled form, and, if these words are included, it might be said that the Clause would not apply to such things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major ELLIOT</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can satisfy my hon. Friend in one sentence. As the Clause is now drafted, it is competent for the industry, as soon as the Bill becomes law, to proceed forthwith to submit a development scheme for bacon. In the case of other products, an Order will need to be laid before the House before a scheme can even be submitted. This, therefore, short-circuits one stage in the control of the bacon industry, but we were able to do that because the scheme had proceeded far before the Bill was introduced, and it is only for that reason that we name bacon here, and thereby save a little stage in the time-table of bringing into force the Bacon Scheme, which, in view of our desire to get it into force by July, is very necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General BROWN</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be very careful that this does not upset future schemes.
