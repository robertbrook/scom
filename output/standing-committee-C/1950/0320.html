	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for War (Mr. Michael Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, " That the Committee at its rising this day do adjourn until Tuesday, 10th April, at 11 o'Clock."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made good progress on the Bill so far, and it is even possible that we may finish it this morning, but it would be wise to take this precaution in case we do not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no objection to that.

	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(SUSPENSION OF DEATH SENTENCES.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed. "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the course of the discussion on an Amendment to the Clause, you indicated, Mr. JoynsonHicks, that you thought that what my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Merton and Morden (Captain Ryder) was saying might more appropriately be said on this Motion. I do not wish to take up much time in debating the matter, but I should like to hear the reasons for limiting the proviso in Clause 14 to Army and Air Force courts-martial. Some sort of provision may prove to be necessary in relation to the Royal Navy in another war. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty will know, we may have ships isolated from anywhere else, serving on their own thousands of miles away, which may require to have a court-martial, and because of the exigencies of that service some provision of this character may be needed. If the proviso is not extended in some form to the Royal Navy,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1244</span>
I fear that it may be found in practice that the omission to extend the proviso to the Royal Navy causes difficulties. I ask the hon. Gentleman to give consideration to the further extension of the proviso, and, if he is opposed to doing that, to put before us cogent reasons for its limitation solely to Army and Air Force courts-martial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty (Mr. Callaghan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may answer that immediately. I am sure we are glad to see the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Manningham-Buller), here on this first ocasion. I can assure him that if he comports himself as his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) has done we shall get on extraordinarily well in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why the Admiralty have not asked for this provision is that we think that the occasions on which it will be used will be so rare that we do not wish to place more powers in the hands of those who carry out this extremely onerous task than we can help. During the last 100 years only one death sentence has been carried out after a naval court-martial. I suppose the most famous case was that of Admiral Byng, but that was nearly 200 years ago. Fortunately these things do not happen very often, and, as this has happened on so few occasions. we prefer .that where punishment of death is to be inflicted on a prisoner the matter should be remitted to the Admiralty first for consideration. The practical consequences of that have not proved to be onerous during a very long history in the Navy, and as they have not proved onerous in the past I doubt whether they will prove any more onerous in the future. We prefer not to ask the Committee for these powers, which I gather the Opposition are exploring to see whether they may be willing to confer them upon us. In the circumstances we prefer not to have them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested by what the hon. Gentleman has said. At the same time, I should like him to say that he will give the matter further consideration. He has advanced an argument based upon what has happened in the past. That carries a certain amount of weight, but no-one can foretell what conditions will be in the future.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
I entirely agree that the power would be very sparingly used and used only in exceptional circumstances. I should not for a moment like to suggest that the power should be in any way a general power, but, in the light of evidence given before an inquiry, I should have thought that it would have been to the advantage of the Navy, as it has been shown to be to the Army and the Air Force, should wholly exceptional circumstances arise, to be able to make use of a provision of this character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will put it another way. If the situation was quite different in the next war from what it has been in the last 100 years, and if the need really arose upon the spot for doing something promptly when it might not be easy to get in touch with the Admiralty, a very awkward situation might arise unless the commander on the spot had powers of the sort which in similar circumstances will be exercisable by commanders in the Royal Air Force and the Army. I do not in the least wish to force on the Admiralty something they do not desire, but I look at it from the, practical angle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power is wanted in the Army and the Air Force only for purely exceptional circumstances where it is not possible for the local commander to get in touch with the authorities with whom he would normally communicate. It may be that communications break down more easily in the Army and Air Force than in the Navy, but one does not know. In another war communications in the Navy may prove extremely difficult for one reason or another. I ask the hon. Gentleman to say that he will reconsider the matter, not because we want to foist on the Navy something they do not want, but because it would surely be a convenience not to have to come back to amend the Bill in order to secure some such power for the Admiralty if an emergency arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the argument, which I do not want to press unduly, that there is something to be said for uniformity within the three Services where it can be secured. I do not attach much weight to that, but it is unfortunate when we are trying to set up a court and a code common to all three Services in some respects that we should have a difference between two Services on the one side and one Service on the other in this matter.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1246</span>
I do not put that forward as a very strong argument, but the other argument is one to which some weight should be given, because we cannot judge the future with any great assurance in the light of the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Callaghan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of the arguments which the hon. and learned Gentleman has advanced I cannot undertake to reconsider the matter. I also attach very little weight to uniformity in a matter of this sort. I am all for our not being uniform except where there is a strong case for uniformity. Although it might be tidier for the drafting of the Bill if the three Services were uniform in this respect, there is not much in it from the uniformity point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to use in a future war, I agree with the last remark by the hon. and learned Gentleman. I cannot look ahead, but I have tried to project my imagination into the future, and I do not know of any circumstances which would lead me to feel that the whole discipline of a unit or ship would break down unless the commanding officer had these powers. Aboard the ship he has cells in the fore-peak, and they could be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not every ship, and certainly not the smaller ships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Callaghan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, but it is not impossible to devise ways and means of incarcerating those who are subject to the supreme penalty. This is a power that we should not lightly let go. The hon. and learned Gentleman has not been able to adduce any illustrations of circumstances in which we should need the power. I find myself in the curious position of resisting a power which he is offering me. The converse is usually the case. We are usually asking the Committee to give us powers which the Opposition do not want us to have. Perhaps the Naval Discipline Act will have to be amended in due course. If there is anything in this matter when that amendment comes along, we may consider it then, but at the moment, on the basis of past experience and future expectation, I cannot undertake to look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier Prior-Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman to look at this from another angle, although I do not wish to get my feet wet? What harm can be done
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>
by the Admiralty having this power? What is the objection, apart from the fact that there is a dislike of doing anything that the Army does? Is there any objection apart from that? if there is no valid objection, it is better to have the power in case it is required. A point which the hon. Gentleman did not mention is that in the last 100 years we have not had the extremely efficient wireless communication system which the Navy has now. That is a point in the hon. Gentleman's favour, but, even so, I still think that, unless there is a really sound objection, it would be well to have the power in case it is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary invited us to suggest cases which might arise. On balance, I am in favour of the Admiralty retaining complete control over this matter. I only want to be convinced that we shall not be faced with very difficult circumstances if the Admiralty does not have this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should consider the position of naval ratings serving on combined operations where they mix completely with the Army. In a case like the fall of Singapore one may have naval ratings serving ashore under the Naval Discipline Act alongside soldiers. Ratings and soldiers may be accused of the same offence but will have to be tried under a different system of law. Can I be assured that, if the remedy is not to be found in amendment of the Bill, some other remedy will be found to ensure a degree of uniformity in covering such cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Callaghan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The line I should take in reply to the hon. and gallant Member for Worthing (Brigadier Prior-Palmer) is that I do not want powers unless they can be shown to be necessary. It is a bad principle to take wider powers than one needs unless one really may want them. That is an argument which I have heard more often from the other side of the Committee than from this. Perhaps both sides learn by experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the remarks of the hon. and gallant Member for Merton and Morden (Captain Ryder), I should have thought that the experience of the last war was a sufficient test of the adequacy of present arrangements. We had so many men serving in naval air stations, in Combined Operations and on shore, that at one time
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
I suppose, we had more men on shore than afloat and the existing powers proved utterly satisfactory. I feel in a case like this, unless there is overwhelming argument to be adduced to the contrary power should be given to the Admiralty to review these matters in all circumstances. I do not wish to depart from that, and I do not think reasons of discipline, the experience of the past and the possibilities of the future would lead me to recommend the Committee to give these powers, which we do not really need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary has sought on two occasions to bring a party atmosphere into our discussions on this Bill, which we are trying to make as good a Bill as possible. It is only for that reason that I rise to ventilate the subject. I agree with my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Merton and Morden (Captain Ryder) that in the past in the majority of cases it was right that the Admiralty should have complete control. No one dissents from that proposition. It is merely the suggestion that the Admiralty should have the power themselves to delegate authority in exceptional cases that is at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like people taking wider powers than are required, but, speaking for myself, I am not entirely convinced by the hon. Gentleman's arguments that the power which the Army and the Air Force think they may require in the future, in exceptional cases, will not in the future prove to be required, in exceptional circumstances, by the Admiralty. That is all the issue that is raised here. We might get two ships serving together, isolated, far distant from the Admiralty, perhaps with communications cut off, and in such circumstances I would have thought that the existence of this power would have been desirable. It is for that reason that I ask the hon. Gentleman to give further consideration to the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to press the Parliamentary Secretary unduly upon it. Is he really putting it forward as a tenable proposition that in two small ships serving in far distant waters, it is possible to keep men in cells on those ships? He knows that many of those ships have not got cells. Does he think it would be good for discipline to keep a man, perhaps for a long period of time, confined on one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1249</span>
of these small vessels which have not any cells? Does he think that that will be in the interests of justice? I am not going to ask the hon. Gentleman to reply now, but I put this forward in all seriousness to try to make this an even better Bill. I think he has dealt with the subject unduly lightly, and all I am asking him to do is to give further consideration to it between now and the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(PERSON NOT TO BE TRIED AGAIN WHERE CONVICTION IS QUASHED.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hylton-Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 11, line 17, to leave out "for that offence" and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"upon the same facts."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is designed to attract the Committee's attention to what we think is a difficult matter. I am not seriously wedded to the precise words if the Committee and the Lord Advocate have in mind some other form which would obtain the object in hand. The Clause, as it stands, appears to be designed so that someone who has been successful in an appeal shall not be tried again for that offence before another court. Supposing he were to be tried again for that offence, I cannot imagine if he was properly defended, for instance, by such a doughty fighter as the hon. and gallant Member for Aberdeenshire, East—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is "hon. and learned." He would not answer to "gallant."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate (Mr. John Wheatley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His constituency is Aberdeen, North. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Boothby) engages in guerrilla warfare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hylton-Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise to the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes). I do not desire to bog down my submissions to the Committee with apologies to the hon. and learned Gentleman for my errors, even
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
though I have not as yet got his attention. The Clause as it stands unamended does not seem to be necessary at all as far as one can see, because an accused tried for a particular offence, in respect of which a conviction has already been quashed, would have a perfectly sound plea in 	<i>autrefois acquit</i>.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I would submit to the Committee the desirability of protecting such persons against the ingenious savagery of lawyers, who would desire upon the same facts to frame an alternative charge that might appear to be a different offence. Obviously no one would desire to sound a plea of 	<i>autrefois acquit</i> and to avoid following such matters as that. If the precise form of words we propose to insert are not the right ones, I would be interested to hear if the Lord Advocate could introduce any other form of words which might attain our object, but the submission I make to the Committee is that, as the Clause stands, it is not necessary, and if this Amendment, or something on those lines, were incorporated full protection for the appellant would be secured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for York (Mr. Hylton-Foster) was that the Clause is not necessary. The reason for its inclusion is that it forms part of the pattern of this procedure, and provides, in the event of a conviction "by court-martial being quashed, that the accused person shall not be liable to be tried again for the same offence by court-martial or any other court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the previous part of the machinery we find that statutory provision is already made for this plea of 	<i>autrefois acquit</i> in relation to an actual court-martial itself. The Committee will recollect that the position is that on trial by court-martial 	<i>autrefois acquit</i> by another court may be pleaded. That is provided for in Section 157 of the Army Act, and Rule of Procedure No. 36. On the other hand, on a trial by court-martial 	<i>autrefois acquit</i> by a competent civil court may be pleaded. That is provided in the Army Act, Section 162 (6), and Rule of Procedure No. 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversely, on a trial by a civilian court 	<i>autrefois acquit</i> by court-martial cannot be pleaded, and we find that in Section 41 	<i>(a)</i> and 162 of the Army Act.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
Therefore, within the code we already have a statutory provision for this plea, and since we are now setting up an appeal court it seems reasonable, having regard to that background, that we should also make statutory provision for this plea of 	<i>autrefois convict</i> in relation to this appeal court. I think that disposes of the argument on the ground that it is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that there is some misapprehension on the second argument that the Clause as it stands fails to give protection to the accused men. Manifestly, this is one of the cases where we like to have uniformity—a uniformity between the civil criminal law and the military criminal law. I gather that some misapprehension may have arisen by a passage in Archbold's Criminal Law, which deals with this question. The learned author, considering the fact that under Section 33 of the Interpretation Act, 1899, these words are used:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The offender shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence"</p></blockquote>
suggests that Section 33 of the Interpretation Act would have been clearer if for the word "offence" there were substituted the words "act or omission." That, in fact, is what is proposed by this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That suggestion by the learned author of Archbold's Criminal Law was expressly disapproved by Mr. Justice Humphreys in the recent case of Rex v. Thomas, which is reported in 1950 I King's Bench, and there the learned Judge said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not the law that a person shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same act. It has never been so held in any case, and it is not so provided in the Interpretation Act."</p></blockquote>
In those circumstances, we get back to what is the common law in relation to this particular plea. The common law is that a person should not be put twice on trial and be convicted for the same offence, and there is plenty of authority for that proposition. That being the common law, we merely wish to retain it in relation to the plea as affected by the actions of this new appeal court. Manifestly, it would be very invidious indeed if we accepted a form of words which might result in the interpretation of the law being different for this form of procedure than it would be in the civil-criminal courts. For these reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise full well that the Lord Advocate when dealing with English law is, if I may use the expression, playing away from home. At the same time, I am sure the Committee are most grateful to him for the clear answer he has given to this Amendment. I am not convinced that this Clause is at all necessary in view of what he said. If the original conviction is quashed by the Court of Appeal, the existing statutory provision would come into play, and the plea of 	<i>autrefois acquit</i> would, no doubt, be raised by the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) if there were the slightest possibility of doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to come to what I think is a more serious part of this Amendment. On this occasion it is not without interest to find that the Lord Advocate is using the argument of uniformity which was resisted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty a little time ago. However, I pass from that. What one is a little worried about is the possibility of a man being brought before a court-martial, for instance, and tried for obtaining money by false pretences and, after the delays that take place—and they do take place —being kept, perhaps in open arrest, for a considerable time, convicted by that court-martial, the conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal and then being brought back and tried on the same facts for fraudulent conversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conditions are not quite the same in military law as they are in civil law. I quite agree that in the ordinary courts of this country it would be indeed astonishing if, after a conviction for false pretences had been quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, that man was, on the same facts, indicted for fraudulent conversion. But I am not at all sure that it would not be desirable to insert in this Bill some safeguard against the possibility of that happening in some remote part of the world where a unit was acting in a great deal of isolation and where the unit learned, for instance, that the conviction had been quashed by the Court of Appeal and some smart man thought, "Now let us see if we can get him on the other leg and go for him for fraudulent conversion." I am not sure that that is adequately covered here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
It may be that sufficient provision would be made and that there is sufficient guidance in the Manual of Military Law and the Manual of Air Force Law, and sufficient indication of what the practice should be. But in war-time, as we all knew, it was one of the matters of the greatest difficulty for anyone who had to use that book to get hold of any copy at all, and even more difficult to get a copy which was in any respect up-to-date. While I appreciate the uniformity argument with regard to the civil law, I do think it important that if possible some steps should be taken to prevent a man being put on trial twice, unless there are exceptional circumstances, on the same facts, when there is not very much difference between the nature of the offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. L. M. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the arguments put forward from both sides of the Committee. It is quite clear that both sides are anxious to see that no man should be subjected to a double trial or further trials on the same facts. As the intention is abundantly clear, I should have dealt with the Clause in this way. I should have had Clause 16 reading as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the conviction of a person by court-martial for an offence has been quashed under this Part of this Act, he shall not be liable to be tried again for that or any other offence upon the same facts by a court-martial or by any other court."</p></blockquote>
I think that would clear the intention which the Lord Advocate has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is the exact opposite of what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But quite clearly, if we are anxious that the man should not be in peril on a subsequent occasion for an offence based on certain facts which are indisputable, the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"tried again for that or any other offence upon the same facts"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we all welcome the hon. Member's effort to improve our drafting, but, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for York (Mr. Hylton-Foster) said in moving the Amendment, we are not so concerned about the drafting as the spirit behind the Amendment. If the hon. Member thinks he is supporting the Lord Advocate by what he is saying, I am afraid
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>

It seems fundamental to British justice as we have known it that once a man is acquitted on certain facts he should not be subject to a further trial on the same set of facts. It is true, as has been said, that where a charge is submitted under the Larceny Act a person can be convicted on alternate charges and, assuming he is convicted for larceny by a court-martial and then goes to the Court-Martial Appeal Tribunal and the appeal is allowed, if the facts show that the man has been guilty of false pretences it is possible, in my view, for another charge to be levelled against that man.

consider whether there is the slightest parallel between Mr. Justice Humphreys in Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas and the question of a retrial after a quashing on appeal. It is, in my submission, for the Lord Advocate's consideration, quite a different one. I hope he will not rely on Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas in considering the suggestion of his hon. Friend the Member for Ardwick (Mr. L. M. Lever).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from departing from Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas, I am going to refer the Committee back to it, because I think it illustrates very clearly the reason for having this Clause in its present form. I do not want to try to score debating points about consistency and uniformity. Each side of the Committee can use that argument very effectively. While discussing the last Clause the hon. and learned Member for Northants, South (Mr. Manningham-Buller) wanted uniformity and now he wants to get away from it. At the same time, the hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that I had been using the argument of uniformity which had been resisted by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty. I hope we can get away from these debating points and get down to the substance of the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that in England and Scotland and among the Army, Air Force and Naval authorities, normally from the administrative point of view, there would not be any tendency to charge a person for a different offence arising out of the same facts had he been acquitted or convicted of another offence. But the reason why we want to keep this on all fours with the civil-criminal law is that circumstances might arise when it would be manifestly desirable in the interests of justice to be able to charge a person with another offence arising out of the same facts. I think the best illustration I can give is the case of Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas. That was a case where a person had been convicted of wounding with intent to murder his wife, and he was convicted and sent to seven years penal servitude. Subsequent to that his wife died, which of course altered the whole nature of the offence, and he was thereupon charged with murder, and his counsel tabled a plea of 	<i>autrefois convict</i>. It was in those. circumstances that the learned judge, Mr. Justice Humphreys, gave expression to the views I have already indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
It is easy for the hon. and learned Gentleman to quote the case of the person who was charged with stealing and subsequently might be charged with fraudulent conversion, but it is equally easy for me to quote the type of case of Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas on the other hand. It seems to me this is a type of case where we are better to run on parallel lines with the civil-criminal law, leaving it to the wise judgment and discretion of the administrators to determine in what exceptional circumstances a person would be charged with another offence arising out of the same facts after he had been acquitted of the original offence. But to deprive the authorities of the right under any circumstances of charging him with the subsequent offence when circumstances might arise in which it would be manifestly contrary to the principles of justice that that person should go free, or merely be visited with a very minor punishment, in respect of facts which turn out to be much more serious eventually than were at first envisaged, would be to impose too great a restriction. I think the hon. and learned Gentleman indicated in an earlier speech that as long as wise administration was exercised in relation to these matters he would be satisfied and I ask the Committee also to be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to pursue the matter a little further, but it is an important matter and I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say there is not the disagreement that there appeared, having regard to the subsequent explanation by the Lord Advocate of the circumstances in which a person charged and convicted of a minor offence might get away with a more serious offence according to the principles of law as they exist.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that a new light has dawned on the mind of the hon. Gentleman.

learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) were a Member of this Committee and were present he would be able to advance very cogent arguments, as he did on a previous occasion on this point. Which way those arguments would sway the Committee I am not sure, but I have no doubt that he would be able to speak with a good deal of knowledge on this subject—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He argued unsuccessfully on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it was unsuccessfully argued on that occasion, but that is by the way. Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas was a case where a man had been convicted of a minor offence and then charged and convicted of murder. That is one thing, but under this Bill it will be a first conviction which is quashed by the appellant tribunal; the first conviction in Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas was not quashed. Here the matter will have been taken right up, it may be, to the House of Lords and finally the conviction has been quashed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the right hon. and learned Gentleman says that even though that happens, even though a conviction by court-martial is ultimately quashed in the House of Lords, he wants to retain power to try that man by court-martial again upon the very same facts for a slightly different offence. As I understand it, that is what the Lord Advocate maintains should be done. It is said that it is a power which will be exercised, if things work out as they should, only in the most exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it suggested that the decision in Rex 	<i>v</i>.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will argue the case of Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas with the Lord Advocate at any time he likes, and I will get the hon. and learned Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget) to assist me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Slater</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not got into court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is just what I was about to say to the Lord Advocate. I want to come back to the argument from which the last interruption may appear to have diverted attention. Is it right if a case has been taken,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1258</span>
it may be to the House of Lords, and the result has been an acquittal, that after that acquittal the man can be put in peril again for a slightly different offence upon precisely the same facts? That is the question which arises. The Lord Advocate says that we must have this power in exceptional cases. There is force in that argument. He says that we can rely upon that not happening except where it is absolutely warranted. Frankly, I am not so happy about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we get isolated units far removed from control, or in the tangle which happens on occasions, we may easily find a man charged when the Lord Advocate might say, "This man ought not to be put in peril again." Once the man is charged and brought within the ambit of the machine, it may not be easy to get him discharged on that particular count, when one bears in mind that if the Clause is not amended, then obviously the person who has charged him with the other offence is acting within the law in so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this is not an easy problem. I ask the Lord Advocate to say that he will look at the matter again with a view to seeing whether we cannot adopt some other form of wording which will achieve the object which I think everyone in this Committee wants to achieve. That object is to prevent men being put in peril twice on the same facts when really it would be wrong that they should be so treated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It occurs to me that in his second trial Mr. Thomas was not tried upon the same facts. The very significant difference between the first trial and the second trial was that in the meantime Mrs. Thomas had died. Even if our Amendment was adopted, or some similar words were incorporated, it would not prevent military authorities from doing what the civil-criminal authorities did to Mr. Thomas. They could take note of a new fact—the death of the wife—and try the man again on very much the same facts but with the new and important fact of the death of the wife. The case of Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas is not altogether a case in point since, in any event, whether the Amendment were made or not, I suggest that it would be outside the scope of this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point which I think worthy of consideration is that, in his criticism in that case of the statement in

Archbold, Mr. Justice Humphreys did not comment upon the desirability of the state of affairs which the learned editor of Archbold had suggested, but merely said that it is not the law. That should be a perfectly sound argument in a criminal court, but it is not a very sound argument here. There are occasions when, particularly in new circumstances, this' Committee, and Parliament of which it forms part, has to consider not what the law is but what the law ought to be, and this could be one of those cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Higgs) is wrong in his analysis of the situation in Rex 	<i>v</i>. Thomas. The facts were exactly the same; the result was different. In criminal law the determining factor of a person's responsibility is his act. The result of his acts may determine the nature of the charge, and the nature of the punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And his intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And his intention. His intention may be deemed from the nature of his acts. We do not want to get into a discussion on criminal law. The facts were exactly the same. What determines the nature of the charge, and possibly the nature of the punishment, is the result flowing from those acts. I must tell the hon. and learned Member for Northants, South (Mr. ManninghamBuller) that I do not think that I can give an undertaking to look at this matter again, because of the repercussions it might have on the civil-criminal law. We have here a well recognised code. We have a code of civil law which is perfectly well understood and which is properly applicable in these cases. If we introduced this Amendment it would throw doubt on the law in the other sphere. We are convinced that if it was necessary to do that we should be justified in accepting the Amendment. Having regard to the fact that the principle in civil-criminal law has stood the test of time, we think we are perfectly entitled to incorporate it in this Bill. I cannot give an undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"a naval court-martial, it shall be the duty of the Admiralty."</p></blockquote>
This and the next four Amendments are slightly more than drafting Amendments, but perhaps it would be convenient to discuss them together. It would be useful if I read out the subsection as it would appear if the Amendments were made. It would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of every appeal, or application for leave to appeal, under this Part of this Act to the Court against a conviction by a naval court-martial, it shall be the duty of the Admiralty to furnish to the registrar, in accordance with rules of court, the proceedings of the court-martial and in the case of every such appeal or application for leave to appeal as aforesaid against a conviction by an army or air force court-martial, it shall be the duty of the Judge Advocate General to furnish to the registrar, in accordance with rules of court, the proceedings of the court-martial (including any proceedings with respect to the revision of the finding or sentence of the court-martial in pursuance of subsection (2) of section fifty-four of the Army Act or subsection (2) of section fifty-four of the Air Force Act, as the case may be) and the proceedings with respect to the confirmation of the finding and sentence of the court-martial."</p></blockquote>
The effect of the Clause, as amended, would be that there would be forwarded to the Court the proceedings of the court-martial. The word "original" is left out as being unnecessary. Together with the proceedings of the court-martial in the case of Army or Air Force courts-martial, there shall be sent any proceedings with respect to confirmation. That does not apply to Naval courts-martial. Another effect of the Amendments is to arrange more tidily the distinction between Naval courts-martial and those of the other Services. There would also be forwarded to the Court proceedings in respect of revision of finding of sentence, in accordance with Section 54 of the Army and Air Force Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original Clause used the word "revision" which might, without the precise definition which we are now giving, have been taken to mean consideration of such a matter as mitigation of sentence, by the Army Council, the Air Council, or the Admiralty. Clearly, it would not be the intention, nor would it be desirable, to have discussions on that kind of

	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
issue forwarded to the court. The effect of the Amendment is to rule out discussions of that kind and to confine what should be sent to the proceedings of the court-martial on confirmation, in those circumstances where confirmation occurs, and proceedings on revision in the strict sense of the word under Section 54 of the relevant Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

This is an important Amendment, though I need not take up much time since there is agreement on it, and as a result of what was said during the Second Reading the Committee are familiar with the issue involved. I think it was common ground that it was desirable that as I believe in a civil case the opinion of the trial judge may be before the Court of Criminal Appeal, so there should be a comparable provision here. But, of course, to provide that the opinions of the Judge Advocate of the Fleet or of the Judge Advocate General should be before
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
the Court is a very different matter, and that was considered on Second Reading. It was urged by the Opposition and accepted by the Government that that was undesirable. Therefore, we are moving this Amendment to delete this paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to what took place on Second Reading. Perhaps he would be more accurate in saying that attention was first drawn to these particular provisions by hon. Members on this side in the House. After all, these words which are now considered unnecessary were in the Bill originally introduced by the Minister of Defence, supported by the Secretary of State for War, the Attorney-General, the Secretary of State for Air and the Lord Advocate—and we must not forget the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty. I should not like him to think he was overlooked in any connection. I think he can be relied upon to see that that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably they all carefully considered the Bill before it was introduced, and we find the Bill was introduced with these lines which it is now proposed to leave out. We drew attention to the matter very strongly in the course of the Second Reading. I recognise that when attention was drawn to it, the attitude of the Government to our observations was not so hostile as is somewhat customary in these days. Therefore, I was not in the least surprised to find the name of the Minister of Defence put above my name and the names of my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee to this particular Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the deletion of these words is an improvement of the Bill, and I am surprised that in spite of the careful consideration given to the Bill before it was presented to the House by the Lord Advocate and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty that we should have had to spend time in discussing these particular lines. If they had exercised their influence and secured the omission of these words from the Bill before it was tabled some time might have been saved on Second Reading and in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier Prior-Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 12, line 11, to leave out "any," and insert "each."
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
We regard this as quite an important Amendment and we have tabled it in order that the Clause should follow established principles of courts-martial in general. We are not sure why this Clause should depart from the principle that each and every member of the court is required to give his opinion both on the finding and on the sentence. In fairness to the accused, if a report is required it should be obtained from all members of the court and not from one individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the further point that this practice will act as a deterrent, if such a deterrent is necessary, to a president of a court-martial attempting to exert influence on a junior member of the court. I regret to say it has been known to happen in the past, though not very often, and a report that this had occurred might well come out at a later stage as a result of procuring opinion from each and every. member of the court on any point that arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Clause is framed at present it would be quite possible for the rules of court to provide for the opinion of each and every member of the court to be obtained. But the effect or purpose of the Amendment is to make it essential that that should be so. We feel it is not desirable, for these reasons. It might well be that owing to the exigencies of service, or owing to the fact that a member of the court was dead or was at the other end of the world it would not be practicable to obtain a report from that particular member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we made mandatory that a report should be obtained from him the appeal would be held up pending receipt of that report. Naturally, it could not be obtained in the event of the member having died in the interval. As the Clause is framed at present it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rules of court may make provision—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<i>(b)</i> for requiring the Admiralty or the Judge Advocate General to procure from any member of the court-martial —."</p></blockquote>
and that would enable them to obtain opinion from each member of the court or each member who was available. On the other hand, it may be only necessary to obtain a report from the president of the court. That is not unknown in the civil-criminal sphere where a report is obtained from the chairman of quarter sessions; and, of course, the facts in the report which might be of interest may vary considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
Hon. Members who have experience of these matters know that facts in a report can vary considerably, but to tie the rules down to provide that a report shall be obtained from each and every member of the court would be far too restrictive and might hold up the machinery of the law and delay a hearing of an appeal quite unnecessarily. Having regard to the fact that that power is already there—if it is desired to exercise it—to obtain a report from each and every one, I think it would be better to leave the Clause as it stands and not to import into it this obligation which might prove a great burden and hardship, particularly to the accused person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely satisfied by the Lord Advocate's reply. The analogy he sought to draw between reports by chairmen of quarter sessions and presidents of courts-martial is not at all a correct one. I have not had the advantage of seeing reports sent in by chairmen of quarter sessions but I should imagine they deal primarily with matters that affect sentence and not any other question. That is one thing, but reports which can be called for here from courts-martial are not limited to matters that affect sentence. If they were limited to matters which affect sentence they would not be matters with which it would be pertinent for the court to deal, because the Court of Appeal will not be dealing with sentence. Therefore, in considering whether it should be retained in its present form in the Bill, one has to look further to see for what purpose this power is wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no objection to the power to call for a report from the Judge Advocate. There it is one individual, not a member of the court in a strict sense, who can be called upon by the Court of Appeal for a report as to particular items. But when one comes to say—and the Lord Advocate has said it quite clearly—that all that may be necessary is to obtain a report from the president of the court-martial and not any other member, that is just the very thing which disturbs me very much, for this reason. The sort of matter on which I imagine the Court of Appeal might require a report would be as to whether or not something improper had happened in closed court considering verdict but not sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give an illustration, there might be a suggestion that one member of the court
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1265</span>
had told other members in closed court what he knew of the accused's previous convictions. There might well be a requirement for a report on that matter. Another possibility is a leakage of information after the conclusion of the trial. That is not uncommon even in the highest circles, and I do not mean only military or legal circles. A suggestion might be put forward by the appellant that improper pressure was exercised by the president on a junior member of the court, and a report might be required of that. If the Court of Appeal requires a report, obviously it should not be a report solely from the president. Nor do I feel that it should be optional upon the court of appeal just to select haphazard which member of the court from whom they required a report. Where the Court of Appeal wanted a report from the members of the court and it was practicable to do so, the right thing would be for the court to re-assemble and furnish the report as a court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Power is given under the Army Act to cause a court to be reconstituted and to be re-assembled for this, that, and the other purpose. Difficulties with regard to the exigencies of the Service no doubt arise, and arose in the last war, with regard to the re-assembly of a court-martial, but those difficulties should not be used as the overwhelming argument in support of the proposition that when a report is wanted from the court all we have to do is to ask one individual for it. The Lord Advocate has said that under the Clause as it stands, rules could be made for requiring reports from every member of the court. That may be so, but it is equally clear that, under the Clause, rules could be made only requiring a report from the president. There is force in these arguments and I hope some hon. and learned Gentleman opposite will let us have their views upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Lord Advocate that what we want is a power to get a report from the Judge Advocate—that is one thing—and a power to get a report from the members of the court—that is a second thing—and that we should, when giving that second power, include a provision excusing from attendance those whose attendance it is impossible to secure. That is all we want. If a Man has been taken from the Middle East
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
Command and flown out to Canada, obviously we ought not to be expected to bring him back to give a report on a court-martial. That would be quite impracticable. So it would be if a man had been wounded or killed. What we should at least say is that, where we can get all the members of the court to re-assemble if a report is needed from the members of the court, it should be a report signed by all of them. We need the proviso so that where we cannot get all the members together we may get as many as possible of them and have a report signed by those. I dread to think of the situation in the Court of Appeal if it received a report from the president one way and a report from another member of the court-martial another way. That would not be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is badly drawn. While I appreciate that our Amendment, which was only drafted to raise this question, may go too far in that it makes no provision for cases where the attendance of a member of a court cannot be secured, I suggest to the Lord Advocate that there is real force and weight behind the arguments in support of an Amendment on these lines and I hope he will give this serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has, of course, conceded that the Amendment does not effect the purpose which now underlies his remarks. I would point out, too, that he is now advocating that there should be a reassembling of the court and that the report should be obtained from the court as re-assembled which, of course, is not inherent in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is implied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, it is not implied that there should be a re-assembly of the court. It would be quite competent to get a report from each individual member of the court without re-assembling the court. If they were scattered after the court-martial, that would probably be the normal way of doing it, unless special provision were made for re-assembling the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pointed out that under the Army Act there is special provision for the re-assembly of the court. Obviously a report could be obtained from each member by writing to each member separately in that case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1267</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has forgotten the procedure before the Court of Appeal comes to consider the appeal. There is the conviction by the court-martial, and, except in cases involving the death sentence, there has to be the petition and the whole petition procedure, and the petition must have been turned down before the question of appeal to the Court of Appeal arises. By the efflux of time it is likely, particularly in time of war, that the members of the court will have been scattered when the call comes from the court-martial for the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman said that we should probably always want a report from the Judge Advocate, and that is very reasonable, but the way in which the Clause is framed leaves the matter much more elastic. Provision is made to call for a report from any member of the court whomsoever, and that might be individually or collectively. That will be determined by the rules of court. I should have'thought that within the framework of the Bill we wanted a provision as elastic as possible, leaving it to the rules of court, which will be subject to Parliamentary control, to determine whether or not the machinery invoked is the proper machinery. To lay down in the Bill that there must be consultation with and report from every member of the court is too rigid a formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that, in the cases quoted by the hon. and learned Gentleman with regard to the irregularity of procedure during the closed hearing of the court when the verdict is being considered, and of undue influence perpetrated by the president of the court, there would be a call for a report not only from the president but from all the members. We must attribute some intelligence to the personnel of the Court of Appeal which we are establishing. They would not call for a report from the president alone on a complaint that undue influence was brought to bear by the president on the other members. On the other hand, there might be a minor matter which could easily be determined and was not controversial as between the members of the court, such as a point of procedure, which the Court of Appeal might want to have before it, and the 'president of the court alone might be able to make the report without the necessity of reconvening the court at great inconvenience to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1268</span>
The circumstances may vary so considerably that we want to have elasticity. If it may be desirable to have a report from every member of the court, let us have an elastic procedure which will permit that, and if there happens to be a point which can be settled without controversy by one member of the court, let the procedure be sufficiently elastic to effect that. The machinery will be determined by the rules of court, which will come under Parliamentary scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will they? Not these rules of court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the rules of court will come under Parliamentary scrutiny. If the hon. and learned Member will look at Clause 22, which we have not yet reached, and which is perhaps the reason why he has not appreciated the point, he will see that these rules come under Parliamentary scrutiny. In those circumstances I would ask the Committee to accept the more elastic wording which we have used, and not the more rigid form proposed by this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Selwyn Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied with the arguments of the right hon. and learned Gentleman. He made a great play about elasticity, and said that they could accept that this appeal court will behave in a reasonable manner, having regard to the circumstances of each case. I would remind him of the arguments he advanced so forcibly against giving the appeal court power to order a new trial. It was said then that we could not give elasticity to the court in that respect. In a most eloquent speech, one hon. Member opposite said that we could not have one rule for one lot and another rule for another lot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman would not want to misrepresent me, but when I was putting forward that submission I asked him to tell us the criteria on which the new trial would be based, and he failed to give it. It was because he was unable to give us the criteria to justify such a departure from the civil criminal code, that we resisted his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Selwyn Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would probably not be in order if I were to reopen the debate on the question of the new trial. I do not admit that I did not put forward the necessary criteria, but I submit that the right hon. and learned Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1269</span>
failed to put forward the criteria on which the court could exercise this elastic judgment. I quite agree that it would be one matter to ask the opinion of the president of the court about the sentence, but we know quite well that that is not a matter upon which the opinion of the president of the court will be asked, because it is not germane for the Court of Appeal to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the type of case where there is a suggestion of undue influence. Under this Clause as it is at present. It will be open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to pick and choose the members of the court from whom they ask for a report. I think it is very important to find out what would happen under those circumstances. If a report is to be obtained, particularly in that sort of case, everybody should know that it is going to be the opinion of the whole court whether constituted as a court or whether collected individually. If it is left with the Court of Appeal to pick and choose whose opinion it should have, it will not be the same thing. Possibly a complaint is put forward through some indirect channels. If there is any report from a member of the court there is bound to be a feeling of disquiet amongst those concerned with this sort of business. I am not happy to leave it to the rules of procedure. The right hon. and learned Gentleman says that we can pray against the rules when they are put before the House, but I thought that a ground of complaint at the present time was that there were too many of these Prayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not sincere Prayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for hon. Members opposite to judge of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Selwyn Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of sincerity in the use of Parliamentary procedure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—is not one which we can discuss here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Selwyn Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree, and allegations of insincerity are as much out of order as they are unfounded. When we remember a certain guillotine procedure which we saw in this room for many months during the last Parliament, and remember the steam rolling tactics of those days, it comes ill from hon. Members opposite to be throwing about this
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
sort of empty taunt this morning. This opportunity of praying as a Parliamentary procedure to examine rules of court in detail is wholly unsatisfactory, because Amendments cannot be moved, and we can only give detailed examination to the matter when the Bill is going through the House. I am not satisfied to leave it in the position that our only check upon this matter will be by the procedure open to us of scrutinising these Statutory Rules and Orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are the rules made by the Lord Chief Justice to which reference is made by the hon. and learned Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Selwyn Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to the rules made under Clause 22. This is quite an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the matter, and I am not prepared to leave it to Prayers to deal with the rules. In the particular circumstances that I have mentioned I am sure that certain hon. Members opposite will have the same disquiet about the Court of Appeal being able to pick and choose the members of the court from whom they ask for these reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the disquiet which has been expressed by the hon. and learned Member for Northants, South (Mr. Manningham-Buller) and by the hon. and learned Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd). This Clause is quite properly drawn for the purposes of the Bill. When we come to consider the whole position, it means that the Court of Appeal can ask any member of the court-martial to give his views about a particular case. One would think from the hon. and learned Gentlemen opposite that these appeals were not going to a constituted Appeal Court. I have got sufficient confidence in these Appeal Courts to know that if they ask for a report from any member of the court-martial, that will not be a conclusive factor in the ultimate appeal. Assuming that they get an opinion or report from any member of the court-martial, it is straining the matter too far to suggest that, where the Appeal Court refers to any member of the court-martial, it would be to a particular member accused in some way of acting unjustly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A properly. constituted Appeal Court will hear the application in the normal way, and any reference to a member of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
the original court-martial is not going to be conclusive but merely as guidance. I feel that under our British traditions of justice no one would need have any qualms or fears that any report submitted in that way will either be used against a defendant or in any way influence the Appeal Court from performing their proper and legitimate functions. I suggest to the two hon. and learned Gentlemen that they are making heavy weather about it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are British courts of justice, not Gestapo courts, or courts in any totalitarian country. We are entitled to have every confidence in British courts of justice, either Appeal Courts or courts-martial as set up under this Bill. One would have thought that two hon. and learned Gentlemen would not have questioned the honesty and legitimacy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham - Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody questions that except the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to question a report asked for from a member of a court-martial I think we are entitled to rely with confidence on that report being a fair and honest report and one which will genuinely assist the court-martial appeal court in consideration of the appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard this Amendment as the most important. I have looked on the court-martial appeal court as very largely a measure to protect an accused person from any injustice arising out of any undue influence in the court. The Lord Advocate said that if an appeal was raised on this ground the appeal court would probably collect the opinions of all the members of the court, but the accused is, of course, not necessarily to know what goes on in closed session. He may not be in a position to appreciate that undue influence is at work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Lord Advocate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not raise that point, but I was answering the hon. and learned Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd). If that was a matter concerning the court, of course the court could take that particular line, but the example was quoted by the hon. and learned Member for Wirral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Ryder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind who quoted the example in the first instance, but it was stated by the Lord Advocate
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
that if the appeal were raised on these grounds the Court of Appeal could send for all the opinions of the Court. I think it is most unwise to allow a court of appeal to select or ask for the opinions of any one member of the court. One has always to look at the worst possible case in these matters. One hopes these things do not occur, but it seems that if one sends for only the opinions of the president of the court we might be falling into the very error which was committed in the court itself. These opinions, if called for, will exercise a considerable influence on the Court of Appeal and I feel we should insist on this Amendment, to which I attach the greatest importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a word about the shocking and startling observations of the hon. and learned Member for Northants, South (Mr. Manningham-Buller). He talked about possible leakage of information or opinions from the court, and I would like to know what he meant by that. It is quite irrelevant to the present discussions and quite unnecessary, to make the point which would be calculated to undermine confidence in the court, and I think the hon. and learned Gentleman should specify the grounds on which he made the observation, or withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellenger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to appeal to hon. Members opposite. I can quite see what they are aiming at. It is true that in courts-martial junior officers are inexperienced and try to do their duty as best they can. I can conceive of circumstances in which their better judgment might be over-weighed by some remarks of a senior officer. They are so trained to obedience that they respect the views of their seniors. I leave it to the hon. and learned Members of the Committee to argue the legal points. If there were any improper pressure in a court-martial it would be brought to light, and obviously, as the Lord Advocate said, the Court of Appeal would take that into consideration, and would take every action necessary. If necessary they would get the opinion of all the members of the court, and perhaps even call upon them to appear—if possible under the rules—as witnesses before the Court of Appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider this matter from a practical aspect. Courts-martial will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1273</span>
set up all over the world in time of war, and I think we are unnecessarily straining at an attempt to get justice mainly for the accused. As we have set up a novel procedure by this Bill I am not at all sure that we should follow line by line and word by word what takes place in the civil criminal courts. All we are concerned to do is to see that those accused get justice, and I am convinced that if we leave this subsection as it is and reject the Amendment the accused, and indeed everyone, will get justice in the cases which go to the Court of Appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hylton-Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not have thought it necessary to detain the Committee further about this if it did not seem to appear, with respect to the right hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger), that the real vice of this Clause as we see it does not yet seem to be appreciated. It is quite a false analogy, with respect to the Lord Advocate, to talk about reports from chairmen of quarter sessions and the like. Chairmen of quarter sessions do not decide whether someone is guilty or not guilty, but the members of a court-martial do decide. What we are doing under the Clause as it stands is, by rules of court, to make provision for calling for a report from the members, as it were, of the jury—they are the people who decide guilt or innocence—which is something quite different and has never been done before under British law. That is why I ask the Committee to consider with the greatest care what it is this Clause is providing for in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the matter is not that anyone in their senses would mistrust or misjudge this Court of Appeal we are setting up, or its members, or mistrust in any way their competence to call for the right kind of reports from the right kind of people. No one is suggesting that. What is important, in our view, is that anyone looking at the Bill—the least educated and least experienced, and perhaps more suspicious minded person who might have been convicted, or perhaps one of the convicted person's relatives—should be able to see that justice is manifestly seen to be done when a report is called for. That can only be so if not only one member of what is the equivalent of the jury is appealed to for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
his view, but all of them, because it is precisely on the views of the entirety of the court, and not of any one member, that justice is based and is obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This does not exclude it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hylton-Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we desire to see is the kind of provision of rule of court which makes it quite clear to everyone, even, with respect, to the hon. Member for Ardwick (Mr. L. M. Lever) that in each case where a report is called for from one member of the court-martial it will, as far as physically possible and practicable, be called for from each member of the court, so that the views of each of the members may be placed before the appeal court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This does not exclude it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hylton-Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one is talking about whether it excludes it. I seem very unsuccessful in making myself plain. The point is that there should be, to the public eye, to the unenlightened eye, no manner of suspicion of doubt that if a report is called for from one of these persons it shall be, whenever it is possible to do so, called for from every one of these persons, so that the entire body which decided on guilt or innocence, as the case may be, may be able to present its views individually to the court. Of course, this provision does not exclude that being done. What we desire is the kind of provision which will make it manifest that in every case it will be done, subject to the practical difficulties of the situation. I hope that the Committee will not pass this Clause without amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to speak again. I fear that on this Amendment, judging from the speeches made from the other side of the Committee, we have proceeded too fast. It was obvious from the speech made by the hon. Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. L. M. Lever), and I am afraid from the disappointing speech made by the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes), that really the point behind this Amendment had not been appreciated at all by them. Indeed, I fear that it had not been appreciated sufficiently by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr, Bellenger). I am sorry that that should be because we went too fast. Let me assure the right hon. Member for Bassetlaw that I am convinced that both sides of this Committee are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1275</span>
desirous of doing all they can to see that an accused gets justice. We approach this matter entirely from that angle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Ardwick will follow, I think I shall be able to convince him that there is great force behind our argument. I want to put it as shortly and simply as possible, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to follow. A court-martial takes place. Then there is a petition which is rejected. The petitioner may put it forward on the aground that something went wrong in closed court. One does not know. It is only when we get right up to the Court of Appeal that we are giving, by this Clause, a power to that Court to send to the members, or a member, of the original court-martial for a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. and learned Friend said, that is a very novel power; but of course, the Court of Appeal is a novel institution for courts-martial. What we are concerned with is the circumstances in which any court of appeal desirous of doing justice, as all courts of appeal are, is likely to want to use that power. Before we give that power, we should ask under what circumstances it is likely to be used. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for York (Mr. Hylton-Foster) said, it is a novel power because it is not a power concerned with sentences. A Court of Appeal is not concerned with sentences. To use the analogy of the civil courts, it is a power to obtain a report from a member of the jury as to what went on in the jury room. That is a very novel power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put forward, because I think it might be helpful to the Committee, the sort of circumstances in which possibly the Court of Appeal might find it desirable to ask for a report. Because I suggested that there might have been some leakage about what happened in closed court giving rise to the matter coming before the Court of Appeal, I drew upon myself the wrath of the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North. Of course, I have no doubt that he is particularly sensitive just at this Budget time to any suspicion of leakage. It was a most disappointing interruption. I thought that he might have contributed something of greater, value to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Advocate may be able to confirm that the only time when a Court of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>
Appeal may want a report from members of the court-martial is possibly when some suggestion comes before the Court of Appeal about something going wrong in closed court. I refer to a closed court because if it was something going wrong elsewhere—if witnesses were not sworn or something like that—then obviously a report could be obtained from the Judge Advocate. If we are to get a report from a member of the court-martial about what happened in closed court, this is where we come to the crux of the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the rules could provide for getting a report from all members of the court-martial. Equally, they could provide that a report could be obtained only from certain members of the court-martial. The answer may be "Well, have another Prayer." I would rather get the matter straight and avoid the necessity for having another Prayer, particularly when one cannot amend the rules. I think that the argument of the Lord Advocate indicated the fallacy here. Suppose there is a need for the report in the circumstances I have indicated. The Lord Advocate said, "If it is a point of not very great importance and if you ask the president, the matter can be settled without controversy." I think I have quoted him correctly. That is just the danger. It may appear to the court, having merely asked the president, that they have settled the controversy. The president may say one thing, but another member of the court, if he was asked, may say, "As a matter of fact, that is not a point which may be settled without controversy for this, that and the other reason."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the danger if we are to select one person, one member of the court, no matter who he is, to answer a question from the Court of Appeal. One might get an answer which does not correctly represent the views of the court-martial about what happened. We suggest that power should be kept to ask the Judge Advocate about anything that takes place while he is present. Then we say that when the Court of Appeal, intending to act upon information received, asks for information about what took place in closed court when the Judge Advocate was not there, it is not sufficient to ask for the opinion of only one member. What we want to lay down as a general principle is that when the Court of Appeal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
ask for the opinion of members about what happened in closed court they should get the opinion of all the members who are available and who can express an opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if there is a divergence of view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then two opinions would be expressed. That is just the reason why we should get the opinion of all members. If there is a divergence of view, surely the Court of Appeal should be informed; but if we are to ask for the opinion of only one member, that information may not get to the Court of Appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellenger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What leads the hon. and learned Gentleman to think that in a case such as he has quoted, where information is given to the Court of Appeal that a member of the court-martial was unduly misdirected in closed court, the Court of Appeal would not ask that member for his opinion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will put the matter in this way. The simplest illustration of all arguments advanced before the Court of Appeal may be that the president of the court-martial in closed court exerted improper pressure on a junior about how to vote. That is the simplest case of the lot. That information could only emerge if there was a leakage such as I suggested when I roused the wrath of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North. Sometimes there are leakages, and he ought not to get so indignant about my suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court may say, "Let us get a report." The report goes to the president who may say straightaway, "This is absolute nonsense. I never said anything of the sort." The Lord Advocate may say that that is one of those points which may be settled without controversy; but I suggest that in a case like that it will be essential to get the opinion of all the members of the court. They may express different opinions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I have had some experience of courts-martial in closed court and I cannot see any occasion likely to arise when it will be desirable in the interest of justice only to obtain the opinion of one member of the court. I cannot see that there will be any point, which the Lord Advocate says can be settled without controversy, where one would require to obtain a report from a member of the court and it will be sufficient in the interests of justice only to obtain a report from one member.</p>
	<p>We believe there is great importance behind this and I hope we have been able to reveal it to hon. Gentlemen opposite. I ask the Lord Advocate to give it further consideration and to say that he will seek to provide for the taking of the opinion of all members of the court where that is practicable. I do not mind if they are reassembled to sit together to make a report or are written to individually to make a report on a particular point. That is a matter of machinery. I cannot see any instance likely to arise where one would be likely to require the report of only one member.</p>
	<p>It is very important that we should lay down in the rules the principles that should be observed. When one is going to ask what happened in closed court, and if one is going to take power to do that, then one must accept the obligation to find out the views of all those present in that closed court at that time, whether those views are in agreement or otherwise. Each man's views has the same weight in closed court, whether that man is the president or a junior member. I hope the Lord Advocate will say that further consideration will be given to this matter. There are no party politics in it at all, but it is a point to which we attach importance because we believe that this kind of alteration would be an improvement in the Bill and in the working of this Court of Appeal procedure.</p>
	<p>Question put, "That the word proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 21; Noes, 12.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 12, line 12, to leave out from "court-martial," to the second "or," in line 13. and to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"by which the appellant or applicant was convicted."</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting Amendment without which, at first glance, the words might suggest that a court-martial had succeeded in convicting one of its own members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<div class='title'>—(DUTIES OF REGISTRAR WITH RESPECT TO APPEALS, &C.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hylton-Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can I want to elicit some information for the Committee from the Government on this Clause. Subsection (2) provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The registrar shall furnish the necessary. forms and instructions relating to applications for leave to appeal under this Part of this Act to any person who demands them, to persons in charge of places where persons sentenced by courts-martial may lawfully be confined.—."</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us of the greatest importance that if a person is to have free exercise of his right to appeal in due time and at the due place there shall be proper and efficient machinery for getting these forms distributed throughout every part of the globe where Forces might be stationed. Unless these forms get there the unfortunate appellant will not have the right of appeal. I should be grateful to have some information as to what is proposed in Army, Navy and Air Force circles in the way of machinery to distribute these forms to the right places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1280</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Brigadier Prior-Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These forms should be distributed to all units in all three Services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I should be right in saying that we need not go into great detail at this stage. I will note the suggestions made. By a later Clause the Act itself comes into force by a date to be fixed by Order in Council, partly because a great many preliminary arrangements, of which this is only one, will have to be made. But in all the Services we shall take great care to see that the men are informed of their rights and of how those rights can be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Manningham-Buller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important part of the machinery of the Bill, and I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty to explain how the registrar is going to ensure that copies of these necessary forms are available on a ship serving many thousands of miles away. If he can assure us that the machinery is available it will be interesting to know how it is going to operate. I do not know whether he can do it now or whether he wants further time for reflection. It may be that he will want notice of this before he explains how it is to be done. I hope the Under-Secretary of State to the War Office will also tell us next time, quite shortly, how it is proposed to be done in the Army.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
