	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Law</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 15, line 4, at the end, to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated proportionately according to the gross value of white fish landed but."</p></blockquote>
We have now come to the most disagreeable part of the Bill. So far we have been discussing the great benefits which we all hope—some of us with more conviction than others—will accrue to the fishing industry from the operation of the White Fish Authority. We now come to the less agreeable question of how the benefits are to be paid for. It is a principle of this financial arrangement that there should be a general levy on the white fish industry. Certainly we have no quarrel with that principle, and the Amendment does nothing to interfere with it. It is not the purpose of the Amendment to interfere with that general principle nor to vary the amount which would be raised by the levy; it is designed simply to change the incidence of the levy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a principle of taxation which is generally accepted—the levy is, in effect, a tax on the white fish industry to pay for the benefits which we hope will come to it—that those with the greater money incomes contribute proportionately more in taxation than those with smaller money incomes. As it stands, the Clause utterly denies that principle. Under the Clause those with the smaller money incomes would pay the greater amount of tax and those with the greater money incomes would pay the smaller amount of tax. It is easy to see how this happens, but, on the face of it, it seems quite reasonable that there should be a general levy of a penny per stone. It would be reasonable if the value of fish was uniform and if the different kinds of fish had the same value, but the values of fish differ enormously, and in practice under the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>1116</span>
the result of the difference would be that the section of the fishing industry with the heaviest landings, which would therefore pay the heaviest amount of tax, has the smallest money income with which to pay that tax, and 	<i>vice versa.</i>
In 1950 the distant water section of the industry landed a little more than seven million hundredweight of fish. The value of that was £12,500,000 and the tax paid was £236,000. The near and inshore water sections landed a little less than seven million hundredweight, of a value of not £12,500,000 but £19,500,000, and the tax payable was not £236,000 but £227,000. In other words, the near water ports, with an income greater by £7 million, will pay less taxation than distant water ports with a smaller income. I realise that many hon. Members of the Committee, and a number of my hon. Friends, will not approve of the Amendment as a matter of expediency, but I do not see how they can disapprove of it as a matter of justice because the Clause seems to work a real injustice as it is framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is the levy to be raised; at what stage will it be paid, and who in the first instance will pay it? It must be paid by either the producer or consumer of white fish. If it is paid by the producer it will be paid by the fishermen, and that means that the long distance fishermen will have to pay a greater amount than the inshore and near water fishermen. If on the other hand, it is paid by the consumer, it means in effect that the consumer at the fried fish shop will have to pay a levy in order to subsidize the customer at the Ritz Hotel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends who represent near water ports ought to reflect on the effect which the Amendment would have on foreign imports. It is often thought that near water men are affected by competition from the distant water sections of the trawling industry, but I do not think that is so, because the various amounts of fish which they respectively produce are in no way competitive. What does affect the near water men are importations of boxed fish. According to such calculations as I have been able to make, the Amendment would double the amount of the levy on the importation of boxed fish, and that is a point which hon. Members representing near water ports would be very wise to consider before seeking to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1117</span>
reject the Amendment out of hand. I hope very much that the Committee will give full considerations to the arguments which I have put forward. I am sure they must feel that the present arrangement under Clause 15 is inequitable. I hope the Minister will be able to tell the Committee that he will accept this very modest and sensible Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee will resist the blandishments of the right hon. Gentleman, who put his case so very reasonably and, I am sorry to say, very plausibly. Although such arguments sound very well, they are really very specious. We know that he is fulfilling his duty to his constituents, and we all admire him for that, but I appeal to hon. Members who represent the near water and inshore fishing to look very guardedly at the Amendment, which seems to me to be unfair to the near water and inshore fishermen, and particularly to the inshore men. It is an attempt to remove the burden of the levy from those who in my opinion are best able to bear it, and that is the most highly capitalised and the most regularly prosperous sections of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that the large trawler owners do not want financial assistance and that they look askance at it. It is the first time in my experience, limited though it is, that an industry has turned down monetary help, but it is on record that this industry does not want to be helped. But they will get it in spite of themselves if the Amendment is carried, and they will get it at the expense of the members of the industry who are least able to bear the burden. I do not quarrel with the figures given by the right hon. Gentleman, but one finds that the earnings of the inshore fisherman are sporadic. I have been out lobster fishing and have not caught one. Perhaps I am not very skilful. The near water fishermen are subject to the disabilities consequent on over-fishing and their catches vary considerably from day to day and from trip to trip, and over the year their incomes are irregular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the large trawlers which go to the far waters have a regular source of supply. As yet there is no over-fishing in their areas, and I hope there never will be. They have a tremendous amount of reserve, and, broadly speaking, they can dispose of their fish, in view of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1118</span>
its quality, at very reasonable prices. At least, they could. Let me rather say that the fish is landed at reasonable prices. As to the value of a single near water or inshore catch, sometimes a couple of soles will make the price of a stone of cheaper fish. In view of the variable character of the catches, the instability, and the danger of coming in empty, it is extremely unfair to mulct these men of a levy on the value of their catch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Committee will resist the Amendment. It puts a premium on low quality, whereas the Bill is designed, as it has always been explicitly stated, to provide good quality fish at a reasonable price with an adequate return to the fishermen. The Amendment would militate against that desire. We have heard the words "justice" and "equity". We all agree with the tendency these days. that those most able to bear the burden should carry it. In this case those who, have large regular sources of supply and can make reasonable returns on their capital should not try to pass that burden to the smaller men. For that and other reasons, I hope the Committee will reject the Amendment. I cannot see how the Amendment would be implemented. Although there is, on the face of it, some sort of rough justice in the case put by the right hon. Gentleman, I am sure that those of us who have at heart the interests of the smaller men will, on reflection, reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Hudson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Law) put the case very fully and clearly. The hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Edward Evans) spoke about a "specious" argument. Surely there can be no argument more specious than to suggest that any body of tradespeople or industrialists will benefit because it is proposed that taxation should be put on an equitable basis all the way through, as distinct from a basis which is heavily loaded against one section?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been suggested throughout this discussion that the weight of taxation or duty should be borne by those most able to bear it, but, if the Clause is left as it stands, precisely the opposite will prevail. It is suggested that a penny per stone shall apply to cod which may be making sixpence a stone and which constitutes the main fish diet of large sections of the working class, while sole and plaice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1119</span>
which go to luxury tables and into the hotels would only have to bear the same penny per stone. It is an altogether inequitable burden as the Clause stands. The poor will be paying for the rich, and that ought to be very clearly understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander Pursey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member ought to say that from this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hudson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing new in the idea of the 	<i>ad valorem</i> principle in regard to food, even in regard to fish, because there already exists, in the Import Duties Act, provision for percentage duty in reference to fish like fresh shellfish, fish roes and preserved fish. If the Clause is allowed to stand, the poor will have to pay for the rich which is precisely what we want to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. George Brown)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will help the Committee to make some progress if I intervene at this stage because as far as I have heard the arguments they are based on a misconception of what the Clause, if left alone, does. If one enters the discussion as to who are the poor in this matter of the industry, the distant water section or the near and inshore fishermen, one would get into an argument which seems to depend upon the constituency for which one sits rather than, necessarily, the facts of the case. That shows how unwise it would be to try to legislate in this Committee in this way and to try to decide where the balance of need lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view we have taken is that we should set up a strong Authority, independent of these considerations which must unhappily affect Members of Parliament from time to time, and leave them, subject to general guidance, to get on with the job and to decide where the incidence ought to lie. The right hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Law) and the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. W. R. Hudson) have taken the view that if the Clause is left alone it means necessarily that the levy must be raised on a tonnage basis. I am advised that that is not so at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of putting in this Amendment would be to tie the hands of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1120</span>
Authority and to tell them in advance how the levy is to be raised. The effect of not putting in the Amendment but leaving the Clause as it stands is to say in subsection (2, 	<i>a</i>) what the limit in terms of money of any levy raised up to a limit of one penny a stone shall be—in the present state of things—£430,000 a year, and subsection (3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any levy imposed by the Authority under this section shall be payable by such persons engaged in the white fish industry, in such proportions and at such times as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
It leaves the Authority the job of deciding what in the light of all the circumstances is the most equitable way of raising the levy having decided to raise it within the general limit we put on them. I feel we would be much better advised to leave it for them to work the thing out than to come forward with a regulation under Clause 5 as they will have to do. They may decide that so much per stone is the right way, or they may take some other view. When they come forward with a regulation there will be a chance for Parliament to discuss it if it wishes to do so, but the decision will be arrived at in the first place by folk not subjected to these pulls who can take a better and wider view of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not propose, if I can help it, to get involved in the argument which has been launched. I would only say that I think the argument is not so much one sided in favour of 	<i>ad valorem</i> as hon. Members opposite suggest, but there is quite a lot to be said for the other view. Those men who at the moment may be thought to be well away and who catch fish in great quantities, may feel it unfair that this has happened, but it is the disposal of their fish which raises considerable difficulty. It may be that they would get the most benefit out of the Authority, and in that case those working in the near water and inshore should have to pay. I do not say I hold that view but I merely say it is a different argument which, in certain circumstances, can be put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, having given air to the views of constituents of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen who sit for various ports, the Committee will feel that at this stage we are well out of this particular argument and that it is best to give the Authority the over-riding limit and, within
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1121</span>
that limit, to allow them to take all considerations into account and leave them untrammelled so that Parliament can look at the regulation when it is brought forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Odey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look at the matter further. I could not agree with him more in saying that it is very unfortunate to discuss a Clause of this kind from the point of view of constituency interest. I have no constituency interest, apart from the fact that my constituency is near Hull and in my constituency we have built the finest trawlers in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interest which hon. Members opposite are always endeavouring to speak of as if it was their own special preserve —and I want to assure them that it is not —is the consumer of this country. The consumer relies essentially for cheap fish on the long distance fishing of the trawler industry, and the objection to this levy in the form in which it stands at present is that it is a flat levy falling on all classes of fish, irrespective of quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely hon. Members opposite, who are always complaining that what they regard as luxury fish should be caught at all should not object if luxury fish, as they describe it, should bear a higher rate of levy. When we remember that the whole object of the Amendment is to see that the supply of cheap fish is kept to as low a level of price as possible, surely on the grounds of logic alone the Amendment should commend itself to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in page 15, line 9, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"including in particular schemes designed to equalise or reduce freight charges."</p></blockquote>
I must say at once that this is unashamedly a constituency point. My only excuse is that I think it also affects a good many other constituencies in the North of Scotland, perhaps particularly that of the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan). This question of freights is a matter of the utmost importance, not only to the fishing industry in my constituency, but to the whole question of whether life and work shall go on there. The very high rates of freight are making it increasingly difficult for fishermen to earn a decent livelihood and, unless they are curtailed, they will make
	<span class='label label-info column'>1122</span>
the work of the Authority almost impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is an admittedly second or third best attempt because what I want is a properly thought out and comprehensive policy from the Government about freight charges in general. But that is outside the scope of this Authority. All this Authority can do will not satisfy the needs of my constituency, but under the old control scheme we did gain very considerably by the equalisation levy and we very much regretted it when that system came to an end. My Amendment is designed to give specific power to reintroduce some scheme which will either equalise freight charges, or very much reduce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already made one speech about the high rate of freight charges and will not say any more about them, but there has been a great deal of talk in the past and today about the conflict of interest in the different parts of the fishing industry, particularly between the inshore fisherman and the trawler. It would be folly to deny that some conflict exists, but it should not be exaggerated. After all, however prosperous the fishing industry in Shetland, the Western Isles or around the Moray Firth, it will not put Hull or Lowestoft out of business. We deal in a different quality of fish and I have never met a Shetland fisherman who does not pay the highest tribute to the men who work the trawlers. In general, I would say the conflict in the industry can be exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask those who represent trawling interests if possible not to be too hard when it comes to paying out a certain amount to help the inshore fishermen. It is a very small matter to them, but it is a very vital matter to the inshore men in various parts of the country where there are not many other forms of employment and where they catch a quality of fish which is different from that caught by the trawlers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member suggest that the transport levy which was imposed on this industry during the control period should be shifted to the bulk subsidy money and that out of that a transport levy should come?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be one way of dealing with it, but I ask that the trawling interest should not oppose this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1123</span>
as it is in the interests of inshore fishermen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member who moved this Amendment to reduce freight charges, in his honesty and sincerity mentioned that this was a completely constituency question. But it rather appeared to me that he was thinking of the question of freight charges and haulage in Scotland alone, and he should not forget their importance in Cornwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it affects Cornwall as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better get this right because, although the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) suggested modestly that it affected him particularly, we should understand that it affects all Scotland and, no doubt, also Cornwall. It certainly affects all Scotland. The case of my constituency in Fife is that, in spite of the fact that the Secretary of State for Scotland on an earlier occasion did not seem to accept it, a good deal of our fish is sent to England, to the Midlands and sometimes actually to London, and that has been happening for a great many years. That transport charge is a great burden upon the men whom I represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I met the fishermen in Fife two or three weeks ago two questions were impressed upon me as being more important than any others. One was the high cost of gear, which does not arise under this Amendment, and the other was the question of transport costs. If the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland can achieve anything in the direction of enabling the Authority to cope with this transport problem, he will have done a great service to the industry. I warmly support the intention of this Amendment, and I trust that something will be done to meet it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Thomas Fraser)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I can help the Committee. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) knows that the Authority will have power to make a scheme to deal with this matter. All he suggests in his Amendment is that certain words should be added to Clause 15, which deals with the raising of moneys by the Authority, to make it clear that they shall, in par
	<span class='label label-info column'>1124</span>
ticular, raise these moneys for the purpose of a scheme for the equalisation of freight charges, or with a view to reducing freight charges. I think the Committee need only look at the Amendment against the background of the subsection to which it is proposed to add it, to see how wrong it would be to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the biggest or most important job which the Authority will have to undertake. It is not a problem which is quite so urgent as some hon. Members think. It is perhaps highly desirable that we should have reduced transport costs. It is perhaps arguable that we should have a scheme for the equalisation of freight charges. But I have seen a sample check made recently, and the hon. Member for Fife, East (Mr. Stewart) will be interested to know that, on an average, the fishermen pay less in transport costs now than when they were paying the Ministry of Food levy. The fish sent to Central London incurs a higher cost than the 6s. 8d. per cwt. imposed by the Ministry of Food. But, taking the whole of the fish, the fact is that a lower transport charge is imposed just now than was imposed under the controlled scheme operated by the Ministry of Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Power is contained in this Bill for the Authority to deal with the matter. It seems to us to be wrong to add these words which would make it a particular duty of the Authority to raise moneys Or the purpose of dealing with this transport problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman said to the effect that transport charges are less than they were before. I heard that statement made from the Government benches a month or two ago. It was known to those whom I represent. They simply do not understand it. I should like to ask the hon. Gentleman whether the figures include road transport, which accounts for a very large measure of the transport of our fish. I do not think that is taken into account, and we know that the cost of road transport has risen recently. I find the greatest difficulty in accepting that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does. There are many ports in Scotland—I do not want to mention them all—where, on average, transport costs are much higher than they were under the Ministry of Food
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1125</span>
control scheme, but the East Fife ports, on an average, are spending less now on transport than they did when the Ministry's scheme was in operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask a question. The Minister has said that there are powers in the Bill to promote schemes for equalising freight charges. How are those schemes to be financed? This Clause is one which deals with finance. The Amendment moved by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) is designed to provide moneys for the purpose of financing any schemes for equalising freight charges. Unless an Amendment of this sort is included, I cannot see how schemes for the equalisation of charges can be financed. This seems to be the appropriate Clause in which to do that, and the Amendment seems to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that this is very important from my point of view as a constituency point. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that life becomes impossible in some of the fishing centres such as Aberdeen and those in the far North-East unless something is done to equalise freight charges and to make possible the transport of fish at a more reasonable rate which will enable them to compete with those places which are nearer to the consuming centres in the south. As the intention of this Authority is to try to promote the interests of the industry—it has the overall intention of promoting the interests—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Was not the hon. and learned Member asking a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question I wish to ask is whether the Minister would reconsider what he has said with regard to this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend surprises me. The opening words of this subsection are
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority shall have power, for the purpose of financing the discharge of their functions…"</p></blockquote>
We must then refer to earlier Clauses to discover what those functions are. Hon. Members will remember the long discussion we had on Clause 6, and I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend does not want all the functions set out in the earlier Clauses to be recited in this sub-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1126</span>
section. I do not think there is any need to continue this discussion. I am sure that hon. Members feel that it would be a mistake to add these words to the Bill. The mover of the Amendment made his case. The point has been made that the Authority have power to include such a provision in their schemes if they are so minded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Tweedsmuir</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that when the Joint Under-Secretary of State addressed this Committee the whole fishing industry would have welcomed it very much if he had seen fit to give an assurance that the Government are very much alive to what is one of the greatest burdens on outlying fishing industries. I should like to have heard him say that he would advise the Authority of how the Government propose to reduce these charges, either by equalisation schemes or by reviewing transport charges generally, which I understand are now under discussion.

Of course, this problem affects us in the north of Scotland or in Cornwall, as the hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. D. Marshall) has said, very much indeed. We are a long way from the central markets. While it is most difficult to ask for a direct subsidy, we must remember that the only way in which to approach this question is from the point of view of the strategic importance of our outlying ports. If we are to have such heavy charges as we have now in north-east Scotland, quite apart from the value of the fishing industry, it will be impossible for us to be able to keep in good order all our instalments which will be needed in any strategic emergency. If the Under-Secretary could see fit to give the Committee an assurance that the Government are very much alive to the great importance of this subject, we should feel more satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Joint Under-Secretary when he says that this is a matter of limited effect. It has a very great effect. It affects people in all outlying ports.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Duthie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must join issue with the Joint Under-Secretary on the somewhat rosy impression he gave concerning Scottish ports. Since the decontrol of fish and the departure from the equalisation of rates, practically all ports far removed from central markets, especially those in Scotland, and particularly in the Moray Firth, have been at a grave disadvantage. I am sure that those members of the Authority who have visited these ports are fully aware of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a constituency matter, though my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) put it forward somewhat modestly from that point of view. This matter affects every fishing port which is far removed from a central market. Any basic scheme put forward by the Authority which does not do something towards the equalisation of rates will fail in its purpose. This is a matter of the highest importance and I am glad that it has been raised for discussion, if for nothing else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm MacMillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may speak at the very last, I would point out that it just goes to show how very much places like the Western Islands can be neglected even in a Standing Committee. I had not suggested an Amendment of this kind, and the reason for my not doing so was that I was in the Western Islands along with the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Alex Anderson) and two members of the Opposition. During our visit to the Western Islands we had a conference of local authorities and Government Departments, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Motherwell will agree with me that no question was more stressed as being of vital importance to the Islands than the question of freight charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that few questions could possibly affect adversely the life of the Islands so much as that of excessive freight charges. The value of this Amendment is that the more we can emphasise the importance of this question in the work of the new White Fish Authority, and especially the Scottish Committee, which will virtually be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1128</span>
White Fish Authority in respect of Scotland, the better it will be. It will be a good thing if the Authority start off with a sense of the importance which this Committee attaches to the question of reducing freight charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was estimated in my constituency on a very reliable basis that the lowest sum by which the cost of living was forced up over that of Scotland generally as a result of freight charges was 1s. at the Port of Stornoway which is the most convenient point of access to the mainland. In the remoter areas and the smaller islands it amounts to a figure of over 2s. in the pound. These charges, after goods have left the neighbouring island of Great Britain and started on their way across the Atlantic to the Western Isles are of vital importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding fish exported from the Islands, I give in brief a significant example of the adverse effect which high freight charges have upon the fishing industry there. Four thousand barrels of herring could have been landed only the other day at Ullapool; but at the port of Stornoway, where there is a harbour valued at about £1 million, including improvements now being partly financed by this Government, practically no herrings were landed at all. Ninety per cent. of the reason for that was the excessive freight charges which the industry has to bear in the Western Islands to send its product across the Minch, and south by rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This question cannot be over emphasised. As my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Donnelly) said a few moments ago, rail freight charges are to be increased. But, quite apart from the fact that the industry already has to pay the ordinary rail and road charges, which are heavy enough, in addition the Islands' industry has to pay, I am informed, a sea surcharge on the fish leaving the Islands. Anything which can be done to assist to equalise these charges, by whatever method which may be advised, would be a great blessing to the economic development of the Islands. Without such an equalisation they cannot hold their own in the fishing industry which, in turn, is the basis, the life, of the whole hinterland of the island community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment they are suffering from excessive freight charges on their products
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1129</span>
leaving the Islands, and they are paying high freight charges on goods coming into the Islands. The number of unemployed was until recently, rising towards the 2,000 mark in the Island of Lewis and Harris alone. Many hundreds of these unemployed are fishermen who can no longer live by the fishing industry, largely because of the excessive burden of transport charges. The two staple industries of the Islands are in a depression. The basic, and most important industry is obviously the fishing industry, but the second industry—Harris Tweed weaving —suffers from the imposition of a Purchase Tax of 66⅔ per cent. on its products. It suffers, too, from the increasing price of wool. It is in acute danger of real depression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry is suffering under excessive freight charges which are making it almost impossible for the industry to continue in a port where we are now spending over £300,000 on improvements and extensions. Anything which can be done to emphasise the need for a freight rates reduction in the minds of the White Fish Authority or the Scottish Committee—which amounts to the White Fish Authority for Scotland—would be a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond) upon raising this issue. While I admit that it may already be within the competence of the Authority to take this action, I wish the Parliamentary Secretary could have said to the Authority in the most glowing terms, "This is one of your prime and most important functions in dealing with the problem of these outlying areas affected adversely, as they are, more by the question of freight charges than by almost anything else."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Law</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point of view on this Amendment which has not been put before the Committee and which I should like to put now, very briefly and I hope without offending any of my hon. Friends who have spoken in favour of the Amendment. It is perfectly true that the fishermen of East Fife or Aberdeen or Orkney and Shetland are at a disadvantage, by comparison with the fishermen of Hull or Lowestoft or any Southern port, in respect of freight charges to the London market. I think the Committee ought to be careful of trying altogether to equalise all the conditions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1130</span>
the fishing industry, because while it is true that the fishermen of Aberdeen or East Fife are at a disadvantage in some respects, it is equally true that the fishermen of Hull are at a disadvantage in other respects. While Aberdeen is 500 miles instead of 20 miles from the market, the fishermen of Hull have to go 2,000 miles instead of 20 miles to get their fish. At any rate, as far as distance water fishing is concerned, Aberdeen is 300 or 400 miles nearer the fishing grounds than is Hull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we begin trying to equalise all the conditions of the industry as a whole in that kind of meticulous way we shall build up one unfairness against another. We shall not make the whole thing fairer and more just in general. The Minister said the Authority have power to introduce schemes to equalise freight charges, but I hope they will think very hard before they do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for more than a few minutes, but I should like to congratulate the Committee, if I may do so without presumption, upon its unanimity. Every hon. Member who has spoken has expressly disavowed the intention of making a constituency speech—with the exception of the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond)—and then has proceeded to make the most of the opportunity. I should like to congratulate the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland for giving every hon. Member something about which he could talk from his heart. Undoubtedly, transport charges are a vital issue if we are to hold the remote outposts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a mistake, however, to ignore two things. First and foremost, before the new White Fish Authority get down to the question of Transport charges they will find that there are limiting factors. To begin with, the best is not made of the markets, because fish from St. Margarets Bay or Scalloway is sent to Billingsgate and seems to travel the longest possible distance and at the maximum possible price which can possibly be charged. The new Authority will have to take into consideration the question of where fish should be sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly—and I have seen this with my own eyes—the Authority will have to bear this sort of thing in mind. I have seen roughly gutted fish put in boxes and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1131</span>
iced up, put on the train and expensive transport charges paid to Manchester or Birmingham, where, immediately 40 per cent. is thrown away—and that after transport charges have been paid on it. The Authority will have to take into consideration such factors as those and will have to process more at the ports—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I think it does, but I will leave the point at the moment. This Amendment raises a very large question; it seeks to add to the Authority responsibility for organising cheap transport to areas in cases where the whole national economy should be used to do the job. Given sufficient powers, such as we already have in the Bill, that action can be taken without the Amendment being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to reinforce the claim made at any rate for a reduction in respect of fishing ports in remote areas such as Cornwall, even if they cannot be equalised. I should also like to reinforce the point made by the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Alex Anderson) about the rationalisation of the distribution of fish. In the town of Camborne-Redruth in West Cornwall, where I live, we have the ridiculous situation of fish being sent to Billingsgate from Newlyn while fish comes from Milford Haven to Camborne and Redruth. I hope something can be done by the White Fish Authority to bring some sanity into these arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let us take the pilchard industry, which is a specialised industry. A penny a stone would be a very great burden upon them in comparison with some other forms of the industry.

	<div class='clause'>Clause 18.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(GENERAL PROVISIONS ABOUT OFFENCES.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Erroll</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 18, line 9, to leave out subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scattered through this Bill there are and must necessarily be a number of penalties for offences committed in contravention of the provisions of the Bill. Clause 18 contains some general provisions about offences. I am particularly concerned about subsection (6) and, in the Amendment which I have moved, I seek to delete it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this subsection is to secure, more rigorously perhaps than is fair or just, the execution of penalties described in earlier Clauses. The Clauses in which the penalties are specifically outlined state that where a person is convicted he will be liable to fines and, in some cases, imprisonment. The difficulty arises, of course, where the guilty party is not a person but is a body corporate—that is, a company. This subsection seeks to carry the penalty from the body corporate which has been proved guilty to the individual or individuals within that body corporate so that they may be imprisoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of particular issue here is that the penalties in the earlier Clauses are both fines and imprisonment. It is easy to fine a body corporate, but it is not possible to put a body corporate into prison. It is, therefore, necessary for the prosecution to proceed against one or more individuals within that body corporate. It has chosen what I think is a particularly unfortunate way of doing so for, by means of this subsection, the prosecution will be able to say that all members of the body corporate, as defined in the subsection, can be deemed guilty until, more or less, they can prove their innocence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the prosecution is able to say, "Your company is guilty and, therefore, you are all guilty unless you can prove your innocence, unless you can prove that the offence was committed without your consent or connivance and that the individual so charged exercised all such diligence as he could to prevent the commission of the offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is reversal of the tradition of British justice which assumes that all men and women are innocent until their guilt is proved. The reversal of the tradition of British justice is particularly
	<span class='label label-info column'>1134</span>
serious in this case, because a prison sentence is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not merely a matter of paying a fine. Here a man who may be liable to imprisonment has got to prove his innocence to avoid being sent to prison, which seems a most unreasonable provision to find in a comparatively non-controversial Measure such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving the deletion of this subsection I have no desire to shield the guilty, but I do feel that by requiring the defendant to prove a negative the burden of proof may well become too heavy and result in the conviction, not only of the guilty but also of the innocent It is perfectly possible for the prosecution to secure the conviction of an individual by the normal processes of the law. The fact that it may be more difficult to do so because they cannot assume him guilty is surely no reason or justification for the inclusion of this reversal of the standard practice in a Bill of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dare say that whoever replies for the Government will cite a number of precedents, and there certainly are a number of so-called precedents in earlier Acts. In, for example, the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1918, there was some justification for the reversal of the principle because the public interest was rightly deemed by the Parliament of the day to be so great as to justify the reversal. If a body corporate was found to be peddling dangerous drugs it was quite right to assume all the members of that body corporate guilty until they could prove their innocence, in order to stamp out the traffic in dangerous drugs. The same might apply to, for example, the Prevention of Corruption Act, where the fact that a civil servant had received money from an individual was in itself. such an unusual occurrence as to merit the reversal of the onus of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, however, we look at this particular subsection we find that the actual misdemeanours are of a very much lighter order than the two I have quoted. They are merely failure to give information or the abuse of a licence granted by the Authority. While those are offences which should not have been committed, they are surely not of sufficient gravity as to justify this reversal of the principle of traditional British justice. The Clause in its present form has appeared in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1135</span>
number of nationalisation Measures since the war, and has rightly been contested by the Opposition on a number of occasions. The reasons given for it on previous occasions have always been that it is convenient for the prosecution to have this method, and that it has appeared before. What we want from the Government is proof of need of this reversal of the principle. That has never been given so far; we have never been shown any proof of need for this subsection. I submit, furthermore, that this subsection is not necessary. The prosecution can prosecute without it, if only they will take the necessary trouble to prepare their case adequately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since this type of Clause last appeared in the Committee stage of a Bill there has been a welcome change in the attitude of certain parties. In two local authority Bills this offending subsection appeared in a very similar form when the Bills were originally drafted, namely the Worcester Corporation Bill and the Sunderland Corporation Bill. When representations were made to those two bodies they gladly withdrew the offending subsection as they realised that the provisions in the rest of the Bill did not justify such a reversal of British justice. I suggest that here in this Committee we follow this new and valuable precedent by removing a subsection which does no credit to traditional British justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Odey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what my hon. Friend has said on this subsection. I must say that I do so with a certain amount of feeling as I am a company director myself. I hope that what my hon. Friend has said will commend itself to this Committee, because surely the right and liberties of the subjects of .this country are matters of concern to both sides of the Committee, and there should be no difference between us. A very fundamental objection to this subsection is that it lays upon directors the onus of proving themselves innocent, which is quite contrary to the whole principle of British justice which lays down that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty. I hope that on those grounds alone the Minister will see his way clear to withdraw this very objectionable subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Douglas Johnston)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>1136</span>
knows, and as the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Erroll) said, in our law a company is a person separate from that of its constituent members or directors or other servants. That separate 	<i>persona</i> of the company gives rise to very great difficulties on occasion. One notable judge said that a difficulty was that a corporation had neither a soul to be damned nor a body to be kicked. The result of that is that the criminal law has in many cases great difficulty in proceeding against a company. It is true that where the company does an overt act, an act of commission, one can always proceed not only against the company but against the servant of the company who commits that act. That does not, of course, apply where the act is not an act of commission but is an act of omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a new provision. The law has for a number of years taken two steps to overcome the difficulty. It has placed responsibility for certain acts upon servants of the company, such as directors, the secretary and other officials directly. Examples of that can be found in the Companies Act. The Act says, not that a company shall do so and so, but that the company and the directors and the secretary shall do so and so. The other way the law has got over these acts of omission is to say that if the company does not do such and such an act or commits an offence of any kind, then the directors, the secretary and other officials of the company shall be guilty unless they prove to the contrary. I emphasise that this Clause and all the other Clauses say that the guilt of the company must be proved before the Clause comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are much older examples than those given by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale. For example, Section 75 and other Sections of the Coal Mines Act, 1911, provide that if certain regulations are not observed the owner, the manager, the agent and other persons shall be liable unless they prove their innocence. There is the same thing in the Merchant Shipping Act, where the loading provisions provide that the owner shall be liable unless he proves that he was innocent. There are other examples in more recent Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest it is perfectly reasonable not only that this impersonal person, a company, should be liable for its deeds and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1137</span>
misdeeds, but that those responsible for the government of the company, namely, the directors and others, should be liable also. It is a pure fiction of our law that a company is a separate 	<i>persona.</i> On these grounds I suggest that the Amendment, if it is to be pressed, should be negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of intervening this morning, particularly after the excellent explanation of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Erroll), but I am very disappointed with the speech of the Solicitor-General for Scotland. My hon. Friend quoted some very good precedents and the Solicitor-General replied with two others, but the case of the Coal Mines Act and the Merchant Shipping Act were, in a way, special cases because they involved safety of life. The Coal Mines Act dealt with safety of life and was a very special case, and the Merchant Shipuing Act dealt with the load line—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not the load line. It was the loading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It dealt with the loading of ships. If the cargo shifted, it involved the safety at sea of the whole crew. There is nothing like that here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not covered by any of the matters in the Clause. The constitutional point that a man ought to be considered innocent until he is proved guilty was not met by the Solicitor-General. That is the general principle, and it is only in exceptional cases involving such things as safety of life at sea that the exception to the principle should be allowed. There is no exceptional case in this instance. I hope the Government will reconsider the matter. We on this side of the Committee believe that, even at the risk of insecurity, the liberty of the subject is more important than security. [HON. MEMBERS: "oh."] Maybe hon. Members opposite do not. This is a constitutional and traditional question involving the liberty of the subject, because imprisonment is provided—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Solicitor-General for Scotland did not meet the real point lying behind the Amendment in the precedent which he quoted. I am sure that nobody on the other side of the Committee really likes the principle that a man should be deemed to be guilty until he is proved innocent, which is embodied in the subsection. Under the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Bill, which is before Parliament, exactly the same point arises, and the Government have agreed to reconsider the position in regard to that Bill. Will the Minister agree to reconsider the point in regard to this Bill? If he can assure us that he will give the matter his consideration, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Erroll) will not wish to press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Erroll</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make one or two points while the Minister is considering whether he can undertake to reconsider the matter. The Solicitor-General for Scotland failed altogether to establish any proof of need for the subsection in this Bill. In the earlier precedents, clear proof of need was always established before Parliament was prepared to reverse the onus of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two examples which the Solicitor-General quoted were particularly apposite because, as was pointed out by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Angus, South (Captain Duncan), they involve safety of life, which was considered sufficiently important to justify the reversal of the principle. If we could be given similar justification in the case of this Bill the attitude of the Committee and the House later would be very different indeed. It is plain that no possible proof of need is available; otherwise the Solicitor-General would already have told us about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear an hon. Member remark that we should not worry about it because if the man is innocent he will get off; but that is not the point. The point is that under our law all men are innocent until they are proved to be guilty and not that they have to prove themselves innocent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members who have spoken seem entirely to have lost sight of the fact that the objections complained about do not arise until the company itself is proved guilty. The company itself can only act or fail to act through its directors, secretaries or other persons. Therefore, while in law the commission may be the act of the company, it is in fact the act of commission of the director or other persons in the company. Accordingly, if it is an act of commission, one can proceed directly against the person who committed the act in addition to the company.

The difficulty arises in the case of an act of omission, such as in the case of returns and things of that kind. While it may be the duty of a director or secretary of the company, under the articles or an internal arrangement, to make that return, one cannot proceed against him in the criminal courts on that ground. For that reason alone I suggest the rejection of the Amendment. Secondly, there are other precedents which I did not quote but which are available, including various precedents under the nationalisation Acts; and, thirdly, this is our point of principle and, accordingly, I am unwilling to reconsider the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support what has been said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Law). If it is the case that the Government have agreed to reconsider an exactly similar point in connection with the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Bill, would it not be wise for the Government to satisfy themselves on this point? We do not want to legislate in one direction in one Bill when at the same time the Government are legislating in another way on another Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I agree that before the subsection operates, the company has to be found guilty, but will the Solicitor-General read the subsection? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…every person who…was a director, general manager, secretary or other similar officer…shall be deemed to be guilty…"</p></blockquote>
It says "every person." The Solicitor-General for Scotland spoke about "the person." Take the case of the Arbroath Fishermen's Association in my constituency.It is an ordinary fishermen's co-operative association—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a limited company. All the directors and the secretary and the skippers of the ships would automatically be found guilty under this provision because the subsection speaks of "every person." This provision should be reconsidered, and it should be made clear that, having found the company guilty, one can then, if one likes, find guilty the person who is responsible for the negligence of the company. It is quite wrong that every person should be presumed to be guilty until he proves his innocence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hector Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members opposite are overlooking the opening words of the subsection, particularly the hon. Member who has just addressed us. Those words are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a body corporate is guilty of an offence."</p></blockquote>
Those are the servants of that body corporate and there is an onus on them to dissociate themselves from the guilt which is the guilt of the body corporate to which they are attached. That is in no way an infringement of the general principle that a citizen is innocent until he is found guilty. It attaches to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a director, general manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate."</p></blockquote>
That does not infringe the general principle and I hope the Amendment will fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first answer is that we are dealing with this Bill, but I understand that in the Committee on the other Bill the matter is being reconsidered with a view to bringing the Clause into line with the Clause in this Bill; that is, with the idea of stiffening the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One of the great difficulties we have had in our business is to see that in respect of all the written instructions, inspection and supervision which take place, some unfortunate junior who is a member of the staff does not slip up and commit a breach of the regulations. When that happens the employers are responsible and it applies not only to acts of commission, but also to acts of omission. Therefore, if a manager of a remote branch were to fail on some particular occasion to render a return to the Food Office, for example, under the Clause as it stands now, every director of any of the businesses with which I am concerned would be deemed guilty.

	<p>within the memory of hon. Members of the Committee. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Angus, South (Captain Duncan) has mentioned one in Arbroath and there is one in my constituency at Pittenweem. No doubt this idea will spread.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good laughing about this; probably those hon. Members who laugh know nothing about it. By the way, is a co-operative society a corporate body or not? [An HON.

I would have thought that from the Government's point of view, if they want co-operative societies extended, they ought to alter these words and provide for "other person," "the person" or "some person." If the Government refuse to look at that point they are being unreasonable and I do not know how we can be co-operative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment is one of very great importance, but it is in the first place intended to be exploratory, and it is only if the results of the exploration turn out to be unsatisfactory that I shall have to bother the Committee with detailed arguments in support of the Amendment. We are anxious to know in the first place what is meant by "parts of white fish" in page 19, line 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister is aware, there are, at any rate, two very considerable industries which are in a sense dependent on the fishing industry in that they use the by-products of that industry. I refer to the fish meal industry and to the cod liver oil industry. It seems to us that these industries, especially the cod liver oil industry, are separate activities from the fishing industry. It would be unsuitable for the Authority to have them within its purview. I do not think that anybody wants to burden the Authority with more work than it has to do already; and to give it general authority over the cod liver oil industry would burden it too much. It would only have the effect of crippling the cod liver oil industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Thomas Williams)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first question is that the definition itself seems to be clear enough to exclude either cod liver oil or fish meal or any other processed parts of fish. The words "parts of white fish" in line 12, mean parts of a fish or a fillet: that, and nothing else. The Amendment is unnecessary at this point since the words "white fish," wherever referred to in the Bill, mean white fish. There are several references to it, on page 3, line 12; page 3, line 22; and again in Clause 5. Wherever the words "white fish" are used, that simply means fish in the generally accepted sense, but not other processed parts of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Law</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That means, in effect, that the cod liver oil industry would be excluded from the purview of the Authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1144</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It means that cod liver oil would be excluded from this part of the definition. The Clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"white fish' means fish (whether fresh or preserved) of any kind found in the sea, except
	<ol>
	<li>herring;</li>
	<li>any of the salmon species."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Later it states that references to white fish shall be construed as including reference to parts of white fish. There is no point in the Amendment, since processed parts of white fish are not included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Law</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the explanation that the Amendment does not in any way alter the meaning of the Clause as it stands, I ask leave—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want there to be any misunderstanding. Later I have to make a correction as a result of a reply I gave earlier to the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie). I am replying only to the Amendment on the Order Paper when I give the reply that this does not include processed by-products. But there could be other cases where a reference is made to the white fish industry, which is a different matter. If under Clause 4 or Clause 6 the Authority were obliged temporarily, when they had possession of a boat or boats, to fish with those trawlers until they could make other arrangements, obviously it might be necessary to have power to deal with fish meal. That would apply only in such circumstances as Clause 4 or Clause 6 permit, but not here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Law</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I understand the point. It is that, as far as this phrase about the definition of parts of white fish is concerned, my Amendment does not alter the position at all. As the Minister has made that clear, perhaps I should make it clear to him that if I withdraw this Amendment it is only on this point that I am, so to speak, giving way, and that if I should have an opportunity at a later stage to raise other points connected with this question, I should not feel debarred from doing so.

	<div class='title'>—(FISHERY HARBOURS.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that in the case of a local Act divided into Parts the said subsection (1) shall not apply to any of the Parts which does not relate to the matters referred to in that subsection."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps it would be convenient to discuss this and the next two Amendments at the same time. Clause 21 is designed to put right two matters arising from the Fishery Harbours Act, 1915, under which it was intended to transfer to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries responsibility for all small fishery harbours in England and Wales, but that was not completely achieved by that Act. The 1915 Act leaves uncertain what is a small fishery harbour. Clause 21 makes that transparently clear. But in trying to deal with these points we find that our drafting has not been ultra-perfect. Therefore, these three Amendments are designed to put right any defect which there may have been in the original drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause as I propose that it should be amended defines a fishery harbour, and provides for transfer of general responsibility from one Minister to the other when a harbour becomes or ceases to be a fishery harbour. In other words, a harbour may be under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries at this moment but, because of certain changes that take place. it must be transferred perhaps to the Ministry of Transport. The Clause as amended will give the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries the duty of confirming all bylaws and general administrative responsibility, except in matters allotted to the Minister of Transport. It gives the Minister of Transport, in relation to a fishery harbour, responsibility for navigational matters, including powers relating to the harbour wholly or partly below high water mark, safety and guidance of shipping, lifeboats and lifesaving equipment, and the coastguard, responsibility for railways, and right of entry to enforce the Merchant Shipping Acts.

I hope that, now we have tried to make the Clause do just what we set out to do, hon. Members will feel disposed to accept these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see your difficulty, Mr. Butcher. You have suggested that the long title might have to be amended in order to make it quite clear that it is competent for us to insert the Clause into the Bill. We had understood that there was some good precedent for this action in the Act of 1938, but I accept your advice and we shall amend the long title if this Clause is added to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Clause is to amend the 1907 Act which provides that there shall not in any circumstance be more than one whaler attached to any whaling station in Scotland, unless the whaling station existed before 1907 and had more than one whaler at that date. The reason for that limitation which applied to Scotland, and to no other country in the world so far as I know, was that certain herring fishermen, in particular the Shetland fishermen, believed that whaling was seriously detrimental to herring fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although inquiries were made at the time by an advisory committee and although a good deal of scientific research has been made, and the fears expressed from time to time since 1907 have never been seen by the scientists to be at all justified, the limitation was imposed in 1907 and has continued ever since. We have never had many whaling stations in Scotland, and there were none at all from 1929 until a new company revived operations at the whaling station at Bunaveneader in Harris in June last year. They have pointed out that they are quite unable to carry on their activities while the limitation im-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1149</span>
posed in the 1907 Act continues. We think that they have made out a case for additional whalers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause merely provides that, after making proper inquiries—"due inquiry" the Clause says—the Secretary of State will be empowered to permit any whaling company with a whaling station to use more than one whaler in connection with that station, up to a maximum of four. I understand that four is about the normal number used by whaling stations in different parts of Europe. We think it is a fair ceiling to apply in this case. In any case, it is obvious that we must have permission for the company to use more than one whaler.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not objecting to the Clause, but I merely wish to ask, as the Government seem to contemplate that it may be desirable to amend the long title of the Bill, what will happen to the short title?

There is no doubt that the herring hog breaks up the shoals of herring in a way which on occasions has proved useful to fishermen. Secondly, the stench and mess made on the mainland by the whaling stations is a very longstanding grievance, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Robertson) will confirm. I think that in any decision to increase the number of whalers full account should be taken of the genuine objections of the fishermen.

been a certain amount of curiosity about what they will catch, because those who move in those Northern waters know that there are very few whales to be seen, except the Caa'ing whale, which is of very little use from a whaling point of view. There has been a certain amount of suspicion here, which I do not want to increase in any way. It has been suggested that they may not be going to catch whales at all but may be reduced to catching seals or even to going out after certain birds, such as the gannet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a very considerable amount of anxiety amongst naturalists about the effect that may have. I do not want to stress the point, but merely to ask that, if licences are given for whaling in the north of Scotland at a time when there are very few whales about, we shall be sure that the Authority will look very carefully into all the applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was approached by the instigators of the experiment concerned to take this up with the Scottish Office, although the attention of my right hon. Friend had been drawn to it by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan). All this Clause seeks to do, as far as I know, is to give to the whaling company in Scotland the right to operate up to three whaling vessels. Under the 1907 Act they were prevented from using more than one. That is the handicap placed upon this firm—a handicap which no other country places upon its whaling companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we seek to do in the Clause is to give this firm operating in Scotland similar rights to those enjoyed by any other firm operating in any other country. I think I shall be expressing at least my personal thanks and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles to the Secretary of State when I thank him for agreeing to put down this Clause to give this right to a firm which is showing some enterprise in the northern parts of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Law</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 24, line 24, to leave out "such."

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1950-1951V000P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
I understand that we are to discuss with this Amendment the following Amendment in my name, in page 24, line 25, leave out from "interest," to "and," in line 28, and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the white fish industry."</p></blockquote>
I do not think there will be any disagreement with the general proposition that it is most desirable that the members of the White Fish Authority should be entirely independent and should have no financial or commercial interest in the industry of a kind which might influence their judgment. The proposition is, of course, already embodied in paragraph 4 of the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general principle that a member of the Authority should not have any financial or commercial interest is qualified by the words I propose should be left out. I do not quite see who is to judge whether a member of the Authority who has a financial interest has such an interest as will not prejudice his judgment. Be that as it may, we must realise that in an industry like this, where there are many conflicting interests, a member of the Authority who is financially interested, even if we all agree that his interest is not likely to prejudice his judgment, will be an object of some suspicion and mistrust, particularly among those whose interests may be affected by what the White Fish Authority does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Government will feel disposed to accept this Amendment, and to admit that nobody having a financial interest should hold any position on the Authority. It might be argued that by excluding in that rigorous way anybody who has a commercial or financial interest we shall be limiting the field of experience of the Authority as a whole. I do not myself think there is much in that argument, because all that kind of experience can be obtained from the Advisory Council and from the advisers to the Authority. It is essential that the members of the Authority should be above suspicion of any kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope this Amendment will not be pressed. There really is not a great deal in it. The Ministers will take good care not to have on the board people having financial or commercial interests of a size and of a particular kind as to make it impossible for them to be regarded as impartial independent mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
bers of the board. On the other hand, if in addition to leaving out the word "such" we insert the suggested words, the effect clearly will be to make it very difficult to get the people that we shall need to have a really good board. Insertion of these words would rule out a person with a very small shareholding in perhaps a co-operative association, or something of that kind, or in a fish retail business; somebody with a small shareholding on the very fringe of the industry would be caught in the very small mesh net which the right hon. Gentleman wishes us to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said he could not see who would judge whether a holding would be likely to impair a man's ability to carry out his duties. The answer to that is in paragraph 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Ministers to satisfy themselves"</p></blockquote>
We think that if we leave it like that there will be no difficulty. If we try to make it tighter we shall not make the position any better than it already is, but may make it so tight that a very good chap will be caught in the net when we did not intend him to be caught at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That this be the First Schedule to the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take this opportunity, if I may, to correct a statement I made at our last meeting in reply to a question by the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. Duthie), who asked whether the power to divert a vessel from one port to another would be part and parcel of the regulations. I am afraid I fell into the error of saying "Yes." It may be possible that timing regulations would, in some cases, lead to a diversion, and of course the wide powers under Clause 6 would enable the Authority to bring in a scheme for diversion. I therefore want to make it transparently clear, to the hon. Gentleman for Banff in particular and to the Committee in general, that regulations under Clause 5 could not provide for compulsory diversion from one port to another, though a scheme can be introduced under Clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we might discuss at the same time the next Amendment: in line 24, leave out "twenty-eight" and insert "fifty-six." The object of these Amendments is quite clear and I do not wish to take up time on them. We merely wish to extend the period, because in an industry of this kind, which is a very complicated one scattered all over the country, it is felt that 28 days does not give a great deal of time for consideration or consultation and that 56 days would be an improvement. At any rate, that is the view which I suggest to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not press this point. It is not only 28 days as the Bill stands. There is the inquiry of all the various interests before the Authority comes forward with its public announcement of the intention to make a regulation; there is then the 28 days; there is the subsequent inquiry if objections are made, and then there is approval by Parliament, which will take a month. The time will add up in total to several months from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, when the white fish industry got into great difficulty, it was necessary to move very quickly indeed. If the Authority had to face a similiar situation in future it might well find even the present time limit hampering, and if we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
double it we shall only be adding to the difficulty. I think the right hon. Gentleman will agree that is probably so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
