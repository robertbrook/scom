	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymeade and Weybridge</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that when we adjourned before lunch, no one had spoken to the clause and that the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley) intended to speak to it. I have a couple of simple questions about costs. Will the Minister or the hon. Lady tell us the Department's estimated cost of complying with the legislation? I realise that the checks carried out by the Department and the access to the list that it will make available mirror the service that the Department already provides, but it is anticipated that there will be a substantial increase in the number of applications for information from the list and I assume that the Department has estimated the cost of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeal tribunal that is to be set up will incur costs, and I cannot see in the documents any estimate of those costs. The Minister will be unable to give accurate figures, but it would help if he gave the Committee an indication of the order of magnitude of the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, those matters are dealt with in the regulatory impact assessment that accompanied the Bill, and were the subject of a short debate on the money resolution about two weeks ago. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what the additional running costs are likely to be, but we estimate that approximately £500,000 will be needed for the extra cost of the appeal tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any additional running costs will have to be met from the Department's existing budget, but I cannot state in pounds, shillings and pence the additional cost of administering the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 12</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>INTERPRETATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 8, line 13, leave out "18" and insert "16".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply want to ask my hon. Friend why 18 was used in the definition of "child". There are some hulks of 16 or 17 who would not like to be described as children and it seems particularly inappropriate to describe a married couple as children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Debra Shipley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stourbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment. The Bill provides protection for all children and a child is defined in the Children Act 1989 as a person aged under 18. There can be no justification for not applying the protection afforded by the Bill to all children up to that age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition is also consistent with other legislation, in particular the Police Act 1997, which allows criminal checks to be made by the criminal records bureau in relation to positions involving regular caring for, or training, supervising, or being in sole charge of, persons under the age of 18. That is also consistent with the stance that has been adopted by the interdepartmental working group, which is seeking to prevent unsuitable people from working with children and which recommends an integrated system of vetting and checks in relation to children up to the age of 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The age of 18 is also consistent with the European convention on human rights, which defines a child as a person who is under 18. That definition has also been used by the convention on the rights of the child. It would therefore be undesirable, and probably inappropriate, not to extend the Bill's protections to all children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge may be interested to learn that we are broadly trying to align the list that we maintain in the Department of Health with the list that is maintained by the Department for Education and Employment. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment uses a similar age limit in relation to List 99—the DFEE scheme refers to a person who has not attained the age of 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons—as well as those that were given by my hon. Friend—we agree that the Bill should make provision for children up to the age of 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of those statements, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 8, leave out lines 18 and 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may consider amendment No. 61, in page 8, line 20, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) which may be prescribed by the Secretary of State in regulations to be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should stress that the amendment and that which is grouped with it are not complementary—they are alternative methods of probing the Bill's intentions. We should also establish whether there is a case for going further in the direction that the amendments suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 would delete clause 12(1)(b), which defines a child care organisation in relation to those bodies.
	<br><blockquote><p>"whose activities are regulated by or by virtue of any prescribed enactment".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
If paragraph (b) were deleted, child care organisations would be defined in relation to those bodies that are
	<br><blockquote><p>"concerned with the provision of accommodation, social services or health care services to children or the supervision of children".</p></blockquote>
Other conditions will have to be fulfilled before a body can qualify as a child care organisation, but such organisations will not be confined to those bodies that are regulated by statute. I am sure that the hon. Member for Stourbridge appreciates that the amendment would greatly widen the Bill's scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suppose for one minute that the hon. Lady is minded to accept the amendment, and I shall not press it to a Division. However, we must recognise the limits that the Bill imposes. Its requirement that child care organisations should be regulated by statute may involve an arbitrary distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the proposals were confined to regulated child care organisations. The mandatory parts of the Bill will apply to those organisations, but the Bill will also apply to other organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to point that out. The Bill states that any body can make a reference to the Secretary of State, and registered persons are not confined to statutory bodies. Responsible child care organisations that are not regulated by statute should have no difficulty acting under the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example that was drawn to my attention was that of the Association of Recognised English Language Services. It is not responsible for all organisations in the English language school community. As a trade body, it works on behalf of its members, which operate in a recognised and responsible manner. Although organisations that are not its members do not necessarily act irresponsibly, the Association of Recognised English Language Services sets standards for its members. It will, I am sure, expect them to make references to the Secretary of State and to seek references, but that will not be true for all bodies. Some organisations that have charge of children will not provide references when they should, and others—including the individuals who work for them—will not request the necessary references.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much compulsion can we include to regulate other organisations? I do not intend to pick and choose. Amendment No. 48 exposes the fact that compulsion applies only to the statutory regulated sector. Beyond that, it is up to the discretion of organisations, the great majority of which will comply in a responsible way—but not all will do so. Amendment No. 61 has a different purpose. It is designed to allow the Secretary of State to prescribe, by way of affirmative resolution in the House, other bodies that are to be included as child care organisations. Amendment No. 61 is my preferred amendment, subject to the terms of the debate. I hope that the hon. Member for Stourbridge agrees that it would provide an opportunity to use what is a flexible power to extend the scope of the mandatory provisions beyond those bodies that are regulated by enactments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
We should consider what will happen when bodies that are covered by enactments move out of regulation. That is axiomatic for an Opposition who believe in deregulation. Bodies that are regulated by statute might not be regulated in the future for reasons that are outwith the responsibilities in the Bill. Although we hope that they would continue to meet the requirements, they would no longer be under a compulsion to do so. A move outwith the Bill's requirements might act as a constraint against deregulation. The power in amendment No. 61 would allow a deregulatory provision to be accompanied by a protecting regulation so that an organisation continued to be subject to the Bill's mandatory provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can feel my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) looking at me and worrying that I am proposing to give the Secretary of State another broad and sweeping power, which he would want to oppose. I hope that the Minister will share his view on the extent to which such a power might be used profitably by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that I was not giving him such a look. Correspondence that I received from voluntary organisations expressed concern about the Berlin wall that is being erected between the regulated and the non-regulated sector. Does he agree that we are heading dangerously towards the pitfall of trying to make comprehensive a measure that we have all acknowledged cannot be comprehensive? If we try to make it cover every situation—which it cannot do—we may create a weaker measure. Does my hon. Friend accept that it might be better to start with the measure narrowly defined, as drafted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point, which is why I suspect that amendment No. 48 would go much too far at this stage. However, amendment No. 61 has merit, because it is a flexible provision that would allow us to move in that direction, subject to the agreement of the House, in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would add to the argument in favour of amendment No. 61 the fact that responsible bodies who comply with this legislation might incur additional costs in the process of so doing. They would not begrudge those costs, as they would be incurring them in order to discharge their responsibilities towards children responsibly. However, others who do not comply might be able to operate with lower costs, and hence obtain an inappropriate advantage. It would, therefore, be possible to create a level playing field between such organisations, and in the process ensure a greater degree of protection for children, if we were to allow for subsequent regulations to add further child care organisations, as amendment No. 61 proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have moved amendment No. 48, but I reserve my position both to seek leave to withdraw it, subject to the outcome of the debate, and to move on to amendment No. 61 if there is support for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) made a valuable contribution, and he is right about the limitations of this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
private Member's Bill in terms of the organisations that its umbrella covers. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is right to point out that the Bill is necessarily limited. It is a building block: it had to start and stop somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48, in conjunction with amendment No. 61, would require regulations specifying which organisations are included in the mandatory provision to be made by affirmative procedure. The proposals would not impose the same requirement as the existing provision that the organisations' activities be regulated in some way. As such, it would remain open for a wider group of organisations to be covered than is anticipated by the Bill, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire acknowledged. The activities of those organisations could not be controlled, nor sanctions be imposed for non-compliance—an important aspect of the Bill. In the context of the obligations that would be imposed, it is not appropriate to extend the provisions any wider than the Bill proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to make the point that, if one set out to impose obligations on organisations that are not already the subject of statutory regulation, one would have to have all the encumbrances that go with it to compel those organisations either to follow the legislation or to suffer penalties. I remember from other Bills how much that can add to the burden of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the hon. Lady's point, and on those grounds I shall seek leave to withdraw the amendment, while putting on record that this may be a matter that we need to return to at a later stage. I hope that we shall not have to, because I hope that we shall not have the kind of mischief in future for which this would be an appropriate remedy. If we do, we shall have to legislate, with all the penalties and offences that go with that, to extend these provisions to the non-statutory sector. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 8, line 24, at end insert ", or".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment would change the definition of a child care position to give greater emphasis to the post than the organisation. Therefore, the definition would include volunteers who do not always have supervision but who have regular contact with children in the course of their duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is apparently minor, in that it would add only the word, "or". However, its inclusion would greatly strengthen the protection that the Bill will give to children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment. Subject to subsection (3), subsection (1)(a), under the definition of "child care position", defines such a position as one
	<br><blockquote><p>"which is concerned with the provision of accommodation, social services or health care services to children or the supervision of children".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (1)(b), under the same definition, further defines a child care position as one that
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"is such as to enable the holder to have regular contact with children in the course of his duties".</p></blockquote>
A child care position is therefore one that relates clearly to the provision of child care services and, as such, will deliberately exclude workers from a range of other occupations who, although they may have regular contact with children, are not in positions of trust as envisaged by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the intentions behind the amendment, but its terms are much wider than the aims of the Bill. I am not sure who the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) hopes the amendment would cover by making paragraphs (a) and (b) disjunctive rather than conjunctive, but I imagine that, for example, it would cover a sales assistant in a toy shop. If so, the scope of the amendment is indeed too wide. Moreover, given that the hon. Lady has not sought also to amend the definition of a child care Organisation, the amendment would fail to achieve its aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's definition of a child care organisation will constrain interpretation of the application of clause 7, which refers to the circumstances in which a child care organisation offers an individual employment in a child care position. Unless the definition of a child care organisation is also amended, the amending of the definition of a child care position would fail to achieve the hon. Lady's objective as I understand it. Notwithstanding that technical point, the amendment would bring into the net far more people than should reasonably be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, when considering a Bill such as this, we tend to strive for perfection by seeking to make it as all-embracing and effective as possible. However, we must recognise that the provision is a limited one that deals with only part of the problem. If we are to ensure that it works, we should not seek to broaden it unreasonably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stourbridge talked about capturing people in positions of trust. In referring to positions of trust, she herself used too narrow a definition. We are dealing with people in supervisory positions or positions of care. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the amendment would cover sales assistants working in toy shops. Certainly, that is not the intention behind the amendment. I accept that it would cast the net too widely, but I am not convinced that the Bill, as it is drafted, will cast the net sufficiently widely to encompass people who have regular contact with children in spheres other than, say, commerce. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 8, line 43, after "functioning", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or a state of diminished mental capacity resulting from degenerative illness which includes a significant loss of social functioning or capacity of expression."</p></blockquote>
This is a small amendment that would extend the definition of mental impairment in clause 12 to deal with a matter to which I referred this morning in relation to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
clause 10. Clause 10 gives the Secretary of State the power to extend its provisions from children to adults who, through mental impairment, exhibit some of the characteristics of vulnerability of children. Under the definition of mental impairment in the Bill, only those adults whose mental development had been impaired or who had suffered learning difficulties would be covered by any extension under clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Stourbridge took on board the suggestion of various hon. Members—from both sides of the House—that, if the provision were to be extended at some stage to the vulnerable elderly, it should be drafted as widely as possible to catch as many cases as possible. The defining characteristic is vulnerability caused by a state of mental awareness, mental agility and social functioning that is not fully developed as a result of some learning disability or that has declined as a result of a degenerative mental disorder of the type that—sadly—is all too familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped—I qualify my remarks, as I am conscious that the Minister may tell me at any moment that I have done something different—that the amendment would extend the definition of mental impairment so that, if the Secretary of State were minded at any stage to extend the Bill's provisions to cover the vulnerable elderly with impaired mental faculties, it would include those suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease, for example, as well as those suffering from learning disabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to the comments made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. On Second Reading, I said—in relation to the vulnerable elderly—that I had received representations, which included some harrowing examples. I noted with considerable sadness that the vulnerable elderly were outside the scope of my Private Member's Bill. In my less exhausted moments, when I wander up and down the Corridor, I think to myself that that is exactly the area that I would tackle were I to come top of next year's ballot for Private Members' Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sympathetic to the apparent purpose of the amendment, but I regret that I must reject it. As I understand it, the intention of the amendment is to allow the definition of mental impairment to include an additional category of people suffering from degenerative disorders such as dementia, to whom the protection of the Bill could be extended under an order made in clause 10. The amendment therefore raises—in a new way—the issue of extending the Bill's protection to vulnerable adults, which the Committee has already discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons I have given, the Bill is not an appropriate vehicle for such a change, however desirable it may be in principle. The Bill is targeted on improving the child protection system. It would not be practicable to expect that system to encompas satisfactorily the needs of a distinct group of vulnerable adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that clause 10 envisages extending protection to mentally impaired adults, but they are the one adult group whose position is most similar to that of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have great sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge has made a good case for why the Bill may not be the appropriate vehicle to address the hon. Gentleman's concerns about a particular group of vulnerable adults. He will be aware—as, I am sure, will the whole Committee—that a new interdepartmental ministerial group is currently considering policy in relation to preventing unsuitable adults from having contact with children. We also intend to ensure that the group examines the case of vulnerable adults. I assure the Committee that I shall ensure that the interdepartmental group of Ministers is made aware of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman expressed. We shall have to await the conclusion of the ministerial group's work to discover the best way to proceed. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge that the Bill is not the best vehicle for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am naturally disappointed by the comments of the hon. Member for Stourbridge and the Minister. I would have great sympathy with the argument that the intention behind an extension was good but the Bill was not the appropriate vehicle for it, if the Bill did not already include clause 10. The hon. Lady said that the Bill was not the appropriate vehicle for an extension, but she made no case for that assertion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend gave an explanation. The group of adults to which we can extend the list under clause 10 has been specifically chosen and included in the overall scope of the Bill because the people concerned are most similar to vulnerable children. The adults to whom the hon. Gentleman refers—those who suffer from Alzheimer's and other degenerative conditions—do not have broadly similar needs to those of the vulnerable children whom we have in range when we discuss the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not claim to be expert on degenerative mental disorders, but elderly people who develop mental impairment and those who suffer from degenerative diseases that involve loss of social functioning have many attributes in common. It would be odd if clause 10 were brought into force and form of apartheid were to exist between different groups of vulnerable adults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are other vulnerable adults whom we need to consider—those who have lost, not their mental capacity, but their physical capacity to defend themselves. Surely, when my hon. Friend the Minister examines the matter, he should consider that group as well. We should not isolate those who have lost mental capacity from those who have lost the physical capacity to protect themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with what the hon. Lady says; she is entirely right. I was seeking to extend the definition as far as possible within the constraints of the Bill. That is why I sought only to consider comparable loss of social and mental functioning.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
I understand the argument that is being made. The import of the Minister's comments is probably that it may not be necessary for the Secretary of State to bring clause 10 into force because events will overtake it if the work that the Government are doing on measures to protect vulnerable adults is brought into effect reasonably speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little disappointed by what has been said, but we have aired the issue. I accept entirely that the Minister intends, within the broader remit of the Department's considerations, to address the issue of the type of vulnerable elderly people whom I had in mind. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 9, leave out lines 15 to 17 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) On the first occasion on which regulations are made under this Act they shall be subject to affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament, and any further regulations shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote>
Although you have not grouped amendment No. 33 with this amendment, Mr. O'Brien, I hope that you will at least allow me to make a brief reference to it. If I get really good assurances from my hon. Friends the Member for Stourbridge and the Minister, I might not need to move amendment No. 33 later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are about not trusting Ministers, which is a good, simple principle. A Minister should never be trusted. The good ones get promoted, and the bad ones are happy to break their word. That is the trouble with the Bill—it leaves a great deal to the good will of the Minister. Ministers always assure Committees that they will do all of the best things, but in practice they often do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will complete its consideration of the Bill fairly soon today. It will then go back to the Floor of the House and on to the House of Lords. Then it will disappear into a sort of black hole, while the Department decides how to produce the regulations. The problem is this: will it produce all the regulations at the same time? The Bill allows different parts of the Bill to be introduced at different times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember sitting in Committee a long time ago, considering the Bill that became the Children Act 1975. Hon. Members spent hours arguing about getting the balance of the provisions just right. When the Bill moved on, we were satisfied that the balance was right. Now, more than 20 years later, some of the permissive bits that were to be introduced by regulations have not been brought into force. The balance of the legislation was to some extent damaged by selective decisions to bring into force different parts of it at different times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give the Committee a clear undertaking on when his Department will introduce the legislation? I expect my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge to be more sympathetic to amendment No. 33, which proposes that all the legislation should come into force with Royal Assent. I understand that Ministers never like such provisions, which give them a timetable that they have to keep to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
I should like most of all to hear an assurance that the whole of the legislation will come into force in one go, and that the time of its introduction will be clear. A further safeguard would be proper debate in the House, which would ensure that everybody outside knew when the legislation would take effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would permit regulations to be made by affirmative resolution the first time that they are made, and thereafter by negative resolution. It would be inappropriate to make the regulations associated with the Bill in such a manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12(4) provides that regulations made under the Bill be made by negative resolution. The amendment would mean that the first time that regulations were made, they would be made by affirmative resolution. Affirmative resolutions are traditionally associated with, and reserved for, controversial and contentious issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And important things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill received a warm welcome from both sides of the House on Second Reading and a similar welcome in Committee. In light of that response, I hope that hon. Members will accept that the provisions, which are intended to enhance the protection afforded to children, contain nothing to warrant use of the affirmative resolution procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill in principle has enjoyed a good measure of support from both sides of the House, as the hon. Lady said. The Opposition will none the less look carefully at the regulations, whether they are subject to affirmative or negative resolution. We will seek to pray against them to enable a debate in Standing Committee if we consider it appropriate to do so, and if they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Minister's explanation of the Bill. Such action would be right and proper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What proportion of the prayers put down by the Opposition during the current Parliament have actually resulted in debates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can speak only from my own experience. Since I became responsible, on behalf of the official Opposition, for dealing with statutory instruments relating to health and social services, every time that we have prayed against a measure and sought a debate our request has been granted. I have no complaints on that score.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost reluctant to intervene in the debate. I have obviously said something to offend my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). I am not sure what it is, because I have tried throughout the Committee's proceedings to be as open as possible with my hon. Friend and other members of the Committee. We certainly have nothing to hide and no secret agenda. I hope that my hon. Friend will accept those assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has a technical problem, which I should bring to the Committee's attention. It would specify an affirmative resolution procedure in relation to the regulations that the Department of Health, will need to establish when the consultancy index becomes a statutory list. The list maintained by my right hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the associated regulations are subject to the negative resolution procedure. The consequence of the amendment would therefore be to separate—to establish a divorce, as it were—between the regulations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not quite correct. Those regulations are already in place. The amendment refers only to the first occasion on which regulations are passed. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to tell the Committee the timetable for laying down the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is none the less still valid. It is perfectly possible that further regulations will be made under the scheme maintained by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. Under the Education Reform Act 1988, which is the relevant statute in that case, there is a negative resolution procedure. It would be unwise, and inconsistent with the practice of this House, to create a situation, perhaps inadvertently, whereby the regulatory procedures were different in relation to the same subject matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a compelling reason, which I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) is able to take on board. I believe that he is pressing me largely in respect of amendment No. 33, which the Committee has not yet discussed. As I hope that members of the Committee will understand, I am not in a position today to give a precise date on which the regulations will be laid before the House. It would not be reasonable to expect me to respond to that question today. We have made it clear that we want to introduce the legislation as quickly as we can in a way that is compatible with the need to ensure that everyone is fully aware of the obligations that will be created under the Bill when it is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister confirm that he does not intend to introduce different parts of it on different dates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend, that is probably more in the realm of amendment No. 33 than of amendment No. 32. I am not sure that I can give him that assurance. I tried to be clear about the matter on Second Reading. I do not have my speech to hand, but I am sure that I can let my hon. Friend have a copy. I tried on that occasion to share with the House our thinking about how the Bill would need to be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, quite properly, and fully in accordance with the normal way in which legislation is enacted, reserved the power to introduce parts of the Bill separately when it is enacted. That is the most sensible way to proceed, as it is with many other pieces of legislation. For example, we shall obviously need to ensure that the appeal tribunal is properly established before other important provisions come into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a matter of common sense, and it is one of the reasons why, when we debate amendment No. 33, I shall have to express my opposition to it. In doing so, and in trying to be open and honest with the Committee, I am also trying to make it clear that the flexibility that we are,
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
reasonably, asking for is not to do with any intention to confuse or to introduce the Bill in an underhand way; exactly the opposite is the case. It is the most effective way of introducing the legislation sensibly and in a planned and orderly fashion. That is perfectly consistent with the way in which most of the law that we make in this House is ultimately enacted. There is nothing qualitatively different about the Bill that necessitates every clause coming into effect on day one; obviously, that is not our intention. But I am afraid that I cannot be specific about dates, for obvious reasons which I hope that all Committee members will, with good will, appreciate and understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very disappointing answer. Ministers usually manage to come up with vague phrases such as "the winter of or "the summer of. For my hon. Friend to say merely that he cannot tell us is not good enough—we could wait five years. That would be totally unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is giving a worst-case scenario and placing the worst interpretation on my remarks. Given that I made it clear that we intend to introduce the legislation as quickly as we possibly can, I do not believe that my hon. Friend's interpretation is in any way justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that means that the legislation might be in place by the end of the winter. It is important that the Minister considers the advantages of committing himself to a timetable. People always think that they can tweak regulations and find ways of improving them slightly. If the Minister said that they had to be available by the end of the winter—which is not unreasonable—it would strengthen Ministers' hands and ensure that this protection was in place as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was very worrying to hear the Minister say that some provisions would come into play substantially before others. One reason why the series of people outside the House who have reservations about the Bill's civil liberties implications said that they would go along with it was that for the first time, it will give a group of people the right to appeal, which is very important. If, however, the message got out that we might get the list before getting the right to appeal—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to make it clear to my hon. Friend that was not a possibility. The appeal tribunal is fundamental to the Bill; it is not possible to operate the new statutory list until and unless that appeal tribunal is fully in place. I hope that my hon. Friend understands that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. If my hon. Friend would go a little further and say that the legislation would be in place by the end of next winter, I should be satisfied. However, my hon. Friend is not confirming that. Disappointed as I am, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(1B) For the purposes of subsection (1A) above, a reference of an individual for inclusion in that Index is determined only when, following the reference—
	<ol>
	<li>the individual is included (otherwise than provisionally) in the Index; or</li>
	<li>the Secretary of State determines that he should not be included in it.".—[Ms. 	<i>Shipley.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause, which has now been amended by the Committee, makes necessary transitory arrangements to dovetail old provisions with the new. Originally, the clause covered two sets of circumstances. Subsection (1) preserves the ability of organisations to consult the consultancy service index and List 99 without first going through the criminal records bureau, until such time as the one-stop shop set up by clause 8 comes into operation; while subsection (2) makes it clear that it will remain possible to access. List 99 without having to go through the bureau.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has added two new subsections to deal with references made to the consultancy service index that have not been determined before the commencement of clause 2. As the Committee will recall, the effect of the two new subsections is to provide that such cases should be treated as though they were references to the new list under clause 2(i) after the clause is brought into effect. That avoids the duplication that would otherwise arise from having to determine whether the cases should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
included in the old consultancy service index, and then engaging the transfer procedure to the new statutory list under clause 3.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(e) the Tribunal established by section 9 of the Protection of Children Act 1999.'.".—[	<i>Mr. Bennett.</i>]</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would simply ensure that anyone who wanted to appeal to the tribunal against being put on the list could have legal representation. That is a fundamental right: where people's livelihood may be taken away, we should guarantee that they will have legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge is likely to say, "Ah well, that is not the sort of thing that should be included in a Bill such as this. A review of the whole of legal aid is under way under the Lord Chancellor, so it is not appropriate to include such a provision in the Bill." I understand that argument, but in a fundamental case such as this, it would be far better to write the provision into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will at least consider accepting the new clause. I do not suppose that, if it is passed in its present form, the Government will perform a somersault and decide that this small amount of expenditure is absolutely unacceptable. The majority of the people involved will not have a case worth putting to a tribunal, so there will be no reason for them to do so; only a small minority of people will go through the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
tribunal process. To guarantee that they will have the money to pay for legal representation, so that the process is fair, is fundamental natural justice. I hope that even at this stage my hon. Friend will accept that, and that my hon. Friend the Minister will say, "If that is the Committee's wish, the Lord Chancellor will have to go along with it."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say that, inexperienced as I am, I am fairly certain that I have no control whatever over the Lord Chancellor. However, in the spirit of the propositions that my hon. Friend made regarding legal aid, the Government are reviewing legal aid. That was announced to Parliament on 21 January this year, and it would be premature to judge the outcome of that review. A strong case could, however, be made for legal aid with regard to my Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should add one or two thoughts about the new clause that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge rightly drew the Committee's attention to the review of legal aid that the Lord Chancellor announced in another place on 21 January. He made it clear that the Government would conduct a review of funding for legal representation before tribunals. Funding for legal representation in respect of the tribunal that will be set up under the Bill will be considered as part of that review. If the review's findings suggest that it would be appropriate to provide some form of funding for legal representation before the tribunal, an appropriate mechanism will need to be put in place before the relevant provisions of the Bill become operational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should clarify another point for my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and the Committee. We are talking about legal aid, and my hon. Friend made it clear that he wanted legal aid to attach to the tribunal. It needs to be borne in mind that funding for legal representation could be provided by several other means. Those include Government grant to a body or voluntary organisation, which could be made available for appropriate cases. The Home Office, for example, uses that system for funding immigration tribunals, and the Government fund the Immigration Advisory Service for that purpose. Alternatively, some form of direct grant could be considered. I assure the Committee that all appropriate methods of funding in relation to the work of the tribunal will be considered in the review of legal aid. For all the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge gave, it is inappropriate for us to pre-empt the results of the Lord Chancellor's review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish will draw some comfort from what I have said, and not push the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have been concerned about the possibility that individuals might find themselves included on the list and unable to pursue a case to appeal because of lack of funding. If it were not for the current review of legal aid in respect of tribunals, I would strongly support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
Inclusion in the list represents a serious disability. It is incumbent on us to ensure that anyone who is included in it and who feels that he has good grounds for appeal is not denied an appeal because he lacks the financial wherewithal. However, I accept what the Minister said. It seems reasonable to make the case that, in the context of an overall review of the financing of appeals to tribunals, we should rely on the Minister's words and the Government's good will to ensure that appellants to the tribunal are in no worse a position than appellants to tribunals with which we are all familiar, such as employment tribunals. In light of the Minister's comments, I am prepared to watch this space.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to clarify one small point. There are two classes of application to the tribunal: people who appeal against a decision to place them on the list and people who seek the tribunal's decision on a reference to the Secretary of State that has not been determined within nine months. Does the Minister regard those two classes as similar in terms of their eligibility or otherwise for any form of assistance? If so, whatever mechanism is put in place for providing financial assistance to applicants to the tribunal should apply to both classes of applicant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge I would say that I am a little uneasy about trusting Ministers. I am also uneasy about the idea that we can differentiate between the two situations; it is important that legal aid is available in both situations.

I was to a certain extent heartened by what my hon. Friend the Minister said, because he suggested that, even if we do not persuade the Lord Chancellor about the legal aid provisions—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend is nodding his head—he accepts the natural justice argument that it would be wrong for someone to be denied legal representation at the tribunal. That is encouraging. I suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge persuades the Lord Chancellor that it is fundamentally right that people should have that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the tribunal should be on a par with other employment tribunals, but I do not think that it is. Although it may be very distressing for people who have lost jobs to go to an employment tribunal but not get those jobs back, that does not stop them being employed elsewhere. Being on the list would effectively stop someone being employed altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made the point that it should be on a par with other tribunals because I understood the Minister to say that the system of legal aid support for applications to tribunals in general was under review. I would simply seek assurance that appeals to this tribunal would not be disadvantaged in any way merely because it was not established at the time of that review, but I think that the Minister gave that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. If, however, one were to draw up a list of tribunals for which legal aid should be available, this tribunal should be high on that list, because it is essential that legal aid be available for it.

	<div class='title'>FAILURE TO INFORM PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYER OF PRESENCE ON LIST</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>".—(1) Any individual who knows that he is included in the list kept by the Secretary of State under section 1 shall be guilty of an offence if he applies for employment in a child care position but fails to inform his prospective employer that he is on the list.</p>
	<p>(2) Any individual guilty of an offence under subsection (1) above shall be subject to a maximum term of imprisonment of three months.".</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the first time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause was tabled as a means of probing my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge to see whether she might consider a way of including a safeguard in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people whose names are on the list apply to a recognised child care organisation, they will be unable to obtain employment. If, however, they apply to work for other people, they may well be employed. The first time that someone on the list finds employment in a child-minding capacity and then commits a further offence, there will be uproar at the fact that the individual was employed without his employer knowing about his inclusion on the list. There is no mechanism for such employers to find out that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot, of course, have an open list that anyone can consult, but there seems to be merit in saying that if someone who is on the list and knows that he is on the list deliberately applies for a job as a nanny or a post involving looking after children in some other form without telling the employer that he is on the list, he commits an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My proposal would not stop a devious person intent on causing harm to young people, but it might stop some people who have good intentions but sometimes let them fall. We should make it clear to everyone on the list that if they apply for a child care position without telling the people to whom they are applying that they are on the list, they will be committing an offence. That would be some safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that my proposal is not a particularly adequate way of tackling the issue, but this is a problem that the Committee must address. When a list is in place, private individuals who may employ someone in this capacity will be appalled to know that they could unwittingly employ someone who is on the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said. The attraction of the new clause is that it would create an offence where an individual knowingly seeks to set out to deceive someone when it is important that that person should know about the former's presence on the list. It would not be a watertight arrangement, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, but in belt and braces terms it would represent an extra tier of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
I know that the Government are looking at the matter in a broader sense, and I am sure that there would be technical and legal difficulties involved in the measure. However, it is sufficiently superficially attractive for the Minister or the hon. Member for Stourbridge to be required to explain to us in some detail why it is not possible for the Bill to create the offence that the new clause proposes. What prospects are there in the foreseeable future for the creation of such an offence, perhaps in other legislation, in the context of the Government's wider and longer-term programme of measures to protect the vulnerable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is no offence of applying for a post, an obvious gap is evident in the Bill's arrangements. It is also morally wrong for an individual who knows that he is on the list not to be forced to confront that fact every time that he takes a step that brings him into a position of applying for and seeking to take up a child care position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee will listen to the Minister and the hon. Member for Stourbridge with open minds. We should be able to see, somewhere in the not too distant future, the prospect of an offence being created. If that is not to be within the scope of the Bill, we should leave the Committee today with a clear idea of how and when it is likely to come about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As has been said, new clause 2 seeks to create a new criminal offence. The question of criminal offences in relation to individuals working with children is under active consideration by the interdepartmental working group on preventing unsuitable people from working with children. The group has recommended the creation of a new offence of applying for or accepting work with children when deemed unsuitable for such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A copy of the group's report was published on 25 January and is in the Library of the House. The main findings are worth summarising. It recommended an integrated system for identifying people who are unsuitable to work with children in England and Wales; a central access point, or one-stop shop, for the integrated system, which should be the criminal records bureau; and that the integrated system should identify as unsuitable to work with children people who have committed specific criminal offences, are included in the DFEE List 99 for misconduct relating to children or are included in the DH consultancy index as unsuitable to work with children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the working group's report was published, the Home Secretary welcomed it as a basis for a well-thought-out integrated scheme to prevent abusers from working with children, and said that legislative provisions for the one-stop shop should proceed immediately. I am glad to say that the Bill makes those provisions through the amendment to part V of the Police Act 1997 and the establishment of the criminal records bureau as the one-stop shop. The Home Secretary also asked the working group to develop its other recommendations, some of which require consultation, so that the Government can move quickly to introduce further safeguards, including new criminal offences. Those issues require careful consideration, which is why the process that I have outlined is the best way of taking forward the wider agenda and of legislating for criminal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
offences in respect of people who are banned from working with children but seek nevertheless to gain such employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the working group is already well into its further consideration of outstanding issues such as how best to define working with children and the precise forms of work that the integrated scheme should include. It is considering the list of offences that would attract a ban on working with children and whether such a ban should apply automatically on conviction for any such offence. It is also considering the relationship of the integrated scheme to developments in Northern Ireland and Scotland. It is expected to advise on a plan that will help translate the recommendations into direct action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group has been asked to report on all those matters by the summer. The Government will then seek an early opportunity to incorporate the recommendations, including the new criminal offence, into legislation. That legislation will need to be timed with the establishment of the criminal records bureau, which I understand to be scheduled for 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is wide ranging, and relates to employment in any child care position as defined in the Bill. It is not limited to employment by a child care organisation or even to employment by an organisation such as the scouts or a charity. It would apply to any employment that meets the definition of "child care position". That would include employment directly by a parent or an informal leisure or sporting group. The new clause goes far wider than is feasible in terms of the Bill's aims. Until the important working group discussions are concluded, the imposition of criminal sanctions would be premature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DUTY TO INFORM SOCIAL SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>"Whenever the Secretary of State provisionally includes an individual in the list in accordance with section 2(3)(b) above or confirms the inclusion of an individual in the list in accordance with section 2(5) above or removes an individual from the list in accordance with section 1(3) above, he shall, within a period of 30 days after such inclusion, confirmation or removal inform the Social Services Department responsible for the area in which the individual resides of such inclusion, confirmation or removal.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. This morning, my hon. Friend the member for South Cambridgeshire spoke to amendments of his relating to circumstances in which the definition of employment will not stretch far enough. He spoke about host families for foreign language students. The Committee has focused on people whose behaviour has rendered them unsuitable for any employment that gives them access to children or a role in child care as defined in the Bill. We have discussed how, under the Bill, a person can be dismissed from employment and referred to the Secretary of State, who may find it
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
appropriate to place that person on the list. I have tabled the new clause because such a person could continue to look after his or her own children and go home every night to his or her home while the local social services remained blissfully unaware of the Secretary of State's decision. No action would be taken to review whether such a person was an appropriate person to care for his or her own children, stepchildren or children of an unmarried partner with whom he or she lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to formalise action that I am reasonably confident would be taken informally anyway. It would place on the Secretary of State a not especially onerous duty simply to notify the social services department covering the area in which the individual resided when the Secretary of State decided to include that individual on the list—provisionally or otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a minor inconvenience to the Secretary of State. The provision is not prescriptive; it would simply involve conveying information to the social services department, which could then draw its own conclusions about whether any child protection actions within the normal available range were necessary to ensure the protection of other children, within the family or otherwise, who had contact with the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a provision is not included in the Bill, and any informal arrangements break down, so that the Secretary of State reviews a reference and includes an individual on the list who is subsequently found to have abused children within the family, the Secretary of State will be in an embarrassing and awkward position. The public would—rightly—criticise the Committee for its failure to try to ensure that all the children surrounding such an individual were at least reviewed to discover whether any protection actions were required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman's intention is to provide children with a further level of protection beyond that already in the Bill. However, there are areas of concern, one of which—this is a bit technical—relates to privacy. Information is passed by organisations to the Secretary of State confidentially, to be used for a particular purpose. Before it is used for other purposes, thought should be given to whether it is appropriate to do so. I mention that because the Bill obviously must comply with the European convention on human rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it is relevant, but I have trouble believing that the hon. Lady means what she is saying. Are not social services departments the very departments which, as employers, will be applying for information held on the list? We are talking about making information available not to Joe Public or the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i> but to a responsible department, regulated by statute, with important duties defined in statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that was not entirely how the hon. Gentleman presented his case. I was picking up on the manner of disseminating information, which he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8(1) of the ECHR provides a right to respect for privacy and family life. Any interference with that right must be justifiable under article 8(2) as necessary in a democratic society—in this instance, to protect the rights and freedoms of others. Proceeding, as the new clause proposes, with a blanket approach to the circulation of names of individuals either coming on to or leaving the list, would have significant implications under article 8 of the ECHR. Taking into account existing child protection arrangements, I cannot support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two observations to make about the new clause. I have a measure of sympathy with the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge; he and I have already discussed the issue. Essentially, his new clause draws to our attention the effectiveness of existing arrangements to protect children from potential abusers. The hon. Gentleman and the Committee will know that the provisions of section 47 of the Children Act 1989 already place a local authority under a duty to investigate where it has reasonable cause to suspect that a child who lives in or is found in its area is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supporting that provision of the Children Act 1989 is a document entitled "Working Together". I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman or the Committee are familiar with that document, but it gives guidance to agencies about how social services departments and others should exercise their responsibilities. The guidance is issued under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, under which local authorities are required in their social services function to act under the general guidance of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are currently examining the operation of the "Working Together" guidance. Clearly, we do not want there to be problems in protecting children. We do not want the system that we are creating to undermine or in any way compromise the effective work that is done up and down the country to make sure that section 47 of the Children Act 1989 works effectively and that the practical arrangements that are in place in local areas protect children effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and the Committee if I say that the Department of Health is considering a revised draft of the "Working Together" guidance, which is a guide to arrangements for inter-agency co-operation on the protection of children from abuse. Full consultation on a redraft will be undertaken later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made. I assure the Committee that we will seek to ensure that the revised guidance that we issue under statutory authority to social services departments pays particular attention to the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. I understand what he is saying, but this is not simply a question of issuing guidance to social services departments. My concern is about how those departments will get to know about the guidance in the first place. Once they do, the Minister can address guidance to them on what to do. It lies within the Minister's power to ensure that social services departments know about the guidance—he simply needs to say that the Department of Health will inform them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, but if he allows me to develop my argument I will return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the revised "Working Together" guidance properly reflects the Bill's provisions. Our intention is that, in appropriate cases, the procedure that is already in place for notifying the statutory agencies, which include the police, social services and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, should be followed. The area child protection committees might then determine how best to proceed in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has missed the point that I am trying to make. In many cases, the appropriate agencies will already be involved in the referral of the case to the Secretary of State. If so, there will clearly be a requirement for a social services department to exercise its responsibilities while bearing in mind the Children Act 1989, the guidance that we issue under section 7 of the 1970 Act, and the "Working Together" guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the possibility that someone could be included on the list without the social services department that has responsibility being aware of that fact. In practical terms, however, the possibility of that happening is very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me about the new clause—not the spirit behind it, which I perfectly accept—is the mandatory nature of the obligation that it would impose on the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge tried to make a point about proportionality regarding the disclosure of information. She made a good and effective point about the need for us to be aware of our obligations under the European convention on human rights if information is to be disclosed. That is a fair point; we shall be aware of that consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the effective revision of the "Working Together" guidance, the practical situation with which we will be confronted in most cases will ensure that social services departments take appropriate action. We intend to keep the matter under review. We do not want the Bill to create further difficulties or problems. We certainly do not envisage it creating the nightmare scenarios to which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred, although I accept that they would be genuine nightmare scenarios. The Bill is strong enough in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the new clause is drafted would not help to ensure that the Bill complied with the ECHR. It does not discriminate in terms of the information that would be revealed. We need to maintain a sense of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
proportionality and balance as regards the way in which information is shared with various agencies once the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, the new clause is not helpful or useful. We are alert to the point that the hon. Gentleman made, and are trying to deal with it in the guidance that we issue to agencies under the Children Act 1989 and section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. That—not the blanket approach that the hon. Gentleman prefers—is the best way to proceed. We should take a case-by-case approach when considering the effective operation of the child protection procedures that exist throughout the country. We must make sure that those who operate those procedures are fully aware of the implications and consequences of the enactment of the Bill, and aware that the Bill becomes an integral part of the way in which the "Working Together" guidance is applied throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister. I do not think that he has appreciated the situation that often occurs in some of the large conurbations such as greater Manchester, where people may live in Stockport and work in Bolton, or vice versa. Although one thinks of such an area as being one big conurbation, it can be a surprisingly small world. A person living in Stockport may be put on the list by the local authority in Bolton, and nobody in Stockport social services department will know about it. What is the position of the authority in Bolton? It knows exactly why the person was put on the list, or why it was proposed to the Secretary of State that they should be put on the list, and that the person may have a family or be living with somebody in the other authority. Would someone in the authority just get on the telephone and ring up to say, "Hey, do you know what's going on?" and then have a bit of a gossip? Would the Minister not prefer a far more safe statutory arrangement that ensures that if someone has been put on the list for the place where they are employed, at least the authorities in the place where they live will know about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly confused by the arguments that have been made against the amendment. We are being told on the one hand that in the vast majority of cases local social services would already be aware of the situation, and on the other hand that we cannot risk informing them in case we breach the right to privacy that the ECHR conveys. I accept that, as the Minister said, in a large number of cases social services departments will probably already be aware. However, there will be cases in which they are not aware—perhaps cases in which employers have taken swift action and employees have chosen to go quietly without making a fuss. Those are exactly the kinds of cases that the Minister and the hon. Member for Stourbridge were concerned about during earlier debates—case in which, because of a sort of conspiracy between the employer and employee under the old regime, matters may never have come to the attention of the authorities. By placing the list on a statutory basis, the Bill will ensure that even where deals are done for people to go quietly, the information will still be passed to the Secretary of State. I am worried that the process may simply stop there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
I am not an expert on the Police Act 1997. I am therefore not sure whether a social services department, other than when it was considering employing a named individual, would have access to the list held by the criminal records bureau so that it could periodically trawl it to ensure that no one in the area had been placed on the list of whom it was not aware. Unless I am mistaken, there will be no statutory mechanism whereby a social services department can obtain information about people placed on the list, and thus undertake the necessary and proper steps to comply with its statutory duties under the Children Act 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging the spirit in which the amendment was tabled. As he said, I have discussed this matter with him, and I know that he takes it seriously. I am sure that he will address the concerns that have been expressed in the Committee and the deliberations that are going on elsewhere with regard to reformulating the guidance. It will become clear whether there is a problem and, if so, whether the guidance will be sufficient to deal with it. I am glad to have had the opportunity to place the concern on the record. I shall diarise a reminder to myself to check in a couple of years how many social services departments have in practice been unaware of the presence of individuals on the list. If that turns out to be a serious problem, no doubt it can be dealt with by administrative means. That said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Bill does not suffer the same fate on Report as that suffered by the Wild Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill, and that all hon.
