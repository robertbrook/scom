	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It is a great pleasure to serve under you on this Committee, Mr. Cunningham. The Bill has been a while coming and many people deserve credit for its genesis. Now that it is here, we hope to make progress with fulfilling its aim, which is to improve the welfare of dogs kept, and puppies bred, in commercial breeding establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known that some establishments—not all, by any means—fall well short of the standards that should appertain for bitches and puppies. Such cases have come to light all too often when members of the public have had occasion to buy puppies. The Bill is a step towards addressing those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pay tribute to the role of some people in the Bill. First and foremost, I pay tribute to Baroness Wharton for her indefatigable work. I also thank the group of 11 organisations representing animal welfare, dog breeders, local authorities, the veterinary profession and the pet care industry that have worked together to prepare the Bill. They are the Blue Cross, the British Dog Breeders Council, the British Veterinary Association, the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, Justice for Dogs, the Kennel Club, the National Canine Defence League, the National Dog Wardens Association, the Pet Care Trust, ProDogs, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. I mention especially the work of Barry Huckle of the Pet Care Trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the work of the all-party group on animal welfare. I am grateful to the Minister for the personal interest that he has taken in the Bill, for the support of members of his office, and for the Government's support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Maxton, I—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry, Mr. Cunningham. I have had 24 hours of addressing Mr. Maxton, so I hope that you will forgive one slip. I commend the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INSPECTION AND REPORT BEFORE GRANT OF LICENCE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 6, leave out from 'In' to end of line 2 on
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
page 2 and insert 'the Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 ("the 1973 Act"), after subsection (2 of section 1 insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) On receipt of an application by a person to a local authority for the grant of a licence under this Act in respect of any premises—
	<ol>
	<li>if a licence under this Act has not previously been granted to the person in respect of the premises, the authority shall arrange for the inspection of the premises by a veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner and by an officer of the authority; and</li>
	<li>in any other case, the authority may arrange for the inspection of the premises by a veterinary surgeon or veterinary practitioner or by an officer of the authority (or by both).</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2B) Where an inspection is arranged under subsection (2A) of this section, the local authority shall arrange for the making of a report about the premises, the applicant and any other relevant matter; and the authority shall consider the report before determining whether to grant a licence.".'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 10, in clause 6, page 5, line 19, leave out 'and (2B)'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are largely technical amendments to give effect to the original intention of the working group. They provide that before a licence is granted, breeding establishment premises must be inspected by a veterinary surgeon or practitioner and a local authority officer. For subsequent inspections, the local authority is given the flexibility to send a vet, an officer or both. That will often save costs, but it will not weaken inspection. The Bill will improve existing inspection arrangements and, therefore, the welfare of dogs and pups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and the Bill and I congratulate the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) on his good fortune in drawing a place in the ballot. I associate myself with his praise of a number of people and organisations. Modesty forbids me from joining in with the compliments that the paid to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) introduced such a Bill some 12 months ago. Unfortunately, it failed to complete its parliamentary procedure and make the statute book. I know that he has been supportive to the hon. Member for Hertsmere in moving the issue forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should pay a compliment to you, Mr. Cunningham. I know form previous experience that your Scottish sense of fair play, coupled with your midlands sense of getting the business done efficiently, will stand us in good stead. It would not be wise to detain the Committee unnecessarily, so I will not. I am reminded by two members of the Committee of a related issue and with a bit of latitude on your part, Mr. Cunningham, perhaps I could tell the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South (Ms Southworth) has a good young offenders institution in her constituency called Thorn Cross, which I visited before the general election. It was an interesting visit. The governor asked me why the then Member for Don Valley, Martin Redmond, who, as many members of the Committee will recall, was a prolific tabler of written questions, took such a strong interest in the prison. I said that I was not aware that he had and asked in what sense he had taken an interest. It transpired that he had tabled a series of written questions about a donkey that had managed to escape from Thorn Cross, how long it was at large, where it had got to, how it was recaptured and any other aspect that he could imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governor's concern was that he and his staff had spent so long providing information to answer the written questions that the management of the establishment had suffered. I tell that story only because there is clearly a connection between Don Valley and animal welfare that continues to this day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the Bill has already been given by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, but it would be remiss of me not to mention that the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) has played a prominent role over several years on the issue. I know that he will be pleased that the Bill is moving forward. It certainly reflects the concerns that the parliamentary group that he formerly chaired has voiced over several years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has the support of numerous organisations, many of which the hon. Member for Hertsmere has acknowledged. I join him in paying tribute to the work that Baroness Wharton has carried out with the various interested parties in developing the Bill, which is certainly better for having gone through that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to address three concerns. The first, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, is the welfare of bitches and puppies and the conditions in which they are kept. The second is the increased likelihood of unhealthy puppies being sold to the public. The third is the practice of some unscrupulous dog breeders who taint the legitimate business interests of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will have gathered from my remarks that the Government are sympathetic both to this largely technical amendment and to the Bill. I know that our deliberations will be careful. All the amendments that have been tabled are sensible and I shall not detain the Committee by opposing any of them. I wish the Bill speedy progress. Let us all hope that it will end up on the statute book this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Caroline Flint 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Don Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment on what my hon. Friend the Minister said. A year or so ago, I discovered that my local authority had once attended a conference on stray horses in Ireland. There may be a Don Valley parliamentary or local government connection with such matters. I declare an interest as a patron of the RSPCA South Yorkshire animal centre. I was pleased to support my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale in his attempt last year to get such a Bill on to the statute book. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hertsmere on taking up the challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reputable dog breeders who have welfare as their first concern. However, some people see dog breeding as an easy way to make a quick buck and have no consideration for the dogs or for families who purchase them in good faith. As a child, I experienced the problem of getting a pet that turned out to be ill and had to be put to sleep. There is nothing more distressing than seeing children's great expectations of giving love and care to an animal being cruelly betrayed when an animal is not fit to become a pet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill addresses an important matter. We must ensure that the welfare of the animals is uppermost in the minds of those who breed them and that we have the necessary regulation and authority to enforce that. Most pet owners take pet ownership seriously. We are known as a dog-loving nation and it is terrible to think that despite that reputation, there are countless examples of abuse of pet dogs. Abuse can start with the birth of the dogs and the manner in which they are passed on to owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill. I received countless letters from constituents when the issue last came before the House. I have continued to keep them informed of progress. I hope that the Bill will be successful and that this Parliament can start to put right the bad practice that remains a sad feature of the breeding and selling of dogs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere on taking the Bill through so expeditiously. I thank him and the Minister for their unfailing courtesy during our entirely non-partisan deliberations. I also appreciate the work of the chairman of the all-party animal welfare group, or whatever it is now called. I agree about the great work of Baroness Wharton, without whom the Bill would not be before us. I hope that it goes through the remainder of its proceedings unfettered and undamaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham. I do not want to detain the Committee long. I was a member of the Committee that considered the Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Weaver Vale. It is important to highlight the effects of the Bill, especially this week when
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the RSPCA has published a report about increased negligence of and cruelty to animals. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. It will go a long way to putting right some of the wrongs that occur in this country, which is supposed to be a nation of animal lovers.

The dog warden in Bradford has done tremendous work over the years on issues such as voluntary registration schemes. I put on record my thanks and those of the population of Bradford to Mr. Singh for his work in promoting the welfare of animals, especially of dogs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that hon. Members have put a lot of effort into the Bill, but let us keep this short and sweet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Helen Southworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend, as I might well call him on this occasion, the Member for Hertsmere has brought the Bill to the House again. He was with me at the opening of Crafts this year, and he met my dog Findbharr. He was well aware, as my hon. Friend the Minister was when he came to my constituency and met my dog, that people prefer dogs to politicians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very wisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Southworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Often very wisely because the one thing about my dog is that you can always trust him. Hon. Members have made tremendous efforts to support the welfare of animals because we recognise that companion animals are important to people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with the sale of dogs. The relationship between breeders, sellers and purchasers is important enabling people to choose the right dog for their lifestyle and the right temperament for their family. The development of that relationship is important. In my constituency, a number of pet shops have already been working in advance of the Bill to set that up. I am sure that we shall see far better provision for ensuring that people purchase the right dog.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady told me earlier that somehow she intended to get the name of her dog in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I see no problem with what she said, but she did work a flanker on me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basildon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a pet owner, but I want to stress one aspect of the Bill. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) brought home to people the real suffering of animals. I pay tribute to all the hon. Members who have been mentioned, especially the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who has done a great job in steering the Bill through the Committee with the assistance of other hon. Members and to hon. Members who previously introduced similar Bills, I pay tribute to Baroness Wharton, to whom many in the parliamentary group for animal welfare owe a great debt for keeping the issue on the political agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter from a distressed constituent last week that brings home to us why the Bill is so necessary. She bought a dog in good faith from someone whom she thought was a reputable breeder. A couple of years on,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
not only has she had to pay a fortune in vet's fees, but the dog has suffered as a result of inappropriate breeding. She has tried to get justice through the courts. She reported to me that the dog's mother was an elderly bitch who had had numerous litters. Her dog has congenital defects and is unhealthy. I hope that the Bill will prevent the sort of suffering caused to her, her pet and her family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all reminded of past RSPCA campaigns. We have seen pictures of hugh piles of dead dogs that had to be destroyed because they were unwanted and uncared for as a result of unscrupulous breeding. Those of us who have dog wardens in our constituency will know that before dog wardens were introduced, packs of dogs roamed about frightening local residents. Dog wardens have got rid of that problem. The campaign to make every animal a wanted animal is important. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Hertsmere because the Bill goes a long way to making that a reality. Without it, we would see far greater suffering of domestic pets. I am grateful to him for introducing it and I am sure that it will have the full support of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Amess 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southend, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving later, Mr. Cunningham. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere on his efforts and thank the Minister for supporting him. I understand that the Bill was dealt with in 10 minutes. Unlike the hon. Member for Warrington, South, I did not have the honour to open Crufts, but I presented one of the main prizes in the new utility group. My hon. Friend's Bill does great credit to him, to all those organisations that have been mentioned, to Baroness Wharton and to the Kennel Club. I hope that its remaining stages will be dealt with as swiftly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Cawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Goole)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that hon. Members are speaking to the Bill, even if only at the end of our proceedings. For one glorious moment, I thought that we had gone back 20 years in the Labour party's history and that I was back in some committee room agreeing to everything without debate and then realising afterwards what we had agreed to. I am sure that on this occasion there was genuine consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am chair of the associate parliamentary group for animal welfare as it is now called, for reasons with which I will not bore hon. Members today. We had a meeting when the hon. Member for Hertsmere introduced the Bill. He gave an excellent presentation that members of the group supported thoroughly. Even at that early stage we knew that this was a Bill that we wanted to succeed and, perhaps more important, that it had warm support from all political parties in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members have mentioned Baroness Wharton. She is an able vice-chairman of the parliamentary group who does her best to persuade me that perhaps that there is something in hereditary peerage
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
after all. She has not quite succeeded yet. Without the effort that she put into the Bill, we would not be here today. Other hon. Members have mentioned it and we are very grateful for all that she did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been encouraged by the Committee stage because clearly everyone agrees with the Bill and some good technical amendments have been approved. I wish it well and I hope that we can all persuade our colleagues across the House that it very much needs to be on the statute book. I hope that it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Allan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the Bill and I congratulate the hon. Member for Hertsmere. It could be said that by being here I am showing that I am a glutton for punishment, as he and I began a sitting of another Standing Committee at 4.30 pm yesterday which is still sitting some way down the Corridor. We have spent many hours listening to each other expound on a quite different Bill. Perhaps we may learn some lessons about Government assistance in expediting business to take back down the Corridor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My interest in the Bill comes from a general interest in animal welfare and dog rescue organisations. Sheffield dog rescue came to me because it often has to pick up the pieces when an unlicensed breeding establishment has gone wrong. It ends up looking after animals that it has taken out of appalling circumstances. It has presented dreadful cases to me and says that there is nothing that it can do under current legislation. It has been incredibly frustrated so I am sure that, like me and all other members of the Committee, it will be welcome the opportunity to introduce legislation that we can test. It will enable organisations to go out there with some teeth and try to deal with appalling instances such as those that happen in my city and, I am sure, everywhere else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to colleagues for their comments. I should mention that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) is a sponsor of the Bill on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. I am grateful to all hon. Members who have attended today and supported the Bill, and to those hon. Members who are sponsors of it. I hope that it can make similar progress in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the outset that you would dispatch our business with efficiency and fairness, Mr. Cunningham. Our conduct under your wise chairmanship has borne out that prediction. I join other hon. Members in wishing the Bill speedy progress. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South, I do not have a dog to mention, but my daughter owns a rabbit called Thumper. I thought that it would go down well with her if I got a mention of that in 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of the Committee, I note that I have two dogs, but I am not going to get their names in 	<i>Hansard</i> as some hon. Members have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
