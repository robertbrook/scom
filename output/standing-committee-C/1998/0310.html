<div class='page-header'><h1>Protection of Children Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Debra Shipley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stourbridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have had the honour of serving in Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Wells, and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so. I am also grateful for the opportunity to pilot the Protection of Children Bill through the House.<br><br>
This Bill has an important aim: to prevent children being harmed. That intention was recognised on Second Reading, when the measure received serious attention from Members of all parties, who raised valuable points for the Committee's consideration.<br><br>
I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Protection of Children Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am delighted to have the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Wells. I hope that I shall be part of an operation that will ensure that a well-intentioned Bill is honed into a measure that will receive a Third Reading on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley) mentioned, the Bill gained all-party support on its Second Reading. However, serious concerns were raised about certain details, especially in relation to implementing those principles that enjoyed that broad support. My approach—like that of all hon. Members who spoke—was to address those concerns constructively, in the hope of improving the Bill in Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge would acknowledge that the Bill has substantive and technical defects in its current form. I have not served on a Committee considering a private Member's Bill before, so I was not sure whether the Government would table amendments or steer the hon. Member for Stourbridge towards tabling amendments that would clean the measure up. I fear that some important issues have not been addressed by the amendments that have been tabled.<br><br>
I am a little disappointed that the hon. Member for Stourbridge has not tabled more amendments. On Second Reading, she appeared to note hon. Members' concerns and accept points that were made in a constructive and generous spirit. I hoped that that regard would turn into amendments that would make the Bill acceptable to all reasonable Members of Parliament.<br><br>
The Committee should be grateful to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who has tabled many amendments that encapsulate points that he and other hon. Members made on Second Reading. I hope that the gratitude that I am expressing is appropriate, as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
amendments have been tabled in a constructive spirit and are not merely tactical, as was the case with a recent infamous, and ultimately ill-fated, private Member's Bill.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) for his thoughtful and carefully considered amendments. I hope that the Committee will proceed in the spirit that was apparent on Second Reading. We agree about the principles of the Bill, but it should be tightened. We should acknowledge that, while the measure cannot be a comprehensive solution to such a large problem, none the less it can contribute to improving the current position. It would be folly to try to make the measure a comprehensive solution. Above all, the Bill must be approached in a spirit of compromise and with a desire to tackle all the legitimate objections that were raised on Second Reading. I hope that we shall make rapid and constructive progress.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Protection of Children Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution connected to the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. As a general rule, adequate notice of amendments should be given. I shall not call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.</span></p>

Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DUTY OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO KEEP LIST</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 13, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>', or should no longer be included in it.'.</p></blockquote>
I refrained from speaking on Second Reading to ensure that we finished in time and to enable others to express their views. I am keen for the Bill to be enacted, but I want to ensure that we protect not only children but the civil rights of those whose name may be put on the list. I shall try to be as brief as possible when moving amendments.<br><br>
I do not like categorising people, but it is possible to divide those whose name may appear on the list into two categories. The first group might be described as people who are predatory or who prey on young people. I do not believe that the behaviour of most people in that category will change in their lifetime. Therefore, one could present a reasonable argument for keeping their name on the list. However, there is another group of people whose behaviour on one or more occasions is totally inappropriate, and possibly criminal, but whose likelihood of putting children at risk again will disappear as their life goes on. Therefore, the Secretary of State should have the power to remove from the list the names of people who have been wrongly included in it and of those who no longer pose a danger or threat.<br><br>
Including such a provision in the Bill is simple, but the process of removing a name from the list may be more complicated. Nevertheless, we should provide for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Secretary of State to remove from the list the names of people who have been included wrongly, perhaps as a result of a false accusation, and of those who are unlikely to cause problems in later life.<br><br>
On occasions, people are deprived of opportunities to work in a specific job because of some misdemeanour that occurred a long time ago, yet all the evidence shows that the misdemeanour is not likely to recur. That is sad. I plead with my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge to accept the amendment because it would improve the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I paid close attention to my hon. Friend's carefully reasoned argument, but I cannot accept the amendment. The Bill is designed to protect children from harm. My hon. Friend spoke about someone who, later in life, is not likely to cause harm—I paraphrase his remarks. Children should not be placed at risk in any circumstances; for that reason, I do not accept that someone who seriously harmed a child should, even much later in life, be allowed to work with children.<br><br>
The Bill contains many mechanisms, the most crucial being an independent tribunal, which means that no one's name will appear on the list unless they have seriously offended. I reject the amendment for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not planning to speak to the amendment because I presumed that it would be accepted without argument. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish is necessary; it would give the Secretary of State a reserve power to act when it was manifestly unreasonable to leave someone's name on the list because of the stigma attached. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State could remove a name only if it became clear that it should not have been there in the first place. It may have been right to put a person's name on the list in the first place, yet with the benefit of 20 or 30 years' effluxion of time it may become clear that it is no longer appropriate for that person's name to be on the list.<br><br>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Stourbridge about the alternative safeguards. Yes, there is a tribunal, but it will act when a person's name is put on the list, because that person will have the right to apply to the tribunal. However, in the Bill as drafted, the tribunal would not have a role 20 years down the line in reviewing whether it was still appropriate for that person's name to be on the list. The Secretary of State would not have the power to remove the name of such a person—perhaps someone who had become seriously ill or disabled—from the list. There are various scenarios in which a person could no longer be said to be a hazard to children. There may not be many such cases, but the Secretary of State should have the reserve power to step in when it is obvious that an injustice is being perpetrated.<br><br>
As I said on Second Reading, if the Bill does not operate fairly and deliver natural justice across the board it will not be credible or durable. I urge members of the Committee to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to the points made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, who said that there are two categories of people who may end up on the list: paedophiles and people who deliberately abuse children, for whom we know that there is no cure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
or hope of anything happening to change that predilection, and people who are guilty of some incompetence or misjudgment. We might imagine someone early in a career making a mistake that, while not serious enough to put a child in grave danger, was of a level of incompetence that could mean inclusion on the list under the Bill. With maturity and growing experience, such a person would not be a risk of any kind to children.<br><br>
I am sure that many members of the Committee are parents. There will have been occasions for all of us when we were fortunate that something that we did with a child did not result in his or her falling downstairs or being run over by a bus. We will have learnt from such a mistake to be more careful next time, or to take hold of a hand. To put someone's name on the list for a lifetime, for minor incompetence rather than serious neglect or intentional abuse, will not only attach a lifelong stigma to that person but bar him or her for life from working or volunteering in a child care organisation.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
It would be natural justice to give the Secretary of State discretion to remove from the list, at a later date, a person such as I have described, should an application be made, and provided the Secretary of State was satisfied that the applicant passed the test of no longer being a danger to children. I am very disappointed that the hon. Member for Stourbridge feels unable to accept the amendment. I hope that she and her hon. Friends may reconsider their view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak. I confess that I am in two minds and would like to explore one or two thoughts. Perhaps the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will be able to help me out, with respect to his own thinking about the amendment.<br><br>
My presumption, on first reading the amendment, was against it. It seemed that the purpose of the Bill, as I noted on Second Reading, was to provide—as far as is possible—absolute levels of protection for children. Of course that is not achievable, but the object is to go as far as possible towards it. In that sense, any balancing that is done is between the privilege of being able to work with children and their right to be looked after in a harm-free environment. From that viewpoint, even though a person whose name had been put on the list believed, years later, that he or she would no longer represent a threat to children, society's obligation might be to take the view that the fact that they had once harmed a child or brought about circumstances that could have done so warranted permanent inclusion in the list.<br><br>
Without wanting to anticipate future debates of this Committee—you would rule me out of order if I did, Mr. Wells—it strikes me that we have yet to discuss the circumstances under which a person's name would be included in the list. That presents a difficulty. Perhaps it will be decided that inclusion in the list will arise from gross misconduct, misconduct or what I should term gross incompetence—or possibly we should leave out the question of incompetence, in accordance with amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. If those harsher grounds were the basis for inclusion, it would be reasonable to decide that people should remain on the list.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
However, the hon. Member for Taunton raised the possibility that incompetence causing harm or risk of harm might be a reason for inclusion in the list. That is not exactly the same as the test of serious harm that the hon. Member for Stourbridge described. We could probably all conceive of circumstances in which a person who had been incompetent in that way could later be demonstrably no more likely than anyone else to cause harm to children—or, adopting a commonsense approach, might even be less likely to cause harm to children. We all know that the one mistake or incompetent act that we do not commit is the one that we committed in the past. Under those circumstances, the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish makes a good point.<br><br>
I intend to narrow the text slightly at later stages of the Bill so that we are talking, for example, about "gross incompetence" that risks harming children. I should tell the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish that, at this stage, I shall not support his amendment. However, if amendments narrowing the inclusion on the list are not passed, we should consider returning to the issue on Report and offer a mechanism similar to the hon. Gentleman's, which would allow the Secretary of State to receive an application for a name to be removed from the list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Syms <span class='memberconstituency'>(Poole)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a good deal of sympathy for the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. If I were the Secretary of State, I would not want to have to choose whose name should be on the list. Clause 3 already provides a sort of right of appeal to the Secretary of State for those whose name may have been accidentally placed on the list or those who do not deserve to be on it. That would be broadened only slightly if we allowed an appeal to those who should no longer be included on the list.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Taunton argued that someone in charge of children who was incompetent at an early stage of a career might have an unblemished record for the next 20 years. In those circumstances, such a person may not deserve to have a lifelong sentence with respect to the list. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire was right in saying that we must examine the criteria for inclusion. At the moment, they are relatively broad and might include incompetents as well as sex offenders.<br><br>
One relevant point that emerged on Second Reading was the problem of deciding what should happen to people who have been prosecuted for, but acquitted of, a sex offence. Will they be added to the list after acquittal by the court? Is it only those who have been acquitted who will not be added to the list? Will the names of those who have not been to court but against whom serious evidence exists be added to the list?<br><br>
I may be broadening the debate slightly from the terms of the clause, but it is important to ask about the criteria for inclusion on the list. That is an administrative process rather than a legal process, but it will impinge on the legal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
process. We must decide what to do when people have been taken to court, prosecuted and cleared by a jury. Are they to be added to the list automatically as potential suspects? Will some people who commit sex offences against children be found to have been cleared by the courts?<br><br>
There is also the danger of catching all sorts of people whose fault is not to have been very competent when in charge of scouts. Yet the burden of proof in a court case may prevent others who are serious offenders against children from being convicted. We shall have to address those problems as the Committee progresses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed by the reply by my hon. Friend the Member of Stourbridge and I hope that she will give the amendment further thought. I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time with hypothetical examples or those drawn from my experience. I must tell my hon. Friend, however, that in drafting a Bill to protect children, it is important not to end up harming children.<br><br>
I would like to give one example from my experience as a member of Oldham borough council a long time ago. A well run children's home worked on the principle that the house mother was employed by the local authority and her husband received accommodation and food from the council.<br><br>
The husband died and about four years later, the house mother informed the committee that she intended to re-marry—to someone who regularly delivered goods to the children's home. In order for her to remain the house mother, the local authority had to vet her husband to find out whether he was a suitable person to become a house father and to be, in a sense, employed by the authority—although he received emoluments instead of a wage.<br><br>
The committee discovered that the man had had a criminal conviction for an offence against a young girl, when he was about 18 years old. I do not approve of that; the girl was 15 years old at the time, and it should not have happened. As things stand at present, that man's name would not be on the list. However, if he had been a council employee at the time, his name could easily have been put on the list as a result of that conviction. Some 30 years after the conviction, was he a suitable person for the local authority to allow to move into the children's home? If he did not move in, the house mother, who had looked after those children for a substantial period, would almost certainly have had to move out.<br><br>
The committee had a difficult decision to take. It eventually agreed that the conviction had taken place so long ago that the man was unlikely to harm the children in the home. As far as I know, no difficulties arose from that decision during the remainder of my time on Oldham borough council. However, if the name of someone like that had been put on the list 20 or 30 years earlier, it would now be impossible to remove it, because the conviction is not in dispute, and there is no means of removing a name simply because the passage of time and the present circumstances might suggest that it was reasonable to do so.<br><br>

I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge is keen to protect children. However, when faced with the dilemma of whether to disrupt the house in which they live and treat as their home, the house mother whom they understand—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-Under-Lyme)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One can never know. That is what the Bill is about. If that man were put in a position where he had the opportunity to commit a crime again—and it would be a crime, in my opinion—he might take it. One can never know, and one should not take the risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that one can take risks. No behaviour that that man would be likely to engage in could be as much of a crime against those children as explaining to them that the house mother, whom they regard as a parent, would have to either not marry or move out of the home and cease to be a parent to them. There should, therefore, be a mechanism whereby someone can be taken off the list in exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that we may be able to approach the matter differently later, when we examine the question of incompetence. However, it would be far better to introduce a safeguard. I am willing to accept that, because our priority is the safety of children, such a safeguard should be a very rarely used power, but future Secretaries of State will be in a difficult position if they do not have the discretion to remove from the list the names of people whose circumstances have dramatically changed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to some of the points raised.<br><br>
I would like to emphasise that there is currently no right of appeal or independent tribunal for those on the consultancy index. Such people may not know that their name appears on the index. The Bill provides a voice for the first time for those who might have had their name included on the index incorrectly. It is an important check and balance to the initiatives that I am proposing to protect children. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire for reminding the Committee, as he reminded hon. Members on Second Reading, that working with children is a privilege not a right. We should always bear that in mind. I should tell the hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire and for Poole (Mr. Syms) and my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish that the criteria for inclusion will be raised at a later stage, when I will have a number of things to say.</span></p>

INCLUSION IN LIST ON REFERENCE TO SECRETARY OF STATE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 1, line 18, after 'has', insert 'lawfully'.<br><br>
A large number of amendments have been tabled to the clause because it is the crux of our debate on the balancing of civil liberties. In our earlier debate, we drew attention to the fact that the crucial issue for many of us is the level at which people are put on the list. As it stands, the clause does not impose a requirement for a dismissal to have been lawful before someone's name is put on the list.<br><br>
I know that we shall come to this debate later, but there is no criterion for the seriousness of the level of misconduct or incompetence that needs to have been exhibited before someone's name is put on the list. Indeed, the name of a person whose dismissal had been found by a tribunal to be unlawful could still be included on the list. If a tribunal found that he had not been dismissed for valid reasons, it would be unfair for him still to be barred from working in child care for the rest of his life. The amendment is simple. Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing before there is a restriction on his or her right to work. Any dismissal should have been lawful in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with what the hon. Member for Taunton is seeking to achieve. However, I fear that this is not the place to make this change, and that it would not achieve her objective. Clause 2(2) talks about the conditions that must be fulfilled for an organisation to report someone to the Secretary of State. If an organisation has dismissed an individual, except in rare circumstances of malicious behaviour it must be presumed to believe that it has dismissed him lawfully. It would therefore report the dismissal to the Secretary of State. I suspect that inserting the term "lawful" at this point, as the hon. Member for Taunton proposes, would not have an impact on the behaviour of reporting organisations but might leave them vulnerable to legal action at a later stage by the person being reported if the dismissal was subsequently overturned by a tribunal. That would be onerous, particularly for smaller or voluntary organisations.<br><br>
We shall have to return to the matter, but I think that what the hon. Member for Taunton is seeking would be more effectively achieved if the reference to lawfulness were inserted in clause 2(6), thereby making the test that the Secretary of State, before putting someone on the list, must determine that dismissal had been lawful. He might then wait for any appeal tribunal process to run its course before making his decision. The distinction is therefore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
whether the Secretary of State has to believe, on the balance of evidence, that dismissal was lawful before putting a person on the list, or whether—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument seems plausible, so why did he not table an amendment to that effect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not necessarily consider it my role to police hon. Members' amendments. I read the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Taunton in detail only last night, and only in the past few minutes, after reading the Bill once more, have I realised that there is a better place to deal with the issues that she raises. I speak in a constructive spirit when I say that unless the hon. Lady is suggesting that organisations are dismissing individuals, believing that doing so is unlawful, I do not think that her proposal would have any practical effect. In my view, we should return later and achieve what she rightly seeks by changing clause 2(6).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's view to the extent that I think that the question whether dismissal is lawful or otherwise should not govern whether an organisation reports a person to the list because, as my hon. Friend explained clearly, presumably the organisation, except in the case of malice, would act on the basis of its expectation of its own decisions falling within the law. That is not the point.<br><br>
However, I do not concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) that we therefore need—this answers the point made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish—to seek later an amendment that serves his purpose. As far as I can see, the test applied by the Secretary of State for references made to him is not a test of whether a dismissal was lawful, but relates to the circumstances of the reference and the information supplied with it, and to whether, on that basis, the Secretary of State believes a person to be guilty of misconduct or, as it may prove to be, incompetence leading to harm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with my hon. Friend's point. I merely attempted to suggest mechanistically that what the hon. Member for Taunton had in mind could be better achieved elsewhere in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But my hon. Friend will probably accept that he must not try to be too helpful or the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will chastise him for not tabling helpful amendments.<br><br>
My initial conclusion is that the Secretary of State will not make a test of whether a dismissal was lawful; a test will be made on the basis of the evidence offered. If the circumstances of dismissal were germane to the issue of whether it was lawful, the evidence could be provided to the Secretary of State by the person in question. If the Secretary of State included a person's name on the list, and evidence was brought to bear during an employment tribunal that the dismissal was not lawful because, for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
example, errors of fact had been made by the employer, and the dismissal was overturned, there is no reason why that person should not make the same case to the tribunal proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
If the errors vitiated the argument that somebody was guilty of misconduct, it would be reasonable for the tribunal to reach that judgment. Under the Bill, the tribunal would not be conducting a test of whether somebody had been dismissed from a position lawfully, but rather, having considered all the circumstances of the proposed case, whether the person had been guilty of misconduct or incompetence leading to harm to children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has shown that there is a misconception on the part of the hon. Member for Taunton about the roles of the employment tribunal and the Secretary of State and the criteria that are used. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Minister is present. It would be useful for him to put on the record his position on such a point. There is always a difficulty about how courts interpret legislation. On the whole, the words in an Act have to be examined. However, there is a legal ruling that I can never remember, whereby gradually the Law Lords have accepted that on occasions the intentions of the Minister during discussion of proposed legislation may be considered. I am worried about that, because although I understand that the Law Lords can examine the intentions of a Minister, I am not certain whether, in the case of a private Member's Bill, the intentions of the promoter may be examined. Will the Minister tell the Committee what the Government think about some of the important issues?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was intending to say a few words about the amendments at the end of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not seem to be rushing to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting for the debate to come to an end before I indicated to the Chairman that I wanted to say a few words. The reason why I wanted to leave my contribution until the end is that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge made the position clear when she briefly made her response to the amendment.<br><br>
There has been confusion during the debate about the role of an employment tribunal and the responsibilities of the Secretary of State as set out in the Bill for deciding whether a person's name should be included on the list that he would maintain.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said in his helpful contribution, it is conceivable—I would not say it more strongly—that an employment tribunal might conclude in an individual case that the reason for a dismissal was fair because misconduct might have placed a child at risk of harm but that the dismissal itself has been unfair, and therefore unlawful, because the employer's own disciplinary procedures had been breached.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Taunton could mean that the Secretary of State would have no powers to put a person on the list because, although the tribunal had concluded that there were reasons, such as misconduct, to justify dismissal, for other reasons the dismissal was found to be unfair. Someone could have committed an act of misconduct and placed a child at risk of harm, but the Secretary of State could not place that person on the list because the industrial tribunal had decided, for procedural reasons, that the dismissal was unfair.<br><br>
The criteria according to which the Secretary of State will operate his powers are set out clearly in clause 2(6). They are different from the test adopted by an employment tribunal. If he is satisfied that the referring organisation reasonably considered, on the balance of probabilities, that the individual was guilty of the alleged misconduct—that is the test applied by the tribunal—the criteria in clause 2(6)(a) will be met. He must then consider the individual's suitability to work with children.<br><br>
There are different sets of criteria, and two different roles will be discharged. The employment tribunal will consider all the circumstances of the case, including compliance with disciplinary procedure. The failure to comply with such a procedure could make a dismissal unfair, even though a tribunal had established the reason that justified dismissal.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
For those reasons, I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge and consider the amendment unnecessary and unhelpful. It would make it possible for the name of someone who had placed a child at the risk of harm not to be included in the list because of a technical breach in the dismissal procedure.<br><br>
I have trepidation about intervening, given the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish about the possibility of the Law Lords interpreting my remarks when considering litigation. I am not sure of the position concerning private Members' Bills. I have tried to set out the Government's view on the amendment, and I hope that that will clarify the matter in the Committee at least. I am not sure about the implication of my comments on any possible litigation procedure. I know that Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart was an important decision that guides ministerial comments during the passage of Government legislation.<br><br>
I have stated the Government's views on the merits of the amendment. I hope that hon. Members will be reassured by our view that it is unhelpful and unnecessary. I trust that the hon. Member for Taunton will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister: his intervention was helpful and it amplified points made by the hon. Member for Stourbridge.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said that an organisation that dismissed someone would assume that that action was lawful. If that were true, we would not need employment tribunals, people are often dismissed because that is convenient for the employer, or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
out of malice. Dismissals are not always lawful; that is why employment tribunals often find in favour of employees.<br><br>
I accept the Minister's argument that a dismissal might be found unlawful for purely technical reasons and that, therefore, the amendment might not be helpful and might achieve the opposite of my intentions. There might be a more sensible time to raise the matter, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 1, line 19, leave out 'misconduct' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'sexual or other intentional abuse'.</p></blockquote>
We are now getting to the heart of the issue. I do not know whether there is a legal definition of misconduct—perhaps someone will tell us during the debate. Could a lapse of attention that led to a child not being harmed but being put at risk of harm be considered as misconduct? If that were the case, I suspect that all of us, in our working and private lives, have been guilty of such a lapse of attention.<br><br>
Could breaking the rules be construed as misconduct, even if the rules were not sensible? Could colluding with or turning a blind eye to children in a residential establishment who were having a midnight feast be understood as misconduct? What about teachers who reveal their political views? Is that misconduct?<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Stourbridge said on Second Reading and in Committee, the Bill will try to unearth people who deliberately harm children through sexual abuse or other abuse or neglect. The amendment would spell that out on the face of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Taunton and I are going to switch roles occasionally during the Committee. I think that the definition in her amendment is too restrictive, although I have some sympathy for what she says and understand why she is proposing it. However, it seems that there are examples of "misconduct" for which someone should be placed on the list that are not.
<br><blockquote><p>"sexual or other intentional abuse".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Taunton gave the example of someone acquiescing in a midnight feast in a children's home, but what about someone acquiescing in the taking of prohibited drugs in a children's home? That seems to me to be the kind of "misconduct" that must remain in the scope of the clause, and it is not clear that that would be covered by the term
<br><blockquote><p>"sexual or other intentional abuse".</p></blockquote>
We will consider amendments that introduce the concept of seriousness into the definition of "harm". I remind the hon. Member for Taunton that the test is not only that the person involved has been dismissed for misconduct, but that such misconduct has led to harm or put children "at risk of harm". One of those amendments will seek to strengthen that test by rewriting the clause to read.
<br><blockquote><p>"at risk of serious harm".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
I have considerable reservations about the breadth of the subsection as it stands, but I cannot believe that the hon. Lady's amendment will be helpful, as it would narrow the definition of the type of misconduct covered. I urge her to withdraw the amendment and rely instead on the amendments that are to be considered later that will introduce the seriousness test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill's scope is not intended to be limited to sexual abuse. As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has pointed out, it needs to have a much wider scope than that. It is important to bear in mind that our definition of "harm" is based on that in the Children Act 1989, in which
<br><blockquote><p>"'harm' means ill-treatment or the impairment of health or development;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'development' means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'health' means physical or mental health; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'ill-treatment' includes sexual abuse and forms of ill-treatment which are not physical."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Syms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to explore what my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said. If someone in charge of a children's home was aware that children were taking a prohibited drug and was trying to stop them, would he or she still be held responsible for those actions and so be added to the list?<br><br>
Let us imagine that a child of either sex from a local authority's children's home was engaging in prostitution, as, I am sad to say, occasionally happens. There is a difference between an individual who abuses another individual, and an individual who knows what someone in his or her care is doing and is trying to stop them. If a young girl is picked up off the street for prostitution, might the head of the home—who might have been aware and have warned the child—end up on the list and therefore lose his or her livelihood? That would seem to be against natural justice.<br><br>
How do we juggle such issues? There is a difference between someone sleeping with a girl at a home, and someone trying to control a child—who may have had a difficult childhood—who is known to disappear on occasions. It is an important question of balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to respond to all the amendments, as I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge can competently respond to most of them. However, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has raised a reasonable question, and, at this point, I shall try to reassure him about the Bill and how we envisage it working. He must be clear about the structure of the Bill and the circumstances than can lead to the inclusion of a person's name on the list. The employer has to be satisfied that a person has committed an act of misconduct or incompetence. The Secretary of State then has to be satisfied that, because of that misconduct or incompetence, the person is unsuitable to work with children.<br><br>
We can all exercise common sense—certainly in the example cited by the hon. Member for Poole. If a person has taken practical steps to prevent a child from being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
exposed to harm, no reasonable employer is likely to conclude that such action constitutes misconduct. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee will appreciate that we cannot determine, given the wide variety of circumstances that cannot be predicted, when a person will be included on the list. The Bill lays out a clear structure about a person's misconduct and incompetence that places a child at risk, and the Secretary of State must be satisfied that that conduct renders that person unsuitable to work with children.<br><br>
The Bill's structure is robust. It is designed to prevent people who are suitable to work with children from ending up on the list. If people are suitable to work with children the Bill will not pose any risk to their future employment in a job that brings them into contact with children. It will ensure that such a person as described in the example cited by the hon. Member for Poole does not end up on the list if he has acted reasonably and has taken steps to ensure that children under his care are not exposed to harm. The Secretary of State must be satisfied in each case that the person who committed misconduct or incompetence is unsuitable to work with children. Such a robust structure will withstand the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Poole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by what the Minister said. I understand that the Secretary of State or the tribunal has control over the final list, but what about the preliminary list and the length of time that someone can be on it? The preliminary list is activated merely by an organisation putting forward a name. The Minister's reassurance applies only to the permanent list, not the temporary list. However, someone may stay on the temporary list for a substantial period and that may have considerable consequences for their future employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge talked about examples of misconduct that could lead to entry on the list and cited the example—in contrast to my example—of a person acquiescing in the use of illegal drugs. Clearly, aiding or abetting in the use of illegal drugs is against the law, but what about a teacher who decides not to report the 16 or 17-year-old who was found using so-called soft drugs to the police? That happens in many public schools; indeed, it may be the school's general ruling not to report someone who uses so-called soft drugs, but to change that person's behaviour. Would that teacher's action constitute acquiescing in the use of drugs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, as the hon. Lady hypothesises, it is the policy of the school to take such action, the person who followed that policy could hardly be dismissed for misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be surprised if such action is the written policy of many schools or is laid down in the school prospectus. However, if some kids are found smoking pot, many schools will not march them down to the police station, but instead warn them that they must not do it again or they will be in trouble. Such schools take a realistic rather than punitive attitude towards such activity. If the matter blew up in the newspapers, however, the head may decide that that was grounds for dismissing the teacher because it was giving the school bad publicity.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
We can all think of cases of misconduct that would lead to a child being at risk, so the person committing that misconduct should be included on the list. Some cases could be described as cases of misconduct, that may lead to harm. Someone may take a more draconian attitude to the use of drugs, saying that they lead to harm and that the person involved should be taken to the police station.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Syms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I develop the point that I was making a little earlier about someone in charge of a home? If a girl was going out on the streets, the head of the home might say to her, "I do not want you to go out, but if you do, for goodness' sake use a condom, because there are many nasty things that you can catch these days. Please practice safe sex." Would that be encouragement, or would it be good advice? How would a tribunal view it? It could be misinterpreted; it is a difficult question.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed difficult, which is why I moved the amendment. I think that the terms "misconduct" and "at risk of harm" are too widely drawn. I am worried that people may be drawn into the net whom any reasonable person would consider unlikely to be a lifelong danger to children. In fact, given the criteria for being on the list, I suspect that most parents, in their parenting role, could end up on it. Indeed, the hon. Member for Poole reminded us that many parents know that their under-age teenage children are sexually active. If a parent says to a teenager "I do not approve of what you are doing—it is not very sensible—but if you are going to do it for goodness' sake take these contraceptives", it could be construed as misconduct leading to the risk of harm to the child. All sorts of other things that parents might do could put them on the list if they were subject to the provisions.<br><br>
I am wary of the fact that the Bill's sponsor keeps saying that our concerns will be dealt with later in the Bill and that we will then be satisfied. If the hon. Member for Stourbridge means that she will accept some of the later amendments, which would narrow those definitions a little and make it less likely that someone could be put on the list wrongly, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment, which I clearly shall have to do because if I pressed it to a vote it would not be accepted. It would help if the hon. Lady would let us know soon that she would be willing to accept some of the amendments that have been tabled in the names of other hon. Members. We are trying to make the Bill fairer to those wrongly included on the list. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems a formidable list of amendments, but most of them are consequential. Some amendments would leave out "incompetence", and others would insert "gross" or "serious" before "incompetence".<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge can suggest an improvement to this provision. It became clear on Second Reading that this is a crucial matter, and I think that all members of the Committee are keen to legislate. It is important to avoid making amendments to a private Member's Bill on Report, but unless the Committee can come up with a solution, some hon. Members, if not members of the Committee, will be tempted to table further amendments to clause 2. It would be a pity if the Bill got bogged down on Report.<br><br>
People will have no difficulty in putting someone firmly on the list who has committed offences against children and is likely to continue to commit offences. However, there is no evidence that those who omit to do something through incompetence will always be incompetent in a particular situation. In most circumstances, the behaviour of people who abuse children does not change, but someone's competence changes frequently. We all know that we are incompetent occasionally, but we hope that we are not incompetent too often. Therefore, to state that someone who is incompetent in looking after children must be included on the list is extremely dangerous.<br><br>
Drugs were mentioned when we debated amendment No. 57, but one of the most difficult problems for those who run children's homes to deal with is the behaviour of children. In particular, when children of both sexes are involved. People who run homes are often under

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
considerable pressure from those youngsters to let them behave in totally inappropriate ways. If one is responsible for looking after those children in the evening, it can be a nightmare to try to stop boys getting into girls' bedrooms and vice versa.<br><br>
The organisation running the home might well tell someone who is on duty in the evening to be much stricter with the children. The organisation can go through a whole procedure, but the conclusion might be that that individual is simply not capable of controlling those 13 or 14-year-olds in that children's home. That person is clearly incompetent and he or she should not continue to work in that children's home in those circumstances.<br><br>
Are we saying that that person is totally unsuitable to work with children ever again? I do not believe that that is necessarily the case. Ten or 15 years later, that person might have the maturity and authority to return to exactly the same situation and, by force of personality, stop young people misbehaving sexually. Someone like that could be employed in many other circumstances.<br><br>
Under the Bill, if the organisation dismisses that individual because of his or her failure to maintain standards in a home, it will have no option but to report that person to the Secretary of State. It might be argued that the Secretary of State and the tribunal will consider those circumstances, but one of the problems is the length of time that someone might be on the provisional list. We shall return to that matter later. It would be far better to state that people must be put on the list because of their misconduct, not because of either their misconduct or their incompetence.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge will accept the deletion of the word "incompetence". If she cannot, I certainly hope that she will sympathetically consider including either the word "gross" or the word "serious". That would make it clear that we are not after those who omit to do things that they should do in particular circumstances. We are after those who misbehave.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish for moving the amendment in such clear terms. He has helpfully set out the parameters of the debate. It is important that we get the clause right now for precisely the reasons that he gave at the beginning of his speech.<br><br>
I started, I confess, by thinking that it would be right to delete the word "incompetence". I concluded that it would not be right to do so for two reasons. First, language in legislation is interpreted by courts; it is not interpreted simply on the basis of how we describe it, notwithstanding the case of Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart. That case still constitutes a narrow judicial intervention into the interpretation of legislation by reference to proceedings in the House. Courts will generally interpret legislation on the basis of what is in front of them, according to the plain meaning of words. We must therefore ask ourselves, what is the plain meaning of the words that we want to put into legislation? We must, as far as possible, try to leave our intentions out of account, and try to focus on what the legislation means.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
We shall be in a definitional mire if we are not careful, but specifying "misconduct or incompetence" is not simply tautology. There is a difference between the two. Misconduct is essentially sins of commission, and incompetence is sins of omission. I recognise that those are not hard and fast definitions. Notional circumstances could arise in which the extent of neglect of an action that should have been taken is not simply a sin of omission, but becomes misconduct because of systematic incompetence. However, we are dealing not with such circumstances alone but with other circumstances, in which incompetence is such as to lead to the claim that someone has brought harm or risk of harm on children, and should therefore be included in the notification procedure.<br><br>
If those two words are not tautological, in including "incompetence", we have something in mind. The question then becomes, is it reasonable to exclude it? Is it reasonable to require an employer to notify someone who has been incompetent to the point where a child has been harmed or placed at risk of harm? For me, the answer is yes, we should arrive at that point.<br><br>
The next question is, should we arrive at that point for any circumstances in which incompetence has led to such an outcome? Many such circumstances may arise. The test is not whether someone in the course of their employment or otherwise has been incompetent so as to cause harm or risk of harm to a child, but whether someone has been dismissed for that reason. Other circumstances may arise, but they are analogous to dismissal.<br><br>
We may, therefore, be considering circumstances in which someone is dismissed on grounds of what might be called serious or gross incompetence—we shall discuss the difference between those two later. However, many other circumstances may arise, in which people leave employment, are changed to different positions or are dismissed for reasons that do not, strictly speaking, relate to such an instance. In such circumstances, an employer will none the less on prudential grounds argue that the incompetence that led to harm or risk of harm was a factor contributing to the change of an employee's position, to his resigning or retiring at that point, or to the fact that he was going to be dismissed. We can identify several circumstances in which employers might have a responsibility to make a notification about incompetence that might not necessarily constitute the sort of gross incompetence that would of itself lead to dismissal. It might be a contributory factor, but at a lesser level.<br><br>
My second reason for being chary of removing "incompetence" is that, after receiving notification that a person has been incompetent so as to cause harm or risk of harm to a child, it does not automatically follow that the Secretary of State will include that person on the list. The Secretary of State has a second test—that the individual is unsuitable to work with children. A de minimis test will apply. It may, perhaps rightly, become the practice of employers to make notifications on several occasions, more than have been made to the consultancy index, for example, in the past. The Secretary of State will, in effect, apply a de minimis test to the circumstances—not that someone has been wholly blameless, but that the amount of blame to be attached arising from incompetence is so minimal that it does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
render the person unsuitable to work with children. That is a safeguard. Removing the word "incompetence" would exclude the Secretary of State from reviewing cases that should be reviewed because of the sins of omission.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
When I considered whether we should leave the word "incompetence" in the Bill, I concluded that incompetence can occur in very many instances at a modest level of guilt and blame. The Secretary of State could end up with an enormous number of cases that must be decided on qualitative grounds—which are not expressed in the legislation. Someone may not be unsuitable to work with children even though he or she may have been responsible for incompetence that led to harm to children. We do not want to be put in that position if we can avoid it, so we should set out plainly what we intend.<br><br>
Our intention should be that notification to the Secretary of State should occur when there has been serious or gross incompetence. I am not qualified to say what a court will judge as serious or gross incompetence, but most of us would recognise it when we saw it. The sin of omission is when a person reasonably should have seen the harm that could occur and failed to act to prevent it. Gross incompetence is language that conveys that, although the hon Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding), who will speak to amendment No. 50, may think that the word "serious" conveys it. There may be certain difficulties in linguistic definitions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the words "serious" and "gross" are interchangeable, or is he suggesting that there is a gradation between the two?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am working on the basis that the two words are interchangeable. The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme and I did not have a chance to discuss amendments—we probably tabled ours at much the same time. Gross incompetence is a form in which I have seen the language used in the past. If I were to distinguish between the two, gross incompetence seems to me not to require an additional test of what is or is not serious. The courts are used to something being referred to as gross or not gross; it is a sort of black-and-white test applied by them.<br><br>
If something is serious, there is the question of what criteria to apply to determine the level of seriousnesss. We are not proposing to apply a test of what is serious. The courts will have to decide, so it would be better to use language that offers a yes or no solution, rather than to require courts to make calculations on criteria that will not be set out in the Bill.<br><br>
I do not support amendment No. 2, which would delete the word "incompetence". I prefer amendment No. 39, which I tabled, or amendment No. 50, tabled by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Golding</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to amendment No. 50 and consequential amendments Nos. 51, 52, 53 and 54. I agree with everything that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire has said. It is a matter of choosing the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
right word. I cannot agree that the word "incompetence" should be withdrawn from the Bill. There can be incompetence when there is no misconduct.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) introduced a private Member's Bill, dealing with the control and regulation of adventure training holidays. It became the Activity Centres (Young Persons Safety) Act 1995. Members of the Committee may remember a serious case in Plymouth when a group of children went out in a boat and many of them were drowned because of the lack of training, the unseaworthiness of the boat and the absence of lifejackets. My hon. Friend introduced his Bill to prevent that from happening again.<br><br>
The owner of the adventure training holiday scheme was guilty of criminal misconduct because he knew that the boats were unseaworthy and that he should be doing much more. That was serious, criminal misconduct—and something happened to him. However, the actions of the person who took the children out in the boat seem to have been based more on incompetence than misconduct. He was obeying the owner's instructions; the owner was responsible for ensuring that the equipment was seaworthy and that the children were safe in it. The man who took the children out was incompetent because he did not realise the seriousness of the situation and did not question his own actions. He did not think that it was his responsibility to do so. He was completely unsuitable for the job of looking after children, because he was incapable of understanding his own unsuitability. Incompetent, not criminal, is the word to describe him; he did not intend to harm the children, he was just incompetent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. There are many circumstances in which people are incompetent. Most of us are incompetent, but if we are incompetent at an activity all the time, we should stop performing it. Most people take steps to ensure that. Someone who gets into difficulty while performing an outdoor pursuits activity—hopefully, not as severe a difficulty as in the hon. Lady's example—should be dismissed. However, the clause provides that if someone is guilty of incompetence, perhaps at the age of 17 or 18, he or she should never again be allowed to work with children. That is going too far. Incompetence is reasonable grounds for dismissal, but an individual may learn from his or her experience, become more competent and then be suitable for work with children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Golding</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the head; if we are incompetent, we realise it and take steps to do something about it and to protect children in our care. The man in my example did not do that; he did not have the experience to do so and he simply did not see the danger in which he placed the children. That was serious incompetence and such a person should never again be put in the position of making judgments about children's safety. Whether we call such actions gross incompetence or serious incompetence—I accept the point of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire that the term we use has legal implications and that we should use the one that is clearer in court—we need to keep "incompetence" in the legislation.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Lady has been on the same kind of courses as I have, where one is told about a learning ladder. One goes from unconscious incompetence, where one does not know enough about an activity to know that one is not competent at it—one has perhaps never done it before—to conscious incompetence, where one knows that one is doing something incorrectly, but one does not care or is reckless. Are we not trying to differentiate between unconsciously incompetent and consciously incompetent individuals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Golding</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only time that I have been in that position is when I was fishing—I was blinkin' certain that I was not competent because I was not catching any fish and so tried harder. I do not really accept the hon. Lady's distinction. It does not change the fact that "incompetence" needs to be included, whether we qualify it as "serious" or as "gross". Incompetence is very different from misconduct and removing it as a category will harm the Bill and detract from its purpose, which is to protect children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the three arguments that have been made. I agree that the incompetent discharge of duties in relation to the care of children must be addressed. However, I am not convinced that the Bill is the appropriate vehicle for dealing with that problem.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Taunton raised an interesting matter. She talked about incompetence amounting to recklessness that results from people continuing to perform duties that they know they are incompetent to perform. I agree that that is a serious matter, but I suspect that in most situations recklessness amounts to misconduct, and would therefore be covered by the Bill's definition of misconduct, if incompetence were removed from clause 2.<br><br>
That matter was well rehearsed on Second Reading. The list will have a considerable stigma attached to it. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) said that the tabloid press would describe the list as a perverts list. People who are guilty of a momentary lapse or incompetence in a broader sense must be dealt with, but they should not be stigmatised in the same way as people who actively abuse children. I therefore find the arguments of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish more persuasive than those of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme.<br><br>
Misconduct alone does not warrant someone being placed on the list, especially as amendment No. 1 has been withdrawn. A person who is included on the list by virtue of incompetence will have no opportunity to be removed from it after their initial appeal to the tribunal. That means that 10, 20, or even 30 years after such an inclusion, the Secretary of State will have no opportunity to recognise that youthful incompetence has matured into something quite different. I am happy to be corrected if my interpretation of that process is mistaken.<br><br>
Earlier, I said that the Bill is not a comprehensive solution to the problem. It must deal with misconduct. The problem of incompetence must be handled differently, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
is better addressed by requiring appropriate qualifications and by professional regulation of areas in which people work with children.<br><br>
The Government have signalled that they intend to go down that route in the medium term, ensuring that those working with the vulnerable are properly registered, controlled and qualified. Will the Minister tell us how those ideas will interact with the Bill's proposals? What is the time scale for those proposals?<br><br>
The Bill would make more progress and would have a greater chance of succeeding if it were narrowly focused and recognised that issues that need to be addressed, such as incompetence, would be better dealt with by other means. The amendment is critical to our consideration of the Bill, as many of the tests that are imposed must be much more stringent if incompetence is included in the list of crimes and misdemeanours warranting a person's inclusion in it.<br><br>
I suspect that many Members will intervene on Report if incompetence is left in the Bill. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish made a tactical argument for keeping a narrow focus in the Bill, so as to ensure success on Report against what might be called the libertarian tendency. That is a powerful argument in itself, but there is also a philosophical argument for making a clear distinction between incompetence—which can be overcome by education, learning and maturing—and misconduct, which, to my mind, implies a character defect or a personality trait.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to address a core aspect of the Bill. I discovered on Second Reading that this aspect worried Members on both sides of the House. I have given it close attention. The areas of abuse and harm to children that I purposely omitted from my speech in the Chamber were harrowing. They were horrifying, and I chose not to use them. The underlying concern was to stop children being harmed.<br><br>
The points that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has just brought up are fundamental to the way that I have approached the amendment. In view of the huge knowledge and experience that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme has in these matters, I believe that I should accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—amendment No. 2. I have been persuaded that serious and gross incompetence would be covered by misconduct because it is the basis on which an employer refers to the list. The organisations that will refer names have a wide and varying view of what incompetence might be, which obviously raises real concerns. I said that I would wish to balance within my Bill the rights of the individual and the rights of the child. I recognise that the Bill cannot be comprehensive; I said so on Second Reading. I see this as a building block and the way that we must go to protect our children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the remarks that I intended to make need not be made because of the hon. Lady's gracious acceptance of the amendment, but it is worth putting on the record the reason why I put my name to the amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
When I was 21, I was a trainee social worker. That was some years ago, and social work practice has improved greatly since then. I had a large case load of children on the at risk register. That would not now happen to an unsupervised trainee social worker. Any number of children on the at risk register for whom I was responsible could have come to serious harm as a result of the actions of their parents. One parent would ring me regularly, saying "I'm dangling Charlene out of the 24th floor tower block window and if you don't get round in half an hour, I'll drop her." Of course I would tear around, and it was not because of my skill or experience that any of the children on my case load did not come to serious harm; it was more luck than judgment or more by the grace of God.<br><br>
It could be argued that my employers were guilty of incompetence in not realising that someone so inexperienced and immature should not have had that amount of responsibility, but that was fairly common practice in social work in those days. If one of those children had come to serious harm I could have been on this list, if incompetence had remained in the clause. I could not have had the career that I have had working with children in other spheres ever since. That personal knowledge and experience led me to believe that it was inappropriate to have the term incompetent and to be able to draw in so widely a net of people who would not by any stretch of the imagination deliberately harm or abuse children, but might have acted out of inexperience or immaturity, or have lacked appropriate supervision. I am delighted that the hon. Lady feels able to accept the amendment, which I think will improve the Bill. Those of us who have not pressed previous amendments to a vote may feel more comfortable now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be appropriate for me now to support my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge in her acceptance of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme that I should not give that support if I thought that the amendment would compromise either the architecture of the Bill—the foundations on which we want to build better protection for children—or the protection that the Bill will provide. I do not believe that the amendment will diminish protection for children.<br><br>
We have carefully examined the matter at the Department of Health. Perhaps it will reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge and other hon. Members—including the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, who expressed reservations about amendment No. 2—to know that we have examined the cases on the list and have been unable to produce any examples of incompetence that would merit inclusion on the list in their own right but would not also fall within the definition of misconduct. We have never intended low levels of incompetence to lead to inclusion on the list. We are satisfied that reliance on cases of misconduct will suffice to protect children. Hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme, gave many examples of gross incompetence, which can, we feel, be dealt with in the category of misconduct. We are satisfied that the Bill remains robust and strong even with the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I explain my one reservation? I accept that gross or serious incompetence amounts to misconduct in all the circumstances that the Minister has examined. The clause covers an organisation's dismissal of an individual for misconduct—and as amended it would be only misconduct—
<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not in the course of his employment".</p></blockquote>
It is not clear to me whether an employer who was considering dismissing someone could focus on misconduct, which might include an assumption of duty to the employer and dereliction of that duty, as distinct from incompetence, which might have relevance outside the duty to the employer, and dismiss a person on those grounds.<br><br>
I worry that the employer will say that the grounds are misconduct, and that relates to the duty that the person has towards him as an employer and any decision to dismiss him. We want to arrive at circumstances where incompetence could be the grounds for dismissal and notification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart and all the background, I shall try to choose my words carefully. What we always had in mind with respect to conduct outside the course of employment was conduct by an employee that raised a question as to his or her suitability to work with children. It is perfectly possible that such behaviour would be considered by an employer in deciding whether to dismiss the employee on grounds of misconduct. That is perfectly well established in employment law and practice, and I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's example raises a substantive concern for the Committee.<br><br>
We feel confident in recommending the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some difficulty because I am not sure of the consequences of removing "incompetence". I do not know whether I need to press the matter further because the major issue has been tackled. The definition of "serious" has already been discussed. Therefore, I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time on the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's confusion in view of the acceptance of amendment No. 2. However, amendment No. 3 still has merit.<br><br>
Inclusion in the register is serious and will carry a stigma. That should not be trivialised. When we consider the measure, we are discussing serious harm to children. The examples that have been given are invariably of serious harm.<br><br>
A person who is in charge of children may be guilty of misconduct if he acquiesces in illegal, under-age consumption of alcohol. That misconduct may cause a statutory authority to dismiss the person, regardless of the seriousness of the consequence. However, when considering inclusion in the list, there is a difference between acquiescing in a child's illegal consumption of a glass of wine and agreeing to or organising an all-night vodka drinking party in which people pass out and regain consciousness 12 or 16 hours later. The latter poses a serious risk to children's welfare. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Taunton comments from a sedentary position. The example was suggested to me by an article that I read in a Sunday newspaper about alleged drinking in a well known and expensive public school.<br><br>
The Bill should provide for a test of serious harm, not of minimal risk. We all accept that drinking any alcohol could put a 15-year-old child at some risk, but I would not feel comfortable about including someone on the list when the risk to the child as minimal. Therefore, I urge the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish to press the amendment, and other members of the Committee to support it.<br><br>
There is also a tactical argument. Including the word "serious" in the Bill would tackle some of the objections that were made on Second Reading.<br><br>
However, if the amendment is accepted there will be a technical defect in the Bill. I readily acknowledge that I shall be chastised by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish for not having tackled the problem by tabling a further amendment. However, there may be such an opportunity on Report. The defect is that the word "serious" would be inserted before the word "harm" and the clause would state:
<br><blockquote><p>"misconduct…which seriously harmed a child or placed a child at risk of serious harm".</p></blockquote>
If the child had merely been placed at risk, it would have to be risk of serious harm. If the child had actually been harmed, the seriousness test would not apply. To make it consistent, it would therefore be necessary to insert the word "seriously" before harm, so that the clause would state:
<br><blockquote><p>"misconduct…which seriously harmed a child or placed a child at risk of serious harm".</p></blockquote>
I hear intakes of breath; perhaps I am proposing something that would have a greater consequence that I realise, but it would be necessary merely to ensure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
consistency. The form of words appears several times in the Bill, and a consequential amendment would have to be considered on Report. I hope that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will press the amendment and that the Committee will support it.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish to withdraw the amendment, as I cannot accept it in the light of accepting my hon. Friend's previous amendment, which has serious consequences for the Bill's direction and focus. It is worth bearing in mind the definition of harm in the Children Act 1989. The Bill should remain robust and strong—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is rather a mean intervention, but I ask my hon. Friend to read out the definition of harm in the Children Act 1989.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to do so. It is an important definition, and well worth remembering. The Children Act 1989 defines harm as
<br><blockquote><p>"ill treatment or the impairment of health or development; 'development' means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'health' means physical or mental health; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'ill treatment' includes sexual abuse and forms of ill treatment which are not physical."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that my hon. Friend has finished her response. Reading out the words in the Act clarified the issue. I have slight reservations because it is better for words to be in the legislation. I shall consider tabling a further amendment to include the definition in the Bill rather than being referred to another Act, which is unhelpful. However, as I can see from their faces that some Opposition members of the Committee want to vote on the amendment, I shall not withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add one or two comments to this important debate? We risk losing sight of the main features of the Bill and of how someone may end up being permanently included on the list. An employer may be satisfied that an employee has committed an act of misconduct that places, or has placed, a child at risk of harm as defined in the Children Act 1989. The Secretary of State must then be satisfied that that person is unsuitable to work with children. I understand the anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and others, but we must consider the Bill as a whole. Tests must be complied with before a person's name is put on the list permanently, and the Secretary of State must be satisfied that that person is a risk to children. That should reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish about the strength and quality of the Bill and overcome some of his concerns. My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge is therefore right to resist the amendment, which is an unnecessary addition to the Bill: it already contains robust safeguards.<br><br>
On a wider note, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge repeatedly referred to tactics. However, it is important for the Committee not to confuse tactics and principles. Our job is to report back to the House the best

Bill possible based on the principles that govern our deliberations—and our fundamental principle is how best to protect children. That is what should inform our debate, not an individual's perception of the best tactics.<br><br>
We want the best possible legislation; I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge will deliver that. I have tried to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish about the architecture of the Bill and the safeguards built into it. As I said, my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge is right to resist the amendment and to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish to withdraw it.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 2, line 1, after '(b)', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'subject to the proceedings of any tribunal under section 4 below,'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 59, in Clause 4, page 3, line 40, after 'list;', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(aa) a referral made to the Secretary of State under section 2(2)(b) above'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As has been said, reference to the Secretary of State and inclusion on the list will have profound consequences for an individual. It is therefore essential to ensure that people are referred correctly, not maliciously. I am particularly concerned about subsection (2)(b), which deals with circumstances in which individuals have resigned or retired from a post. The organisation can say that if those individuals had not done so, it would have considered dismissing them. However, that test for inclusion on the list is set too low.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge will argue that, in some cases where individuals are known to have or thought to have abused or harmed a child, the organisation would prefer them to go quietly than to make a fuss and draw attention to the institution. Thus a deal may be done. The person quietly resigns and may then find work somewhere else where he can continue to abuse children. I accept that the hon. Lady wants to prevent that from happening; so do I.<br><br>
However, I am worried that entry on the list, albeit provisional at first, is not for a defined period of time, after which a tribunal would have to be held if an appeal is lodged. There are amendments seeking to limit the time that a person can be on the list before a tribunal must hear
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
the matter. In the meantime, that person cannot work in any child care organisation, which may be the only profession in which he has experience. The purpose of amendment No. 58 is to make entry on the list subject to the outcome of a tribunal process, so that the tribunal would take place before, rather than after, a person had been put on the list. That would apply in circumstances where an employer referred the person for inclusion on the list for the sole reason that he would have been dismissed if he had not resigned. Amendment No. 59 is a linking amendment, consequential on amendment No. 58.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady that clause 2(2)(b) is unsatisfactory. Later amendments will address that. However, with great respect to her, I do not believe that her proposal would do what she thinks it would do. It does not put the tribunal into the proceedings at an early stage, as she has suggested. Clause 4—to which amendment No. 59 pertains—does not deal with appeals against a referral by an employer, as does clause 2(2). It deals with appeals against a decision by the Secretary of State to place a person on the list. An employer will determine that a person would have been dismissed had he not resigned, and will refer his name to the Secretary of State, who will then look at the facts and consider whether to include him on the list. If he is to be included, that person would then have a right of appeal to the tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to what my hon. Friend says, but I am not quite in agreement with him.<br><br>
Although the hon. Member for Taunton referred to amendment No. 59 as consequential on amendment No. 58, that is not really the case. In effect, amendment No. 58 is consequential on amendment No. 59. Amendment No. 59 gives an individual the right to go to a tribunal to appeal against a referral to the Secretary of State, rather than against a decision by the Secretary of State. I do not necessarily agree with the hon. Lady, but we shall come to that later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for drawing my attention to that point. It is always useful to be in Committee with him, because he has an eye for detail that I do not always possess.<br><br>
Clause 2 deals with the grounds on which an employer may make a referral to the Secretary of State. It seems to come at a later stage in the chronology for the Secretary of State to determine whether the person should be included on the list, and for that person then to appeal. Before my hon. Friend intervened, I was making the point that this is not an appropriate place to do what the hon. Member for Taunton seeks to do. There are better ways to deal with the problem that she has identified, and we shall have an opportunity to do so when we consider other amendments later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be worth pointing out to the hon. Member for Taunton something of the structure of how a person gets on to the list, and what happens from there.<br><br>
An employer takes action against an employee on any of the four grounds itemised in the Bill—dismissal, retirement, transfer and suspension—on the basis of an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0031">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
individual having harmed, or there having been a risk of harm. Only if any of those criteria are met can a name be put forward. An appeal and tribunal procedure would follow. It is important that those steps stay as they are, because the ultimate sanction is the independent tribunal system. This must work properly and smoothly.<br><br>
In my view, the proper role of a tribunal is to determine appeals against decisions by the Secretary of State. The Bill provides for this.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Stourbridge rather than the hon. Member for Taunton, for two reasons. The first is that the hon. Member for Stourbridge was right to say that the role of the tribunal is consistent throughout the structure—the architecture, as the Minister described it—of the Bill: the tribunal is there to review decisions made by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The second is that the hon. Member for Taunton is attempting in her amendment to make the referral of a person to the Secretary of State a substantive event in itself which ought to be able to be reviewed by the tribunal. But it is obviously the Secretary of State's role to reach a decision on the merits or otherwise of a referral, and it does not automatically follow that it will lead to inclusion in the list.<br><br>
There is a further reason. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who underestimates himself—I have been a member of a Committee with him and have seen him reach detail that I have not even attempted—has noticed that amendment No. 59 is defective in that, were it to add referral to the Secretary of State to the circumstances in which an appeal to a tribunal could be undertaken, an internal contradiction in the structure of clause 4 would be created. Clause 4(1) states that only
<br><blockquote><p>"an individual who is included otherwise than provisionally in the list kept by the Secretary of State … may appeal"</p></blockquote>
to the tribunal. If the phrase "otherwise than provisionally" were replaced, amendment No. 59 might be viable. It is defective because the provisional listing is not the basis upon which an appeal can be made to the tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It must be obvious that I am not a lawyer, but perhaps this place has enough of them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge pointed out that there were four reasons for an individual getting on to the list. I felt that one of them was less of a hurdle than the other three. When a person is put on the list and decides to appeal, we have no idea how long he must wait for the appeal date and the tribunal's decision. Most of us do a great deal of case work for constituents who appeal to tribunals for different reasons, and we know that a long time can elapse before a tribunal hears an appeal. While a person on this list awaits the tribunal's decision, he wil be denied an opportunity to work in the profession that he may have practised for years.<br><br>
The hurdle in clause 2(b) is less difficult: it is much more serious for an employer to dismiss an employee, transfer him to another job or suspend him than to say,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
when he has left his job, "If he had not left of his own accord, I would have got rid of him anyway." Having to refer an employer to the Secretary of State is not a strict test for an employer to have to pass. What I tried to achieve with my allegedly faulty amendment was to say that if a person was referred on those grounds the tribunal process could begin immediately instead of the Secretary of State putting his name on the list, allowing him to appeal, and the person having to wait for the tribunal to decide whether his entry on the list was justified. As I said, I am not a lawyer and if, as everyone says, the amendments are defective, it would not be clever to press them to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 2, leave out

<br><blockquote><p>'or would have considered dismissing him.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just considered picking up the bottle that is in front of me and smashing it over the head of my hon. Friend the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That would be serious misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether you would make a judgment on such action, Mr. Wells. Actually, I was hoping that you would remain quiet and judge whether it was likely that I would so that.<br><br>
Under the clause, an organisation has to refer someone for inclusion on the list after it has considered the matter. It is not a matter of whether there is a likelihood of such action happening, but of whether dismissal had passed through the organisation's mind. For example, I considered using the bottle, but I had quickly dismissed it from my mind before you called me to order, Mr. Wells. One must judge whether my using it was a real possibility. That is the problem with the provision. It is not a question of whether the organisation thought that the person should have been dismissed, but whether it would have considered dismissing that person.<br><br>
If the tribunal were judging whether an organisation had considered dismissing someone, it would consider the evidence. Under the Bill, as soon as the procedure is set up, the trigger mechanism would be activated and the organisation would have to make a referral. I accept that, at the end of the process, the Secretary of State may make a judgment and further down the line, in respect of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
permanent list, the tribunal will have the opportunity to make a recommendation. It is dangerous to say that a referral can be made if an organisation has merely considered dismissing that person without it having to qualify how seriously it thought about it. Such a provision would be unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the Bill's current wording? The clause is trying to cover cases of employees who resign or retire before the employer has had the opportunity to consider dismissing them. If my hon. Friend's amendment were accepted, such cases could not be referred to the Secretary of State. The employee who resigns quickly before the employer has had the opportunity to consider dismissing him could bypass the Bill and continue to work with children even though he was unsuitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not correct. The clause states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The individual has resigned or retired in circumstances such that the organisation would have dismissed him".</p></blockquote>
That covers the point made by my hon. friend the Under-Secretary. If the grounds were such that the organisation was considering dismissing that person—it was somewhere between a remote possibility and a mere certainty—the clause would be reasonable. But leaving the grounds so vague, and requiring merely that the idea had gone through the mind of the organisation that such action might be appropriate, is not the best way in which to draft the provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman as concerned as I am that it will be unlawful for an employer not to refer someone to the list? An employer may err on the side of caution if it has passed through is mind that he might dismiss a person, as it passed through the mind of the hon. Gentleman to pick up the bottle. The employer may think that he has a legal obligation to refer that person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the way I read the provision. I am willing to admit that I am no lawyer. I should be pleased to hear from the lawyers on the Conservative Benches and from my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely a member of an organisation would have to make a complaint. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is right: an organisation should not be asked to consider something if it was not involved in the dismissal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the wording of subsection (2)(b). The best thing that I can do so that the proceedings are not prolonged is to listen to my hon. Friend's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I agree that it is absolutely essential to retain the phrase "would have dismissed". Such matters came sharply into focus during the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. Many people think that there is something wrong with a system that allows people to escape disciplinary proceedings by resigning just before they are begun.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
However, we are talking about a much weaker test, involving the use of the phrase "would have considered dismissing him".<br><br>
Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, the issue is clear. An organisation faced with someone who resigns in circumstances that are relevant to the Bill will have to ask itself whether it would have dismissed that person. The organisation might have to undertake its normal disciplinary procedure against that person, in absentia. That procedure might have led to the dismissal of that person if he had not chosen to resign. The organisation must decide whether it honestly believes that it would have dismissed him if it would have done so, it must report that fact to the Secretary of State. It is not unreasonable to ask an employer to undertake that procedure and decide definitively whether or not it would have dismissed the person. It is not sufficient to determine that it would have considered dimissing him, which means almost nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Syms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been involved with local authorities that have undertaken such procedures. The individual has the right to have his say or to be represented. Indeed, there are often appeals. If an individual resigns, goes abroad or does not co-operate with an organisation that wants to undertake those procedures, there will be no natural justice because the individual will not be questioned and will not give evidence. How will that problem be overcome?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree that difficulties would arise if an individual did not co-operate. However, it would not be impossible for employers to review the facts and reach a reasonable decision as to whether they believed that, on the balance of the evidence available, they would have dismissed the employee. I strongly suspect that, under the Bill as drafted, the Secretary of State will assess the available evidence and decide for himself whether it is likely that the person would have been dismissed if they had not resigned. The practical difficulty mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole is not insuperable.<br><br>
Unfortunately, having argued eloquently for the deletion of the term "would have considered dismissing him", the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish has inadvertently included that phrase in amendment No. 38. Although he wants to delete it from subsection (2)(b), he is trying to include it in what would be subsection (2)(e). I am sure that that is not what he wants to do. I suggest that, if we do not get that far today, it might be appropriate for him to withdraw that amendment and submit it in redrafted form. The amendment would have a great deal to commend it if the reference to an employer who "would have considered dismissing" were removed.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel strongly that I cannot accept the amendment. There are countless examples of abusers slipping away and moving on to other places because somebody has started to uncover them but has not been able to continue with that procedure. I feel passionately that the amendment would keep open a loophole that is being cruelly exploited.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0033">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady help the Committee by explaining what to her mind is the difference between "would have dismissed" someone—the situation that I think that she was describing—and "would have considered dismissing" someone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made many points that I would have made. I accept that there appears to be a fine definition, but we have to allow employers to report people whom they consider on the balance of probability to be abusers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any members of the Committee are arguing against that. Will the hon. Lady accept that the Bill as drafted does not merely permit employers to report someone who on the balance of probability is an abuser, but requires them to report someone whom they would have considered dismissing? If an incident had occurred prior to the resignation that, under the normal disciplinary procedures of employers, would have had to give rise to such consideration, that resignation would have to be reported even if it was apparent to employers that they would not then have gone on to dismiss the person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is a requirement. It is an important instrument for the employer. Employers who are involved in child care must be required to take responsibility. It is important to put the onus on them to investigate in the way in which I have outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady entirely. Will she not accept that we are arguing for that? Requiring employers to go further and decide not merely that they "would have considered dismissing", but that, having regard to the facts, the probably "would have dismissed" is not too much to ask of them—not too many hoops to ask them to jump through—if that will assist the protection of children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am struggling with the semantics of language.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. We are trying to ensure that this part of the Bill covers all the scenarios that might arise in such cases. My hon. Friend will agree that we want to ensure that the informing organisation could refer someone to the Secretary of State if it would consider dismissing that individual but had not concluded whether it would be appropriate to do so, due to the individual resigning or retiring. We need the dual wording of "would have dismissed" and "would have considered dismissing" because an employee might have retired before the first of the two conclusions had been reached.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for that intervention. I wish that he had gone on a bit longer because I need more time to think things through. Every member of the Committee is engaged in the same endeavour and wants to reach the same end point. We must also bear in mind the threshold of harm as defined in the Children Act 1989.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Syms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raised with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge the point about going through the procedures and perhaps not having the co-operation of the individual involved. However, is there not a slight risk that we shall give too much power to some employers? Malicious employers exist, and trade unions sometimes have good reasons for representing employees at appeals. A Conservative councillor persuaded me of the contribution that trade unions can make for employees.<br><br>
It might not be appropriate now, but we must consider such issues carefully. In some private organisations there may be disputes over money or other matters. It is very easy to pick on an individual. We hear much about the bullying of employees these days, and the provisions of the clause could be thrown into a dispute over money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was always my intention that the Bill should have sufficient checks and balances so that the rights of individuals are met. The process of provisionally listing or finally listing someone will involve appeals and tribunals that will adequately resolve the hon. Gentleman's fear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the circumstances that the Minister and the hon. Lady mentioned. As I understand it, we must consider subsection 2(b) along with 2(d), and we must realise that several sets of circumstances apply.<br><br>
An event might come to light that leads an employer to conclude that one of his employees has abused children. In such a case, the employer's responsibility will be to suspend that person pending an inquiry, and the provisions of subsection 2(d) will apply.<br><br>
Subsection 2(b) contains the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"would have considered dismissing him".</p></blockquote>
That will relate to circumstances in which an employer discovers that an event occurred that would have forced him to consider dismissing someone who had already resigned or left the employment. That is different from the test in subsection 2(a).<br><br>
If the Minister is seriously suggesting that the proper test of whether someone should be notified is not whether he has been dismissed, suspended or transferred to a non-child-care position but whether his employer has considered such eventualities, that should be made clear in subsection 2(a). It should not appear in subsection 2(b) or deal with circumstances in which someone resigns and the employer asks himself, "Given that we now know what this person did, would we have considered dismissing him?" The answer may be yes in many cases. One test appears in subsection 2(a) and the consequential test in subsection 2(b) should relate to the question whether the employer would have dismissed that person.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said, it may be difficult to get compliance when someone has moved on. However, an employer might consider the evidence available to him and conclude that he would have dismissed a person on the basis of that. If so, there should be no bar on the employer notifying the Secretary of State of that person. However, that person should have the right to provide information to the Secretary of State or to appeal if he thinks that the notification is unjustified.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am looking at the clock and see that seven minutes of our sitting remain. The Committee is in some difficulty, and I would like to persuade my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge to reconsider. If the matter is not resolved before 1 o'clock, we could table another amendment for the next week and my hon. Friend could come up with an alternative proposal. I hope that the Committee will bear that possibility in mind and that you, Mr. Wells will think about when we should adjourn.<br><br>
We must be absolutely clear that the clause does not allow for choice. That is what worries me. Subsection (1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A child care organisation shall,"—</p></blockquote>
that is not discretionary—
<br><blockquote><p>"and any other organisation may, refer to the Secretary of State an individual who is or has been employed in a child care position if any of the following conditions is fulfilled."</p></blockquote>
The conditions are listed in subsection (2). We can forget about paragraph (a), and go straight to paragraph (b), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"that the individual has resigned or retired in circumstances such that the organisation would have dismissed him".</p></blockquote>
That covers the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge<br><br>
I believe passionately that people should not be able to take the easy option, slip away simply by resigning, and then disappear. Such people usually reappear, and continue to offend somewhere else.<br><br>
Paragraph (b) adds to the condition,
<br><blockquote><p>"that the individual has resigned or retired in circumstances such that the organisation would have dismissed him",</p></blockquote>
the further condition that the organisation
<br><blockquote><p>"would have considered dismissing him".</p></blockquote>
That is where judgment comes in—and not only a judgment whether there was sufficient evidence to take action. The very fact that the organisation considered taking action, triggers the mechanism. That alarms me, because it means that discretion will have to be exercised, first by the Secretary of State and then, if necessary, by the tribunal.<br><br>
The tribunal will be at a considerable distance—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the test of whether one has considered something is difficult to apply to an organisation? Does it mean, "Has any person in the organisation—any of the managers or other responsible people there—at any time considered that they might have dismissed the person in question?" Is that a fair test to apply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is. When a person resigns or retires early from an organisation, and someone then says, "Something has happened, and we are not happy about it," any responsible organisation has to start considering whether it would have considered dismissing that individual. Once it starts to exercise that judgment by going through the process, it is not left with much of what I understand by the word discretion. I am not a lawyer, and any hon. Member here who is a lawyer may be able to tell me better, but it seems to me that there is an absolute requirement for a child care organisation to do that, without necessarily having made a judgment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None of us is a lawyer.<br><br>
Does the hon. Gentleman think that under that provision, if someone resigned and moved on to work in another child care post for a couple of years, and then a problem in the original organisation put some doubt in the employer's mind along the lines of, "Oh, if I had known that, I might have thought of sacking that man," the organisation would then have to—the word is not "may" or "can", but "shall"—refer that person to the Secretary of State for inclusion on the list? At that point, they would have to be removed from the job in which they were then working. That is my interpretation, and if it is correct, the test seems unfair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is how I interpret the process. We should give a little more thought to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that although the Minister's intervention was helpful in clarifying the Government's thinking, the point that he raised could be better addressed by introducing the test of whether someone would have been suspended, rather than a test involving a judgment whether something would have been considered? That would at least be a concrete test.<br><br>
I understand what the Minister said about wanting to avoid a gap between a person's resignation and the exhaustion of the process through which they would be included on the list—a gap in which they might do harm elsewhere. As paragraph (d) already uses the concept of suspension, we should make use of that concept, which is appropriate here, and ask whether a person would have been suspended. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful suggestion. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge will tell the Committee whether she is prepared to consider the idea, but I sense that in the Committee there are hon. Members who—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everyone else seems to be interrupting my hon. Friend, so I shall do the same. As I tried to say earlier in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge, my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is reading more into the clause than is there. He has every right to do so, but I think that he is wrong.<br><br>
We are trying to ensure that a person cannot retire or resign before the employer comes to a decision—<i>[Interruption.]</i> That situation is not covered by the first part of the provision.</span></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock,</i> THE CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing order.</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned till Wednesday 17 March at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
