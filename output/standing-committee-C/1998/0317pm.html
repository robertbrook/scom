<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Debra Shipley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stourbridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. In the light of this morning's discussion, which raised serious points that would bear further consideration, I should like the Committee to adjourn until next week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I should like to impress on my hon. Friend and on the Minister that if we adjourn today it is important that relevant amendments are ready by Monday. I stress in particular that subsections (2)(b), (c) and (d) need to be clarified. The Committee needs to know what will happen about the important question of the appeal mechanism. A clear statement about legal aid would also be very helpful.<br><br>
As I shall not be present next Wednesday, it would be helpful if another Committee member could table the amendments that have already been accepted for consideration. I would also ask Committee members to look carefully at my new clause 2, which is one mechanism by which pressure could be put on those on the list to make that fact known when applying for jobs. If the Government introduce a list, there will be a great deal of criticism if someone is employed as a nanny or something similar and no mechanism exists for that person to inform their prospective employer that they are on that list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley) for her brief remarks and her request for an adjournment of the Committee. It showed that this morning's discussion was practical and constructive in every respect. I am glad that she has taken on board some of the points that were made. I hope that the spirit of our debate will encourage her to consider this morning's discussions carefully over the next few days. I look forward to hearing her response when we meet next week. I heartily endorse our approach—it is the right way to proceed—and I congratulate the hon. Lady on her sensible decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge for giving the Committee a proper opportunity to reflect on some of the points that were raised today.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
The Government feel that we need to consider the Bill's appeal provisions relating to provisional inclusion on the list. That is why my hon. Friend sought leave to adjourn the Committee. She and I—and other Committee members—will have an opportunity to discuss the best way to proceed.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) re-opened the argument about the phrase "would have considered" in clause 2(2)(b). As I understand it, that is not why my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge sought leave to adjourn the Committee. We want to consider the appeals mechanism, and how it relates to provisional registration and to inclusion on the list.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister on the question of legal aid. Giving people legal aid so that they can be represented at a tribunal is an important safeguard for civil liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's concern, but I am not currently able to make specific comments on that matter. I suspect that we shall return to that matter later—perhaps on Report.</span></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—<i>[Ms Shipley.]</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at twenty-four minutes to Five o'clock till Wednesday 24 March at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
