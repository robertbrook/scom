INCLUSION IN LIST ON REFERENCE TO SECRETARY OF STATE</div> <!-- title -->

<p>No. 13, in page 2, line 37, leave out 'or incompetence'.</p>
<p>No. 17, in page 3, line 9, leave out 'or incompetence'.—[<i>Jackie Ballard.</i>]</p>
<p><b>Question proposed,</b> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Debra Shipley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stourbridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the most important clauses in the Bill, and rightly so, because it has been the focus of a great deal of the Committee's attention. Its purpose is to specify the criteria and procedure for the inclusion of names in the new statutory Department of Health list.<br><br>
Subsection (1) provides that, while child care organisations must refer eligible names, it will be permissible for other organisations also to make references. All references will be treated similarly, regardless of whether they are compulsory or permitted.<br><br>
Subsection (2) provides that individuals eligible for listing who are to be referred by a child care organisation, or who may be referred by any other organisation, are those who have been dismissed, transferred or suspended because they have harmed, or put at risk of harm, a child, or who would have been dismissed, or considered for dismissal on such grounds, had they not resigned or retired. The Committee will recall its decision to amend subsection (2) to omit reference to incompetence from the relevant grounds because it seemed to vague a concept to justify listing.<br><br>
Subsections (3) to (7) set out how references are to be received and determined, including provisionally. They lay down a system of procedural fairness appropriate for the seriousness of the issues at stake. Thus, only after inviting observations from relevant individuals and their employers, and considering all the relevant information before him, will the Secretary of State be obliged to confirm an individual's inclusion on the list if he is of the opinion both that the referring organisation reasonably considered the individual to be guilty of misconduct—whether or not during
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
employment—and that the individual is unsuitable to work with children.<br><br>
Clauses 2(2)(d) provides that, where an organisation suspends or provisionally transfers an individual while investigating allegations of misconduct, the name should be referred to the list and included provisionally, pending the conclusion of the employer's investigations. Subsection (5)(b) and subsection (7) make necessary amendments to the clause to deal with these referrals.<br><br>
Subsection (8) applies the effects of subsection (2), with appropriate modifications in the case of references for employment agencies.<br><br>
I am sure that members of the Committee will agree that the fullest attention has been given to these important provisions. I hope that the clause will stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley) that the clause has been improved very substantially by the removal of the reference to incompetence. However, some members of the Committee remained concerned about subsection (2)(b), which refers to circumstances in which an organisation would consider dismissing someone.<br><br>
We debated that at length and other hon. Members may want to return to the matter on Report.<br><br>
Residual concern also remains about something to which the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) drew attention: instances when information comes to light some time after the relevant person has ceased to be employed in a child care position. It is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the Bill to allow for the possibility of making a reference to the Secretary of State in such a case. The Bill does not as I understand it provide for that. I understand the technical difficulties involved, but I suspect that hon. Members may want to return to that issue, also, on Report to ensure that no holes are left in the fence that we are constructing.<br><br>
Considerable concerns remain about the lack of an appeal mechanism under the clause with respect to provisional inclusion in the list. I note that the hon. Member for Stourbridge has tabled some amendments to be taken later, which will, I hope, deal with that. I am pleased that she has taken on board the concern of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee about the matter.<br><br>
I am still slightly worried about the wording of subsection (6)(a)—and that concern is more than semantic. The test that the provision applies—that the Secretary of State is of the opinion
<br><blockquote><p>"that the organisation reasonably considered the individual to be guilty of misconduct"—</p></blockquote>
is considerably weaker than the test to be applied by the tribunal under clause 4 in the event of an appeal. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
seems odd that names will be confirmed on the list on the basis of the Secretary of State's determination that the referring organisation reasonably considered the individual to be guilty, whereas if that person appeals, the tribunal will base its decision about whether he or she should remain on the list or whether he or she was in fact guilty of misconduct. Owing to the gap between the two tests, it is possible that, after the Secretary of State has correctly put someone on the list under subsection (6)(a), the tribunal may correctly remove that person from it. To my layman's mind that seems a bizarre state of affairs. I should have thought it preferable for the test to be the same in each case. I suspect that hon. Members may want to consider that point further, at leisure, after the Bill has been considered in Committee.<br><br>
I hope that my remarks do not sound churlish, but as the hon. Member for Stourbridge said, the clause is the core of the Bill. To oppose it would be to oppose the principle of the Bill, which I have no intention of doing. I merely point out that, because the clause is essential to the architecture of the Bill, it may be necessary to reconsider later some of the important issues that have already been discussed but, in my view, not satisfactorily resolved. However, in the grand scheme of things and in relation to the overall aims of the Bill, the clause plays a vital part. My concerns are relatively minor, so I shall certainly not oppose the clause standing part of the Bill.</span></p>

<li>a decision by the Secretary of State under subsection (3) to include the individual in the list, or</li>
<li>a decision by the Secretary of State not to include the individual in the list, or</li>
<li>the expiry of a period of six months from the date on which the individual was provisionally included in the list.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 64 in Clause 13, page 9, line 18, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Where—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
<ol>
<li>an individual who is or has been employed in a child care position has been referred by an organisation to the Secretary of State for inclusion in the Consultancy Service Index;</li>
<li>the reference has not been determined at the commencement of section 2 above; and</li>
<li>any of the conditions mentioned in subsection (2) of that section was fulfilled in relation to the reference,</li></ol>

<br><blockquote><p>(1B) For the purpose of subsection (1A) above, a reference of an individual for inclusion in that Index is determined only when, following the reference—
<ol>
<li>the individual is included (otherwise than provisionally) in the Index; or</li>
<li>the Secretary of State determines that he should not be included in it.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My amendments are designed to complete important transitional arrangements, dovetailing the old Department of Health lists with the new list established under clause 2. The overall object is to make provision for the handling of cases referred for inclusion in the consultancy service index that are undetermined when the new list is brought into existence under clause 2.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 make it clear that the arrangements specified in clause 3 for the transfer of names from the consultancy service index apply to names that are included in the index on any grounds other than provisional ones. That includes cases in which a decision has been taken to include the name on a permanent basis. Therefore, cases included provisionally in the index that remain undetermined when clause 2 comes into force are not included in the transfer arrangements under clause 3. Those arrangements are confined to cases in which a decision has been taken to include the name in the index on a permanent basis.<br><br>
Amendment No. 64 addresses the transitional regime for undetermined cases. Essentially, the amendment requires such cases to be treated as if they were new references under clause 2(1). In this way, an orderly transition is established for determined and provisional cases on the consultancy service index and all the protections of the new regime are extended to referred cases that will be determined on the Bill's enactment.<br><br>
If that were not done, cases undetermined when clause 2 comes into force would need to be determined under the old procedure and decisions would have to be taken about whether it would be appropriate to include them in the consultancy service index. Only then could cases be considered for transfer under the procedure specified in clause 3. Logically, it is better to use resources to avoid duplication and to deal with undetermined cases under a single procedure—the most appropriate being that specified in clause 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Lady's amendments, which deal with potential problems in the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
Amendment No. 78, which I tabled, has not been made redundant by amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 64. If I am missing something, I am willing to give way to the hon. Member for Stourbridge. The procedure to be applied to a person caught under clause 3 is inconsistent with the procedure that will be applied to a person referred under clause 2. Under clause 3(2), the Secretary of State must
<br><blockquote><p>"invite observations from the individual… and… observations from the organisation".</p></blockquote>
That applies to individuals already on the list when the Bill is enacted. In that situation there is no provision for a provisional inclusion of that person on the list until completion of that process.<br><br>
We are seeking here to take someone who is already on the list when the Bill comes into force and transfer him, without further question, to the new statutory list, or to take him through a review process, inviting observations and counter-observations, during which time he needs to be provisionally included on the list. As I interpret it, the adoption of amendments Nos. 35 and 36 would mean that an individual who was already on the list when the clause came into force would be subject to the procedure outlined in subsection (2) without any provision for his inclusion on the list in the meantime.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I am desperately hoping that someone will intervene and tell me—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the hon. Gentleman's amendment was tabled and in light of the helpful comments of members of the Committee, I have tabled additional amendments on the provisional listing, which I hope will address his concerns. I believe that they fully spell out what will happen six months after the conclusion of the court case or nine months after the provisional listing, depending on the circumstances. I hope that that clarifies matters a little for the hon. Gentlemen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not entirely, as that refers to a different set of amendments. I am wondering whether the amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 64 make subsections (2) and (3) redundant. Reading those subsections in the context of the hon. Lady's amendments is confusing me. They appear to provide for a consultation process or an invitation of observations by the Secretary of State which would be appropriate only if the Secretary of State was dealing with an undertermined reference. An undertermined reference will no longer concern us here because amendment No. 64. removes it from the scope of the clause. I am therefore not entirely sure what subsections (2) and (3) are still doing there. I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Stourbridge or the Minister would clarify that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
respond specifically to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). I am not sure that he has fully understood the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge or how the clause is intended to work. We envisage those amendments extending the protections of the Bill to the cases that my hon. Friend described. In no sense do her amendments diminish or subtract from the protections that the Bill will provide in these cases.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has raised some technical issues about those amendments and how they relate to the clause. Probably the best way that I can respond to him is to write to him with the reassurances that he seeks. I shall ensure that other members of the Committee see that correspondence, so that any confusion can be dealt with before Report. I know that the hon Gentleman is trying to be helpful in tabling amendment No. 78. However, whatever his intentions, I am not sure that his arguments relate to the amendment, which would simply remove from the list someone in this situation, and the Secretary of State would continue to investigate the matter with a view to permanent inclusion in the list once a decision was taken. That is not a helpful procedure for the Secretary of State to be asked to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My initial reaction was that my amendment was now redundant because of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Stourbridge. It was only because of the confusion in my mind about the effect of subsections (2) and (3) that I rose to speak to the clause.<br><br>
I accept what the Minister says. No issue of principle is at stake. Perhaps I may correspond with the Minister about subsections (2) and (3). I am certain that, if they turn out to be redundant, it will be possible to deal with the matter on Report. If they are not redundant, I am sure that there is a simple explanation that I have not grasped this morning. I look forward to hearing from the Minister about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not expect the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge to make subsections (2) and (3) redundant. However, with the hon. Gentleman's consent, we can deal with the matter in correspondence. As I said, I shall be happy to ensure that all members of the Committee receive a copy of that before correspondence so that, if hon. Members have doubts, we can dispel them before Report.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause governs the way in which transfer from the old Department of Health consultancy service index to the new list is to be accomplished. It will not be an automatic process, whereby a person on the old list is placed on the new one. On the contrary, the clause ensures that transfer attracts the protections that clause 2 extends to people referred for the first time. Thus, not only must entry on the old list have occurred following reference by an organisation, but no one may be considered for transfer unless the conditions of clause 2(2)(a) to (c) are satisfied. Furthermore, where people are eligible to be considered for transfer, the Secretary of State must follow the same procedures for inviting representations and observations and apply the same tests as in the case of entirely new references under clause 2.<br><br>
The provisions are essential to securing procedural fairness. In addition, the amendments that the Committee has made to clause 3, which pave the way for an amendment to clause 13, have helpfully clarified the position of cases referred before the commencement of clause 2 for inclusion in the consultancy service index—the old list—but which remain undetermined when the new list begins. The principle has been to ensure that those cases also benefit from the protections given by clause 2 to new cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am even more confused than I was before. Perhaps I got out of bed on the wrong side this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: You were lucky to get to bed at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says from a sedentary position, there was a time in the House yesterday evening when I did not think that I would get to bed at all, so I suppose I should be grateful for the few hour's sleep that I had.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge confirmed that, before a person on the present list is transferred to the statutory list, there will be a review of the information supplied with the original reference, as provided for in clause 2. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that explanation. It makes much of what I said in the previous debate irrelevant, because subsections (2) and (3) are clearly not redundant. However, it still begs the question: where is the provision in clause 3 that puts someone provisionally on the list on day one of the commencement of the measure while the Secretary of State goes through the procedures, which he says have been deliberately included in subsections (2) and (3), that ensure that someone on the list prior to commencement is not automatically on the new list, but included only after the Secretary of State has jumped through the necessary hoops? As the Minister said earlier, surely it is not the hon. Lady's intention to reduce the level of protection for children provided by the process. Anyone who is on the list on day one of the commencement of the measure should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
immediately included provisionally on the list and then be subject to the process of clarification and review by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I would be grateful if the hon. Lady could show me the relevant passage in the Bill. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) will do it for her.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I can, but I shall try to help my hon. Friend. As I understand the purpose of the previous amendment, when the Bill is enacted, past references to the consultancy list index will be treated as though they will be referred to the new consolidated list that the Secretary of State is to hold under the Bill. That process is by virtue of amendment No. 64 to clause 13—the transitory provisions. In addition, the purpose of clause 3 is to give statutory backing outside the transitory provisions to the Secretary of State in adding people to the list permanently when they have previously simply been referred to the consultancy list index. I think that that is how it works.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend and that is not my understanding of the proposal. I understand that amendment No. 64, which we have now agreed, makes provision for the case of a person who has been referred to the Secretary of State under the old regime, but whose reference has not been determined. I draw my hon. Friend's attention to subsection (1A)(b) of amendment No. 64. In the case of that amendment, we are discussing a reference that was made prior to the commencement date but that has not been determined. It rightly provides that, in those circumstances, a reference made prior to the commencement date would be treated as if it were made after the commencement date. That is entirely reasonable.<br><br>
I am addressing the issue of someone who is on the list prior to the commencement date—perhaps that person has been on the list for 10 years prior to that date. My understanding of what the hon. Member for Stourbridge said is that that person will not automatically go on to the statutory list after the commencement date, but will go on that list only after the Secretary of State has applied the tests in clause 3(2) and (3). Once he has done that, he will put them on the statutory list. My objection is that there is no mechanism for putting them on a provisional list from day one of the commencement of the provision, pending the Secretary of State's determination of the matters referred to in subsections (2) and (3). I am afraid that I am no clearer in my mind now than I was five minutes ago. I hope that the hon. Lady will be able to clarify it for me.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best. The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point and the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire was right in his exposition of how we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
envisage the operation. However, when the Department is moving from one system to the other, there will be a relatively short transitional period—administratively—in which both lists will have to be referred to. Administrators will have to examine several hundred entries. The point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is largely correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady is saying that the new list makes no provision for provisional inclusion and that, therefore, the old list will have to run in parallel, effectively operating as the provisional list until such time as the Secretary of State has carried out the determinations required of him under subsections (2) and (3). Is that what she means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not work in the Department, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware, so it is difficult for me to be completely certain. However, I understand that there would have to be an administrative period of transition when one list was transferred to the other. For only a short time, the two lists would work in parallel. That would provide the best protection and help to provide the checks and balances introduced by the Bill for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether my hon. Friend interrupted the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge or whether he was continuing with his speech. However, it might help if I explain how we envisage clause 3 operating.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is right that there is no procedure for provisional inclusion under the new list. As he acknowledged, those currently on the existing index will remain on it until a decision is taken under the Bill whether to include a person's name on the new list.<br><br>
It is important to understand why we are doing that, because the consequences for a person whose name is included in the new list are serious. It will mean a restriction on that person's ability to be employed in a child care position. In view of those consequences, it is appropriate to follow the most rigorous procedures possible to ensure that we are not unfairly or unreasonably restricting a person's employment opportunities.<br><br>
It remains the case, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge said, that during the transaction period we might expose children to risk. A person will remain on the list and be subject to existing provisions but there will still be a need for protection. There cannot be a ban on employment because that is not the present legal situation: the Bill will allow us to prevent employment in a child care position.<br><br>
The clause provides the best and fairest way of operating transitional arrangements. There will be no automatic transfer to the new list until the full and proper procedures specified in clause 2 have been completed.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister. Presumably the thinking behind his approach is that, as opposed to providing for provisional inclusion, significant numbers of people on the present list will not warrant inclusion in the statutory list. Has the Department estimated what percentage of people whose name is on the present list are likely to be included in the new list?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No is the short answer. It would be unhelpful to the Committee if I were to throw figures around. It is perfectly conceivable that some people on the existing list will not be transferred to the new list. I acknowledge that possibility, but I will not be drawn into a discussion about what percentage of names on the list will not be transferred, because no one knows at this stage.<br><br>
As for how we arrange matters, the criteria for inclusion on the old list are not as strict as the criteria for the new list, which is why people will not be transferred automatically. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that that is appropriate. The Committee has had to strike the right balance between protecting children and not interfering unfairly or unreasonably with the civil liberties of our fellow citizens. We have made it clear that we want to protect children. The transitional arrangements, which govern the transfer from the old list to the new list, will fulfil that objective. We need to treat transfers carefully because the consequences of inclusion on the current and future lists are different. Existing criteria are not as strict as new criteria.<br><br>
I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that the transitional arrangements do not compromise children's safety. A person who is on the old list will remain on it until we have made a decision about transferring him to the new list. Employment organisations will be able to consult us about who is on the existing list, and we will advise them accordingly. There is no need to specify provisional, and therefore automatic, inclusion on the new list. That would not be appropriate or fair, nor would it strike the right balance between civil liberties and child protection issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear the Minister say that his Department has no estimate of how many people will not be transferred to the new list. The burden of his argument is that a significant injustice would be caused by automatically transferring people from the current list to a provisional list under the new arrangements. For that injustice to be significant, there would have to be a significant number of people who are not likely to be transferred from the old list to the new list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned a significant number, and I have tried to address that issue. We have not reviewed everyone who is on the list, so we are not able to give him a figure or percentage. Some people might not be transferred, but I cannot be more specific.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0070">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the proposed method will weaken the level of protection. While people remain on the old list pending transfer to the new list, there will be no ban on their employment. That is a clear weakening of child protection measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the hon. Gentleman is trying to be helpful, and I share his concern that we should protect children properly, but he is asking us to consider how the new list will operate compared with the old list. There is a presumption against retrospectivity. If the hon. Gentleman's point is one of retrospectivity, I would have a problem with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that there are two ways of dealing with the transition. We can either transfer everyone provisionally to the new list and then check to decide whether they should be confirmed on it, or leave them on the old list to be checked and transferred one at a time. If a significant number of people on the old list were not to be transferred to the new list, it would be a significant injustice to transfer all of them wholesale to the new list on a provisional basis. But the suggestion of the hon. Member for Stourbridge would weaken protection during the transitional period because those people who remained on the old list, and who were transferred a few months later to the new list, would not have been subject to a ban on employment during the intervening period. That is a weakening, albeit modest, of the protection mechanism, and it is probably justified if a significant number of people would otherwise suffer the injustice of being wrongly included on the new list. It surprises me that the Department has not made an assessment. I do not expect the Minister to tell me specific percentages or numbers, but the Department should be able to say whether the number is significant and whether hundreds of people or merely the odd one or two will be affected.<br><br>
I thought at first that it was untidy to use the old list as a transitional mechanism, but I see now that it is not untidiness but a deliberate decision, which is justified if a significant number of people are not transferred from the old list to the new list. Only time will enable us to determine whether that is the best way to deal with the transitional arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay the Committee, but I want to make one point in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I now understand the purpose of the clause. The Department will continue to operate the consultancy service index while determination proceeds for those who are already on the list. Amendment No. 64 would introduce a mechanism covering people who will not be included on the consultancy service index after enactment of the Bill, and if a reference has not been determined it will be examined as though it were a reference to the new list.<br><br>
The starting point for my examination of the provisions was that everyone on the consultancy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
service index would be transferred to the new list. I understand what the Minister is saying: that cases under clause 3 cannot be determined in advance. One or two conclusions emerge from consideration of hypothetical cases. Either everyone on the consultancy service index will be included on the new list, or a significant proportion of those on the consultancy service index will not be included on the new list.<br><br>
In the former case, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that it might be simpler for inclusion to be provisional, with sanctions and safeguards in the Bill. In the latter case, a lesser test will apply. Presumably, the consultancy service index will eventually disappear and people on that list who are not transferred to the new list, although they were thought fit to be included on the old list, will not appear on any list. Which is it to be? Either we accept my hon. Friend's suggestion, or we accept the proposal in the Bill, with the result that some people on the consultancy service index will not appear on the new list.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire and his hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge understand one important issue. We have been invited to consider that the restrictions on employment in clause 7 should apply provisionally to those whose names are on the consultancy service index. The criteria that we use to include someone in the existing list are significantly less stringent than the conditions that will apply to inclusion in the new list. Inclusion in the new list will carry a restriction on employment, so it is reasonable to satisfy ourselves that the criteria in the Bill are met when determining whether someone's name should appear on the list. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentlemen have thought through the implications of their proposition.<br><br>
I emphasise again that our first priority is the protection of children, but we are changing to a different list with different consequences for the people on that list. It is perfectly appropriate to maintain the existing list, the arrangements that apply to it and the advice to employers about employing people who are on that list while we make these sensible transitional arrangements for the new list, which will carry a restriction on employment opportunities. We are all anxious to ensure that the Bill operates fairly, given its important consequences for individuals. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge said, we strongly believe that this strikes the right balance between the existing protection for children and the transitional move to the new list.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge carries implications about retrospectivity that I suspect many members of the Committee would find troubling. Some would say—perhaps unfairly—that that is inconsistent with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
the other points that he made in relation to clause 2 and the standards that will operate under that part of the Bill. This might be an example—I do not say that it is—of the hon. Gentleman wanting to have his cake and eat it. He cannot have it both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not intending to intervene in the debate, but I feel that I must, given the remarks that the Minister has just made. In a sense, the balance of whose rights we are protecting has shifted from one side to the other. One of the reasons for the change proposed in the Bill is that people on the existing index do not know that they are on it and have no right of appeal. It would be wrong to transfer all those people, wholesale, to the new index, which carries far more severe penalties. It would give them a right of appeal, but they would lose their employment rights in the meantime.<br><br>
The Bill will give extra protection to children, but it does not matter how many people will not pass the test to be transferred; if one person's civil rights will be taken away, we must take that seriously. We should not say that if 10 per cent. are affected, it does not matter. Even one person matters. If people remain on the index while the process is carried out, that will not weaken existing child protection and when the transfer has taken place of those who should be on the new list, child protection will be increased. I agree with the Government about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the Minister's criticism of my inconsistency in good heart. I tend to think that inconsistency suggests that a genuine discussion of the issue is taking place rather than slavish adherence to a prepared line.<br><br>
I came into Committee this morning with an open mind and some concerns that I hoped would be allayed. I accept the points that have been made, but no one has dealt with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire. Are we entirely happy about the fact that all those people included in the present list, who will not be included on the new statutory list, will, thereafter, go unrecorded in any way, shape or form? Admittedly, they have been included in the present list as a result of a lower test, but if I understand the administrative procedure that is proposed, the consultancy service index will be would up once all the people on it have been reviewed and, if what the Minister says turns out to be correct, there will be some people who are considered dangerous enough to be included on that list but who will not be included on the new statutory list, and who will get off scot free. Does that not give the hon. Member for Stourbridge cause for concern?<br><br>
The Minister and the hon. Lady may have very strong arguments, but I have merely sought to establish whether we have any idea of the numbers involved. The Minister's point becomes stronger, the greater the number of people likely to remain untransferred to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
statutory list. If that number is very small, the Minister's points have less force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must disagree with the hon. Gentleman, and agree with the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) that even if one person is wrongly put on the list it is as bad as 100 being put on it in terms of civil rights and liberties. The number is irrelevant; the process must be gone through and discussed in the transitional stage.<br><br>
On the more substantive problems that the hon. Gentleman raised, as a Back-Bench Member looking at the consultancy index, it seemed to me that it needed to be changed for two major reasons. The first is the greater protection of children, which is the main strand of my purpose here today; the second is the civil liberties aspect, which, sadly, was absent from the consultancy index. It has been my aim all along—as the unamended Bill demonstrates—to introduce proper checks and balances. It is reasonable to assume that there may well be names on the consultancy index that should not be there, so it is those which will be dropped off the new index. However, the names of the people who should not be working with children will be properly investigated during the transitional phase in the manner outlined, and transferred to the new list.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee last adjourned, I said that I wished to consider further the most appropriate way of responding to questions about the position of individual's originally included on Department of Health lists. Hon. Members were especially concerned about their being able to remain provisionally listed for intermediate periods unless some checks were imposed, including possibly representations to the tribunal about the length of time that they would be listed.<br><br>
Discussion identified difficulties in the solutions canvassed in some of the amendments. On one hand, time limits as such were unattractive to me and to my hon. Friend the Minister because they could too easily militate against giving children the effective protection that the Bill would establish. On the other, appeals against provisional listing could not usefully lie before the tribunal as long as there was no substantive decision against which to appeal. I hope that members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
of the Committee decide that the amendments answer their concerns satisfactorily.<br><br>
Clause 4 would be amended to provide that, in two sets of specified circumstances and where the tribunal gives leave, the tribunal rather than the Secretary of State will determine cases in the first instance. The two sets of circumstances would be either where a person has been provisionally listed for nine months, or six months after the final determination of any civil or criminal proceedings where the alleged misconduct is the subject of any such proceedings. It would be quite wrong for such proceedings to be prejudiced in any way by the Secretary of State's investigations: obviously they must take precedence. For example, it might be alleged that investigations by the Secretary of State had been carried out without a person having been cautioned, with the result that evidence crucial to a successful prosecution was prejudiced so had to be excluded from the trial. That might cause the prosecution to fail.<br><br>
It will be noticed, too, that the time limit on approaching the tribunal is, at six months, less than the nine months allowed in cases where there are no criminal or civil proceedings. That provision goes some way to recognise the time that would unavoidably elapse in such proceedings, without imposing an unreasonable time limit on the Secretary of State's consideration of the matter following conclusion of the proceedings, when he would become free to undertake his own review under clause 2.<br><br>
In the relevant cases, much of the ground would have been cleared by or in the course of the court proceedings. The Secretary of State should not need to spend as long on his investigative function under clause 2(4) and (5). However, for other referrals, time would be needed to enable the Secretary of State to investigate the issues. Furthermore, it would be necessary to allow for completion of, for example, employer's internal procedures. Those could include disciplinary procedures, where a referral was made following suspension under clause 2(2)(d). That is why nine, rather than six, months is needed for the Secretary of State to reach a conclusion in all cases except those that have been subject to other criminal or civil proceedings.<br><br>
I appreciate that some Committee members might still hanker to provide freer and more general access to the tribunal. For example, they may ask, if it may determine some cases at first instance, why not all? The reason that that would not be appropriate lies in the character of the tribunal. Its core function is that of an independent reviewing body, acting judicially. As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge pointed out, in the circumstances with which the Bill is concerned, the initial decision on listing is best taken administratively, though subject to the full judicial consideration on appeal that the Bill provides for. That is why the amendments would not automatically
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
involve the tribunal in first instance decisions, but would do so only if the tribunal gave leave.<br><br>
As will be noted, the power to prescribe the circumstances in which applications for leave may be made has been transferred, in effect, from clause 4 to clause 9(3). I envisage that the regulations should ensure that the exceptional course of having the tribunal, rather than the Secretary of State, decide cases in the first instance is not available if applicants have themselves been responsible for a delay, for example by failing to respond in a reasonable time to requests for information or for observations. The object is not to open the door to abuse of process, but to provide an alternative decision-making system where the Secretary of State has, for whatever reason, been unable to determine the case.<br><br>
The overall effect would be that, on one hand, the time limits would encourage the Secretary of State not to delay decisions unreasonably while, on the other, the possibility of approaching the tribunal directly would provide an alternative means to a decision in the event of excessive delay, without risking the wholesale substitution of a judicial or administrative process.<br><br>
The proposal is of course a compromise. The Committee will appreciate that my hon. Friend the Minister and I have had to swallow some of our reservations to construct what we hope will be a suitably responsive package. Although the package will avoid some of the perverse effects of time limits that concerned us, it potentially involves the tribunal in a way that I would not voluntarily have instigated.<br><br>
As it is, I point out that where the tribunal, exceptionally, determines cases in the first instance, there will be no appeal other than on a point of law to the High Court. Individuals listed provisionally will no doubt want to bear that in mind before applying directly to the tribunal. Similarly, the desirability of preserving the tribunal as a venue for appeals will move the Secretary of State to do everything possible to avoid delays. The Committee may agree that the various interests involved—which include the public interest of minimising overall costs of tribunal hearings—are thus balanced by the expected operation of the incentives in the package.<br><br>
I apologise for speaking at such length. I hope that the amendments will commend themselves to the Committee. I wanted the relevant changes to be made as far as possible on the face of the Bill, to provide the Committee with the reassurance that it sought.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Lady's attempt to address matters that were discussed in Committee last week. She pointed out some of the difficulties involved in dealing with the problems that were raised then.<br><br>
Last week, I argued for a time limit of six months. The hon. Lady, however, has proposed a nine-month
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
limit. Last week, the Minister said that most cases were determined within 16 weeks under the present system. I suspect that there is a great deal of bureaucratic caution in the proposal to make the time limit nine months instead of a shorter period.<br><br>
We wish to respond to the genuine issues that have been raised so, in a spirit of compromise, we shall accept the proposed time limit for a reference to the tribunal, except in cases in which criminal and civil proceedings are under way. I shall return to that caveat shortly.<br><br>
My concerns are twofold. The hon. Member for Stourbridge told us what the regulations should say about when leave is to be granted to appeal to a tribunal. Unfortunately, what she says about the wording of the regulations does not have the force of a revelation by the Minister of what they will say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I say that I strongly agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's clarification.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge said that she did not want leave to appeal to the tribunal to be granted when an individual's dilatory performance was the reason for the delay in the Secretary of State's determination. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that the regulations will make provision for leave to be granted in cases in which the reason for delay is not the individual's dilatory performance in supplying information requested by the Secretary of State. That will be a negative test. As long as the individual is not at fault, he or she will be granted leave to appeal, once the nine months have elapsed. That matter can be cleared up relatively easily.<br><br>
I have already alluded to my next anxiety. Should reference to determine be made to the tribunal, it will operate under the procedure specified in clause 4. That procedure was originally designed to deal with appeals, and has been modified by the current group of amendments to deal with applications to determine.<br><br>
The test that the tribunal is required to apply is different from that which the Secretary of State is required to apply under clause 2(6)(a). Under clause 2(6)(a), the Secretary of State is required to form the opinion.
<br><blockquote><p>"that the organisation reasonably considered the individual to be guilty of misconduct".</p></blockquote>
However, should the individual get a reference to the tribunal to determine his case, the tribunal must be satisfied—not merely form the opinion—that the individual was guilty of misconduct. That is a different and tougher test from that which the Secretary of State must apply.<br><br>
One of the anxieties about allowing such a right to appeal concerns not creating perverse incentives for an individual to go to appeal. However, the wording of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0074">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
clause 2(6)(a) creates a perverse incentive by allowing an individual to seek determination of his case by the tribunal in circumstances where the test that it would apply is tougher than the test that the Secretary of State would have had to apply. Has that been thought through? Can the Minister or the hon. Member for Stourbridge tell us how they intend to ensure that that does not create a perverse incentive to go to appeal at the earliest opportunity?<br><br>
I turn now to the provisions for deferring the right to appeal when civil or criminal proceedings are in hand. I understand that there is a problem when proceedings are under way. The hon. Member for Stourbridge clearly said that there was a danger that the Secretary of State's activity might, if continued, prejudice a trial. Obviously, none of us would want to create a situation in which that happened. However, I have some concerns about this proposal. I do not know whether there are any solutions; the problem may simply be irresolvable.<br><br>
Will the hon. Member for Stourbridge clarify the scope of the expression in the second line of amendment No. 88, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"is the subject of any civil or criminal proceedings"?</p></blockquote>
That seems a wide test. I hope it is intended that only civil or criminal proceedings, the outcome of which could throw into question whether the individual was rightfully dismissed, should be grounds for deferring beyond the nine-month period the time when the individual would be allowed to apply to a tribunal to determine the reference.<br><br>
Is the reference to termination of proceedings in subsection (5)(a) of amendment No. 88 a definite enough event? I am not an expert on police procedure, but I have a nasty suspicion that in cases which are not progressing well, where evidence needed for a successful prosecution is not being acquired, the inquiry simply becomes dormant. Is there a specific procedure that would be defined as the termination of those proceedings? If there is I am not aware of it. Is it sufficiently specific that it is appropriate to include it in this test?<br><br>
The other problem is that the standard of proof that is required for inclusion on the list is not the same as that required for a successful criminal prosecution. A person could be provisionally on the list for a very long period. Last week, my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire mentioned a police investigation that had been going on for over two years. Police investigations on some of the abuse cases in north Wales have been going for 10 years. A person who may have been provisionally included on the list for a long time could come to trial and be acquitted. Thereafter the Secretary of State could quite rightly, confirm him on the list. Public opinion might consider that a rather strange procedure. I am concerned that the good repute of this statute might be brought into question in such cases.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
If a person is suspended—usually on pay—while a criminal or civil proceeding is taking place, I do not see a great difficulty with what is proposed, because ultimately the suspension will have to be determined one way or the other, as a dismissal or by being rescinded. However, notwithstanding the fact that civil or criminal proceedings are taking place, if a person has been dismissed by the employing organisation, it seems inconsistent to say that the clock may not start ticking on his waiting time to a tribunal. As the overall thrust of the Bill is to use termination of employment as the trigger event, it is inconsistent to move away from that test if criminal proceedings are under way. That could itself give rise to problems.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge has immeasurably improved her Bill. I do not think that it would be better if any one of the amendments were defeated. However, there is still some way to go, especially in relation to the provisions surrounding cases where criminal or civil proceedings take place. I understand the difficulties if determination of inclusion on the list is taking place in parallel with criminal or civil proceedings. This is an issue to which members of the Committee, and certainly other hon. Members, may want to return on Report, to investigate whether we can go further down the route mapped out by the hon. Lady and tighten the important safeguards that she has provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few brief remarks in response to some of the hon. Gentleman's points. On behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge and, I hope, most members of the Committee I should like to say I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's general welcome for these amendments. My hon. Friend has done the Committee a significant service by listening to the concerns expressed by members of the Committee last week and tabling the amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised a number of concerns about the amendments, which I shall try to deal with in the order in which he presented them. The first was about perverse incentives. He felt that, by including the amendments in the Bill, we would somehow encourage those who might be included on the list to use this mechanism, allowing the tribunal to make the decision about including someone on the list, applying a stricter test than the Secretary of State. The person concerned would therefore have an interest in using the route proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge rather than the mechanism in clause 2.<br><br>
We would be worried if we were creating a perverse incentive, but I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that that is not the case. I do not think that there is any perverse incentive, direct or indirect, intended or unintended, in the amendments, but I think that there would be a risk of a perverse incentive if the tribunal could not take into account the person's dilatory behaviour. That is the point of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
the Member for Stourbridge, which makes it clear that the tribunal can refuse leave if the reason for the delay—and, therefore, the application to the tribunal and, as it were, the subverting of the normal process—was the result of the employee's actions. That would be the only set of circumstances in which the hon. Gentleman's concerns would be real. There would be a mechanism whereby, through delay on the person's own part, the person could engineer a situation in what the tribunal, rather than the Secretary of State, would decide on his inclusion on the list, applying a stricter test. But my hon. Friend has made it clear that we do not envisage that that will happen if the amendments are included in the Bill. A person whose behaviour and actions are the cause of the Secretary of State's delay in reaching a decision will not be able to use that in his or her favour and gain access to the appeal tribunal. I hope that I have convinced that hon. Gentleman that we will not let that happen, so there is no perverse incentive in the Bill.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was concerned about amendment No. 88, which sets out what happens in civil or criminal proceedings. He will understand the difference between a police inquiry and criminal proceedings, which take place when someone has been charged with a criminal offence. It is possible for the Secretary of State to make a final determination and include a person on the list before criminal proceedings have been initiated. That was necessary because as the hon. Gentleman said, a police investigation might last several years and we would not want a person to be caught on the horns of that dilemma—in limbo and with no right of appeal. That is precisely what persuaded my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge to table the amendments.<br><br>
The clause as amended will refer specifically to criminal proceedings, not criminal investigations, and criminal proceedings will apply only when a charge has been brought or information laid before a magistrate. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I can see nothing in amendments that will accentuate the problem that we are attempting to deal with—to incorporate a more effective, fairer system to ensure that a person is not unreasonably or for an unacceptable time included on the provisional list, with the serious consequences that that has for employment. Amendment No. 88 has been carefully drafted to refer to criminal proceedings.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree that the Secretary of State should not be put in a position whereby he might compromise, determine or express judgment or opinion about criminal proceedings—or even civil proceedings. That would put the Secretary of State in an unacceptable position. There should be consensus that it is right to specify this type of case in order to avoid any possibility of proceedings being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
compromised by the decision of the Secretary of State finally to include a person on the list. That makes perfect sense.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was also concerned about the tests applied by the Secretary of State as compared with those of the tribunal. I understood that the hon. Gentleman accepted the case last week when it was the subject of a specific amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. The hon. Gentleman accepted the logic that the Secretary of State would be acting in an administrative capacity, albeit within the constraints of the Bill. The Secretary of State would be deciding whether it was reasonable for the employer to have concluded that the employee was guilty of misconduct or a particular action. That is a reasonable test for the Secretary of State to determine.<br><br>
The key point about the appeal tribunal is that it has to judicially review all of the facts. That is the proper place for scrutinising the facts—within the setting of a properly constituted appeal tribunal, whose chairman is appointed by the Lord Chancellor. That is perfectly logical and provides the best forum for judicial review of the facts behind a particular action or behaviour that has given cause for concern. We would not expect the Secretary of State to discharge that function.<br><br>
I understood that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge accepted last week the broad basis of the provisions—that the decision would be made initially by the Secretary of State using the criteria in the Bill, and that proper judicial scrutiny of the facts should be put in the judicial context of the tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that, at the conclusion of proceedings last week, my amendment No. 73—which sought to stiffen the test applied by the Secretary of State to bring it into line with that of the tribunal—had been pressed to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman correcting me on that point. However, he accepted the basic point that there was an administrative difference between a decision taken by the Secretary of State and a decision taken by a judicial tribunal. There is a qualitative difference between those proceedings, which is properly and fairly reflected in the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment is very helpful. It is entirely consistent with the Bill's spirit, intent and purpose, which is to advance and significantly enhance the protection of children. It also achieves a balance between the protection of children and our citizens' civil liberties. The amendment is highly significant; it closes what the Committee accepts is a significant loophole, there was a risk of someone being indeterminately included on the provisional list without having any right to appeal. That is not acceptable.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge is to be congratulated on tabling the amendments, which I

hope that the Committee will accept in the spirit in which they were presented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jackie Ballard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a significant and welcome amendment, which is in keeping with the spirit of our discussion last week and the anxieties that were expressed about the position of an individual who may be left in limbo for a long time.

<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 has now been amended to provide for a role for the tribunal on a rather wider basis than was originally envisaged. In the original version, approaching the tribunal was possible in the case only of appeal against inclusion on the list when inclusion was other than provisional. As the clause is now amended, it will also be possible, with the leave of the tribunal, for individuals listed only provisionally to ask it to determine their cases when they have been so listed for more than nine months—or more than six months following the conclusion of civil or criminal proceedings concerning the misconduct of which the individual is alleged to have been guilty.<br><br>
Subsection (1) provides for appeals to the tribunal against inclusion on the list and, with the leave of the tribunal in such circumstances as may be prescribed, against decisions under clause 1(3) not to remove from the list. New subsection (1)(a), inserted by the Committee, applies to individuals who have been provisionally listed for more than nine months. It provides that, with the leave of the tribunal, they may have the issue of their inclusion determined by the tribunal rather than by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Subsection (2) has been amended consequentially to provide that the tribunal can deal with determinations as well as appeals from determinations made by the Secretary of State. The tribunal must now, therefore, either allow appeals or determine against inclusion on the list if it is not satisfied that the individual is guilty of misconduct as alleged and is unsuitable to work with children, or alternatively—if it is satisfied—either confirm the Secretary of State's decision or itself direct the individual's inclusion on the list. In whichever capacity the tribunal is acting, its involvement will remain entirely independent of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Subsection (3) provides that no finding of fact in a criminal court in the case of a relevant conviction may be challenged before the tribunal. That is because the tribunal is not an appropriate place for revisiting criminal trials, and it is desirable to avoid unnecessary delay and expense in the tribunal's proceedings.<br><br>
New subsection (4), inserted by the Committee, deals with access to the tribunal in cases of provisional listing where there are relevant outstanding civil or criminal proceedings. In that instance, the individuals concerned may, with the leave of the tribunal, ask the tribunal to determine their cases instead of the Secretary of State when more than six months have elapsed since the completion, as defined in new subsection (5), of the civil or criminal proceedings.<br><br>
The provisions establish an effective and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
independent tribunal that will extend across all cases for which it is appropriate. On that basis, I hope that Committee members are satisfied that clause 4 should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to acknowledge that the clause has been greatly improved by the amendments that have been adopted today. However, I am still concerned about the scope of civil or criminal proceedings that may be in hand, and which would defer the individual's right of appeal to a tribunal. During the previous debate, the Minister talked extensively about criminal proceedings, and I accept the points that he made.<br><br>
Civil proceedings are, of course, somewhat different. They may have been instigated not only by the individual who has been dismissed or referred but also—or alternatively—by the dismissing organisation. I did not receive a satisfactory answer during this morning's debate to the question that I raised about the scope of civil or criminal proceedings that would give rise to a deferral of the right of appeal. Would any civil or criminal proceedings connected with misconduct be covered, or would the outcome of the proceedings need to be material to the decision about whether the individual should have been dismissed—which is, after all, the original test?<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
So although the clause has been greatly improved—which I welcome—concern remains. I suspect that we will want to return to the matter on Report to see whether the drafting can be further tightened.</span></p>

ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR PROHIBITING OR RESTRICTING EMPLOYMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Stourbridge is not going to speak to the clause, I will make a short contribution. I have one question to raise, which may or may not have an easy answer. I hope that the hon. Lady can reassure me on the subject.<br><br>
The purpose of clause 5 is to amend the provision of section 218 of the Education Reform Act 1988 that brings into force what is known as List 99. Clause 5(2) inserts new subsection (6ZA) into that section of the 1988 Act.<br><br>
As I understand it, our purpose is to include in the grounds on which someone could effectively be prohibited from employment in educational institutions the ground that someone is on a list kept by the Secretary of State under clause 1. That is what paragraph (d) provides.<br><br>
I expected that the other paragraphs of new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
subsection (6ZA) would be the same as those as the 1988 Act for which they are to be substituted. However, as I understand it, medical grounds, grounds of misconduct and the grounds set out in paragraph (e)—
<br><blockquote><p>"as respects employment or further employment as teachers, educational grounds"—</p></blockquote>
are included in the existing subsection, but the grounds
<br><blockquote><p>"that the persons concerned are not fit and proper persons to be employed as teachers or in such work is as mentioned in subsection (5)(c) above"</p></blockquote>
mentioned in paragraph (c) are not. Section 218(5)(c) of the 1988 Act relates to employment as a teacher, but also to being employed by local education authorities or governing bodies of schools or such institutions
<br><blockquote><p>"in work otherwise than as teachers but which brings them regularly into contact with persons who have not attained the age of nineteen years"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, teachers but also others who have contact with young people.<br><br>
Why does the clause include paragraph (c), concerning "not fit and proper persons"? Given that that provision is not currently in the 1988 Act, I am not clear where it has come from, or what is its purpose. Presumably, the Secretary of State will decide on it, but by what mechanism? There may be a simple answer to that, but I do not yet have it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing the Committee's attention to a provision that adds to existing legislation. He was right to point out the changes that it makes. I hope that he will give me some latitude in my response, as I am not a Minister in the Department for Education and Employment. I shall, however, try my best to explain the purpose and intent behind the provision to which he referred.<br><br>
As I said, the clause specifies new grounds for prohibition or restriction of employment. They include circumstances in which
<br><blockquote><p>"the persons concerned are not fit and proper persons to be employed as teachers",</p></blockquote>
or are employed in work involving regular contact with children and young persons in the education service. Such provision is needed to allow the Department for Education and Employment to distinguish between people who are barred to protect children and people who are barred because of misconduct that is unrelated to children. The Department can bar people from employment for a variety of reasons, including misconduct. About a quarter of the people on List 99 are not barred for child protection reasons. They are deemed unsuitable to continue teaching because of dishonesty or because their conduct has fallen significantly short of the professional standards expected of members of the teaching profession.<br><br>
Current legislation does not distinguish between the various sorts of misconduct cases and barring occurs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
simply on the grounds of misconduct. The new power will enable that distinction to be made in future cases, so that people barred by the Department for Education and Employment to protect children will also be barred by the Department of Health from employment in child care positions.<br><br>
The test of barring on that new ground will be that a person's misconduct shows that he is not a fit and proper person to work with children in both of the capacities that I mentioned—that is, as a teacher and in other work involving regular contact with children and young people. Barring is intended for use only in cases in which it is necessary to protect children. For example, it will be necessary in cases of misconduct involving indecency or violence relating to children or when misconduct shows that the person in question could pose a risk to the safety or welfare of children. I am assured that such barring could not be used in other circumstances. For example, it could not be used to deal with incompetence or dishonesty.<br><br>
I hope that my remarks at least partly satisfy the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire—I can see from the look on his face that they do not entirely do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the trouble to read carefully what the Minister just said. I am grateful to him for setting it out in detail and I hope that the record of our proceedings will answer my question and will not lead to any further questions on the Floor of the House.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause will give people whose employment is barred or restricted by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment a similar right of appeal to that given by clause 4 to people so barred by the Secretary of State for Health. It is intended to ensure that anyone barred by the Department for Education and Employment has a right of appeal to the tribunal established under clause 9. That right will apply to everyone, regardless of the grounds on which they are barred.<br><br>
We also intend the arrangements for appeals against barring by the Department for Education and Employment essentially to be the same as arrangements set out in clause 4 for appeals against inclusion on the new Department of Health list. I am assured that the tribunal will be able to consider whether there are grounds for considering the barring
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
of appellants. If such grounds exist, it may consider whether they justify barring the individual concerned. If the tribunal is not satisfied on either account, it will be able to remove the bar on employment. The tribunal will also hear appeals against a decision by the Secretary of State not to remove a bar after a review.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will welcome the clause, which provides an important new safeguard to teachers and other staff who are subjected to barring by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to move the amendments, which stand in my name. Happily, they all relate to one issue.<br><br>
The purpose of amendment No. 45 is to insert a new subsection into clause 7 in addition to the existing provision that a child care organisation that proposes to offer an individual employment in a child care position should consult the list, Under the new subsection, a child care organisation that proposes to place an individual in a child care position should go through the same process.<br><br>
I shall be open with the Committee about this. I hope that the hon. Member for Stourbridge can assure me that the Bill already fulfils the purpose of the amendment and of those connected with it. It may, however, be helpful to clarify the purpose that underlies the amendments.<br><br>
The definition of employment in clause 12 is intended to be widely drawn. In the view of the Association of Recognised English Language Services, however, it does not extend sufficiently far to cover host families. If so, that begs the question of whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0079">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
the definition of employment in the Bill is susceptible to interpretation in such a way that it may not cover people who are in a position where they exercise a child care function. The Bill's purpose is to constrain not merely the employment of people in a child care position, but the contact that individuals have with children by virtue of being placed in such a position by an organisation. We use the word "employment" and then define it in clause 12 in a wide manner. The question that I am asking through the amendments is whether the definition of employment will suffice in, for example, the case of host families for young people—particularly those who visit this country for English language purposes. If it does not and it is a limiting factor, the Bill's intention would be best served by a broader provision that makes the position perfectly clear.<br><br>
Amendment No. 49 is related to the others, but has a substantive point of its own. It relates to the definition of employment in clause 12. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Stourbridge has considered this, but the amendment is in a sense an alternative to me pressing amendment No. 45. I would be happy for her to guide me on that. Amendments Nos. 45, 46 and 47 may be unnecessary because the Bill deals with the issue without any problem. It might none the less be desirable to put into the definition of employment the phrase.
<br><blockquote><p>"including the provision of accommodation for a child".</p></blockquote>
In that way, the contract for services that the phrase reflects would not be constrained in a way that excluded host families. Clearly, the phrase refers to the sort of service that host families provide.<br><br>
I hope that I have explained the issue adequately and I will not detain the Committee longer. I hope that the hon. Member for Stourbridge can give me some reassurance.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. On his first point, clause 7 requires child care organisations that propose to offer a person employment in a child care position to check the person's name against the Department of Health list and List 99. They may decide not to offer employment in such a position.<br><br>
On amendment No. 49, clause 12 states that employment means
<br><blockquote><p>"any employment, whether paid or unpaid and whether under a contract of service or apprenticeship, under a contract for services, or otherwise than under a contract; and… includes an office established by or by virtue of a prescribed enactment".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman raised a specific concern about language schools, as he did on Second Reading. He has also mentioned the matter to me on occasion.<br><br>
As drafted, the definition covers both paid and voluntary work. It also covers individuals who are employed by an organisation, as well as those who are self-employed and who contract with an organisation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
to provide their services. Furthermore, it covers those serving an apprenticeship and, by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise than under a contract"</p></blockquote>
those who do not have a contract. I am sorry if that sounds complicated. I considered the hon. Gentleman's amendments carefully. The latter term is meant to cover voluntary workers who may not have a contract with the organisation to which they supply their services. The term
<br><blockquote><p>"an office established by or by virtue of a prescribed enactment"</p></blockquote>
covers office holders and will include company directors.<br><br>
Amendment No. 49 would enhance the definition of employment by adding the words
<br><blockquote><p>"provision of accommodation for a child".</p></blockquote>
In my view, the amendment is unnecessary. The provision of accommodation for a child often forms part of the duties of the holder of a child care position. The amendment does not add to the Bill's definition of employment.<br><br>
I appreciate the issues that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire raised and I agree that the Bill should cover as many circumstances as possible; to protect children living away from home. I am advised that the Bill's definition of employment is wide enough to cover children placed with host families by language schools. As I understand it, the majority of placements with host families are made via the language schools, which retain a list of such families. If so, the host family is "employed" by the school within the meaning of the Bill. That means that a school can seek a check against the names of the family before placing children with them and may refer individuals for inclusion on the list.<br><br>
It should be noted that when the criminal records bureau is established, language schools will be able to register with it and have access to the one-stop shop. They will therefore be able to seek enhanced criminal record checks on host families with whom they place students. I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire.<br><br>
I am aware that Sir William Utting considered concerns about this group of children in his review of safeguards for children living away from home. In response to that review, the Government announced that they would work with a range of agencies to draw up a code of practice for language schools. That code of practice will of course need to ensure the safety and welfare of young people who are placed with host families.<br><br>
Sadly, the Bill cannot cover every circumstance in which children are living away from home, nor is it designed to do so. The primary responsibility for young people who come to this country to study must rest with their parents. They should satisfy themselves that the schools and colleges are reputable—perhaps we need to think about how to do that, but obviously it

is outside the realms of my Bill—and have put in place suitable welfare arrangements for students.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels that those points deal with his concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her confirmation that where an organisation contracts with someone to act as a host family for children, that is included in the Bill's definition of employment in a child care position, and that neither amendment No. 45 and the consequential amendments, nor the amendment relating to the provision of accommodation, are necessary.<br><br>
The hon. Lady said that the parents of children who are visiting this country, for example, have a responsibility to operate with reputable organisations. That is precisely the concern of the Association of Recognised English Language Services. The number of host families and children involved may be very large. Up to a quarter of a million children could be paced with 25,000—plus host families through schools in a year. Therefore, it is not a neglible factor, and I am sure that the hon. Lady did not think that it was. When that point arises on later amendments, we can consider including in the Bill provisions that will give such organisations a responsibility to undertake checks and not to employ those who are on such lists.<br><br>
I am happy with the assurances that the hon. Lady has given, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the duties of child care organisations, in relation to both Department of Health and Department of Education and Employment lists, which propose to employ someone in a child care position as defined in clause 12. It also deals with cases where the relevant person has been supplied by an employment agency or an agency supplying nurses.<br><br>
Subsection (1) provides that the organisation proposing to offer the post must check whether the person is included on either of the two departmental lists and, if so, must not offer employment. To support that, subsection (2) specifies the degree and frequency of the checking required when the person has been supplied by an agency and also the circumstances in which employment must be refused in such a case.<br><br>
To reinforce the control further, subsection (3) makes it clear that it will be irrelevant for the purpose of action under the clause if the person is already employed by a child care organisation. That will deal with a situation where, for example, a person moves within an organisation to a new post that would attract a check.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
Finally, to deal with the different structure of Department for Education and Employment List 99 arrangements, subsection (4) provides that, for the purpose of clause 4, the only relevant grounds for inclusion on List 99 are the fit and proper grounds of subsection (6ZA) (c) as inserted into section 218 of the Education Reform Act 1988 by clause 5(2) of the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 6, line 9, leave out from 'section;' to end of line 10.<br><br>
I shall not detain the Committee for more than a moment on this probing amendment. The clause specifies several circumstances and then includes, as new subsection (3B) (d), the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"a position of such other description as may be prescribed".</p></blockquote>
That seems to cast the net extraordinarily wide. Members of the Committee would be right to ask themselves what description of position there can be other than those already provided for in subsection (3B)—a child care position within the meaning of the Bill, a position of employment or further employment that may be prohibited under section 118 of the Education Reform Act 1988 and a position such that the holder's access to persons aged under 19 may be prohibited under subsection (6A) of that section.<br><br>
I do not like catch-all provisions. If the hon. Lady has something in mind, I should be grateful if she would let us know what it is, and explain why it cannot be in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can respond to the hon. Gentleman's concern. Clause 8, as he says, makes provision for people making application to the criminal records bureau in respect of the child care positions that the Bill covers, and enables teachers and others who work with children in education to make one-stop shop checks on criminal records, on List 99 and on the consultancy index. However—this, I think, answers the hon. Gentleman's question—the definition of "child care positions" in the Bill is not necessarily the same as the definition that will emerge for the purposes of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) (Amendment) orders in relation to working with children. That second definition will provide the authority for access, under the Police Act 1997, to the two higher grades of checks to the bureau in due course.<br><br>
The ultimate aim is for all organisations that are able to make the two higher grade checks under the Police Act 1997 when considering people for positions that involve working with children also to be able to make checks of List 99 and the consultancy index. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
definition of the term "positions working with children", and the wording of the new exceptions order are being considered by the interdepartmental working group on preventing unsuitable people from working with children. It was therefore decided to provide a power to prescribe, so that when the group's work has been completed, and the new exceptions order prepared, we can be sure that all those who should have access to one-stop shop checks will have it.<br><br>
I should add that we intend that organisations that will be able to make one-stop shop checks will include those that consider people for positions working with children that are exceptions to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. That is a somewhat technical explanation of why we thought it necessary to include these general words; essentially, it was to allow us to anticipate the work of the interministerial group. We did not want to shut down that option in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will be reassured that this is not a behind closed doors stitch-up, but a necessary provision to allow us to anticipate the work of the interministerial group and to give us the flexibility that we think we shall need in the work that we intend the group to carry forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be telling us that the subsection is included for the specific purpose of providing—when the interdepartmental working group has completed its task—for a prescription by the Secretary of State that will add to what is already in the clause. In other words, it provides for a one-off event, and is not intended to be open ended to allow the Secretary of State to make repeated additional prescriptions in future. If the Minister can reassure us on that, I shall accept what he said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is our intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 67 would bring two
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
new requirements into the new subsection of section 113 of the Police Act 1997. I am reaching the point at which I feel that we need a debate that is not too technical, and, fortunately, this is fairly straightforward. Again I am hoping for reassurances, not so much from the hon. Lady—these are not so much matters arising from the legislation itself—as from the Minister, because they relate more to the manner in which the legislation will be implemented.<br><br>
Two points essentially come to mind. First, we are dealing with employment: in particular, employment in salaried positions. Often the questions facing an employer are whether or not a person should be employed in a child care post and, after interview, whether a month's notice should be given by the potential employee before he takes up the post.<br><br>
Should the employer make someone an offer of employment, subject to the condition that there will be a reference to the list, he will be in a difficult position if that reference is not returned within the month. He must decide whether to employ—and have the embarrassment and difficulty that will ensue if someone takes up post and then has to leave—or resolve that employment cannot be taken up until the reference comes back, which may disrupt the organisation.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to the embarrassment and inconvenience of employing someone who then has to leave. Would not the employer be committing a criminal offence if he employed someone in those circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is right to correct me: that would become a criminal offence. I am working on the basis of current practice in schools. I have talked to one or two schools, and they suggest a two-month period for a turnaround on referrals to List 99. That is obviously anecdotal, and I cannot say categorically that that figure is an average, an exception or an unusual figure. However, if the turnaround were two months, that would be highly undesirable.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend points out, employing someone under such circumstances would become illegal under the Bill. The Corollary of that is that schools wishing to place people in employment would be disrupted if they sought to make an interrogation of the list and failed to get a reply within a suitable period.<br><br>
I lived with similar legislation in government, so I know that it is difficult to include in a Bill a provision requiring the Government to behave in a certain administrative way by a given time. However, in this case, the one-month criterion has merit, as it relates directly to employment by organisations that must be certain of getting a response within that period.<br><br>
Amendment No. 68 raises another matter. I have received representations, some of which state that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
volunteers wishing to work in child care positions should not baulk at the difficulty or cost—even if that is £10—involved in securing a suitable reference. That is perfectly reasonable.<br><br>
However, others have told me that people volunteering for child care positions should not be expected to incur costs to do so. Such costs may act as a substantial disincentive to those who are eminently well qualified to work with children. Such people give up their time and energy, and often incur considerable opportunity costs and expense in doing so. Those people will not object to being subjected to a check, but they should not have to pay a fee for it.<br><br>
Should the fee be remitted to volunteers by some administrative mechanism, or should we incorporate a mechanism within the Bill? Technically, that may be a difficult matter because endless arguments would arise. We would debate who a volunteer is, what a paid position is, what kind of organisation may make a statement and on what basis it may be challenged.<br><br>
I will not invite a long debate about whether that is the right way, technically, to proceed. However, we should find a way of remitting the fee to volunteers who might otherwise be deterred from undertaking valuable work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Cryer <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hornchurch)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak briefly because the point raised by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire also occurred to me.<br><br>
I do not particularly support the amendment. However, I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge whether there is a possibility of having charges graded according to the size and nature of the organisation, which may be voluntary, statutory or partly voluntary. Could the provision be rescinded? Charges, such as the £10 fee mentioned, could put some people off volunteering or applying for certain positions. I hope that the Bill will put off the kind of people we want to discourage from applying for certain positions, but we do not want to put off people who want to work with a voluntary organisation for all the right reasons with a fee that verges on the prohibitive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly value the work of volunteers. I am a former board member of Opportunities for Volunteering, a national body that gives out several million pounds a year to promote volunteering across the country. I have been closely involved in the work of volunteers and I fully appreciate how their work enriches the communities that they serve. They put in a lot of hard work which should be acknowledged. Whether there could be no fee is not something that I could have any power over as a Back Bencher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Lady noticed that clause 13, the transition provision, does not make any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
provision for a fee to be payable until the criminal records bureau is established? The Department of Health is presumably planning to do that work for nothing during the interim period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fact. I personally would press my hon. Friends to consider having a graded fee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I respond briefly to the amendment as it raises some important issues. Many of us who were Members of the previous Parliament will have a sense of deja vu about this debate on whether volunteers should be charged for certificates. We have been round this course before. We went round it extensively when the Conservatives were on the other side of the argument. They declined to accept the principle that volunteers should not be charged for their certificates.<br><br>
To some extent—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman could just bear with me for a second. There is not much more that I can say that we have not already been around before. The amendment does two things: it imposes a time limit on when a criminal records check will need to be completed and then prescribes that volunteers should not be charged for the certificate. The hon. Gentleman made a good job of speaking against his amendment when he said that there were a number of problems with it. I understand that this is essentially a probing amendment and he wants a debate about charging. I want to be able to say something about that. I hope that he will draw some comfort from my remarks.<br><br>
It is my understanding that the fees for certificates from the bureau will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup the costs. The provisional cost for the highest form of certificate—the enhanced certificate—is currently estimated at about £10. That will be required only by volunteers with substantial, largely unsupervised, access to children. Other forms of certificate will be charged at a lower rate. I think that that deals to some extent with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Cryer).<br><br>
It is difficult for Ministers at any stage of the cycle to make projections on future spending. I want to avoid doing that, for obvious reasons. All that I can say about charging is that, subject to the outcome of future spending rounds, there is already power under the Police Act 1997 for regulations to make different provision for different cases. That could be used to exempt individuals or groups from payment, if it was thought appropriate, in future. I know that what I have said does not constitute a direct response to the argument that the Bill should exempt people from charges, but to be fair I do not think that anyone is in a position to make such commitments now, particularly given the extensive arguments that we had about the Police Act 1997 in the previous Parliament. Ministers then declined to give similar assurances.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0083">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Department of Health estimated the likely cost to it of making the information available to applicants during the transitional period, before the criminal records bureau is established? I should like an idea of the cost to the Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless I misunderstand the hon. Gentleman, we are talking at cross purposes. The Department of Health will not be issuing criminal record certificates to anyone. We shall be operating our list under the new provisions and providing information to employers about whether a person's name is on it. That is our service to prospective employers. He is comparing chalk with cheese.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire made a point about time limits. He wants the Bill to require that a certificate will be produced within four weeks. The Government intend target times for the issue of certificates to be set. In the case of enhanced certificates, for which information will need to be obtained from police forces, it is intended to set target times in which police forces should respond to requests for information from the criminal records bureau. The targets have not yet been set but I understand that most certificates should be issued in a reasonable time. However, it would not be helpful for such a requirement to be set out in statute, because that would fail to take account of unforeseen delays caused by, for example, incorrectly completed application forms or disputes about identity. Those delays are likely to be out of the hands of the criminal records bureau. Presumably some penalty for failing to comply with the requirement wold be necessary—although the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire did not refer to that—but it would be unfair to levy that against the bureau, given what I have said.<br><br>
We have the best of intentions for the operation of the bureau. We want it to provide a fair service, quickly to people who need certificates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple question. Will the Minister at least assure the Committee that targets will require that a high percentage of requests for information from the list be met within a calendar month or less, so that employers will not be placed in the invidious circumstances that I explained?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be as specific as the hon. Gentleman wants. I hope that he understands why. We do not want the system to impede the reasonable expectations of employers. We want the bureau to operate effectively and efficiently. We have not yet set the targets to which the hon. Gentleman referred, so I cannot be as specific as he would like, other tan to say that we ecpect the certificates to be issued as swiftly as possible, for the reasons that he outlined.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
For those reasons, the amendment is not acceptable. I understand that the amendment is intended to tease
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
out from the Government a view about how the bureau will operate and clarification about charging. I hope that I have been able to reassure the hon. Gentleman at least somewhat about charging. The amendment has a certain amount of tongue in cheek about it, given the history of the charging issue and the background to the Police Act 1997.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Gentlemn was not a Member of the House then, but the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) was, and I notice that he left the Room before the amendment was discussed. I cannot say more than that on charging and I cannot be as specific as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire wishes on the speed with which we can respond to a request for a certificate. However, the amendment is not acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister tried to chide my hon. Friend and me when we were not here about the debates on the Police Act 1997, but if one tries to live in the past on a question like that, it cuts both ways. It begs the question of whether the Minister was in favour of the proposition that volunteers should not be charged under the Police Act and what has caused him to take a different view in office from the view that he took in opposition. Perhaps it would be simpler in future if, instead of going back to the past and trying to work those analogies, we debated the issue before us and what should be done in future.<br><br>
I move on from that untoward partisan remark to say that I am grateful to the Minister. I am not surprised by what he said, as, if I were in his position, I suspect that I would say the same. I hope that the Government will take both these issues seriously. I am sure that the Minister will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that people volunteer because they are committed to the cause? They take into account the cost of travelling, the cost of their time and the cost of somebody to look after the children. Does he agree that a small charge to check on a list that gives further checks to young children and other people is something that people will consider when they volunteer? If they feel so strongly about a cause, a charge of £5 or £10 will not deter them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I hope that I made it clear when I moved the amendment that I have had representations that cut both ways. Some people say that volunteers, as she suggests, treat it as part of volunteering: anybody who volunteers gives up time, energy and money, so it becomes part of the overall expectation about their responsibilities when volunteering. Equally, some have suggested that it could act as a constraint on precisely those who we want to volunteer and who do so for all the right reasons. We all know that there are people for whom £5 of £10 is an important factor in considering whether to give up their time to volunteer.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
I hope that the Government will think about this matter carefully and that we will all consider, with volunteer organisations and the bodies that represent volunteers, the way in which it works in practice. The Minister rightly pointed out that under the Police Act 1997 it is open to the Government to vary charges by category, so legislative provision exists to allow something of the kind to be done if it proves that, for certain categories of volunteers, the clause acts as a constraint.<br><br>
On that basis and in the expectation that Ministers will consider setting challenging targets for the administration of all the checks—not only the criminal records but at whatever level the list is to be referred to—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause makes the necessary amendment to part V of the Police Act 1997 to allow the criminal records bureau, which is to be set up to implement the provisions of part V, to act as a central access point for criminal record information and information from the consultancy service index and List 99. The clause gives access to the information on the list to those organisations covered by the Bill and other organisations that employ, in a paid or unpaid capacity, people to work with children.<br><br>
Subsection (1) amends section 113 of the Police Act 1997, which deals with criminal record certificates. The effect of these is that when an application is made for a criminal record certificate for an individual who is applying for a position in a child care organisation, and educational post as a teacher, a position which otherwise brings him into regular contact with persons under the age of 19 or a position of such other description as may be prescribed, the registered body countersigning the application may request that a check is made of List 99 and the consultancy service index.<br><br>
The criminal record certificate, which is sent to both the applicant and the registered body who countersigned the application, will state whether the applicant is included on either list and, if so, such details of his inclusion as may be prescribed by regulation, including, in the case of List 99, the grounds on which he is included.<br><br>
Subsection (2) makes similar provision in the case of enhanced criminal record certificates by amending section 115 of the Police Act 1997. The power to prescribe by order additional categories of positions eligible for access to List 99 and the consultancy service index means that relevant organisations that work with children can have access to the information.<br><br>
Including those provisions in the Bill means that planning for the criminal records bureau can, from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
outset, include provision to establish a one-stop shop for checks, and we hope that those checks can be introduced early in the bureau's operation.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause, which has been amended by the Committee, establishes the tribunal, which now has two purposes. The first is to decide appeals arising under clause 4 in relation to the Department of Health list, or regulations made under clause 6 in relation to Department for Education and Employment List 99. The second purpose, acting instead of the Secretary of State and having granted leave, is to determine cases provisionally on the Department of Health list where the listing has been for more than nine months or, in cases where there are relevant civil or criminal proceedings, six months after those proceedings are terminated in ways defined in clause 4(5).<br><br>
The clause achieves those purposes in three main ways. First, in subsections (2), (3) and (4) it confers a power to make regulations about the proceedings of the tribunal. Secondly, subsection (5) establishes offences triable only in magistrates courts and restricted to three specific areas of the regulation-making powers for the purpose of supporting the integrity of the tribunal's procedure. Thirdly, subsection (6) gives effect to the schedule to the Bill, which concerns the constitution and management of the tribunal.<br><br>

As to the detail, I hope that the Committee will accept that clause 9(3) puts beyond doubt how the regulation-making powers in subsection (2) will be exercised in practice. While those are largely technical matters, it is vital to get them right. By the same token, the Committee will understand that setting up the tribunal—particularly now that the Committee has extended its role—is bound to take the Secretary of State some time. It would not be practicable to commence a new listing system until the process is complete.</span></p>

POWER TO EXTEND PROTECTION OF ACT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Shipley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes it possible by an order under the affirmative resolution procedure to extend the protection of the Bill to adults suffering from mental impairment, as defined in clause 12(1). In that case, "mental impairment" is defined
<br><blockquote><p>"a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes a significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning".</p></blockquote>
The position of such adults is, in practice, similar to that of the children whom the Bill aims to protect. It therefore follows that in principle, they, too, should receive the same protection in due course. Although I cannot say now exactly when it will be possible for the Secretary of State to lay the necessary order, there can be no doubt that that is a highly desirable provision of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Lady's intentions in including this provision in the Bill. She spoke passionately on Second Reading about her
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
reasons for deciding to include it. In some respects, it sits slightly uncomfortably with the rest of the Bill, which focuses on the protection of children.<br><br>
I accept that adults who are severely mentally incapacitated have, in some respects, the characteristics of children, particularly in terms of their vulnerability to abuse by others. The mood throughout the House on Second Reading was that it would be desirable to extend the principles behind the Bill to ensure the protection of vulnerable adults, wherever possible. I am mindful, however, that the Government have their own proposals for protecting vulnerable individuals, young or old, within society. I wonder how the clause fits in with the Government's stated intentions to legislate later to deal with the vulnerability of older people.<br><br>
I would like to see the definition of mental impairment expanded to avoid an arbitrary division between different categories of vulnerable elderly people. My amendment No. 80 would deal with that issue, although I recognise that its approach is probably not comprehensive enough. The hon. Lady would probably agree that it would not be desirable if the Bill extended piecemeal to some groups of vulnerable elderly people but excluded others. The clause remains a well-intentioned attempt to provide protection to vulnerable elderly people as soon as possible.<br><br>
With those few caveats and my concerns about the need to extend the provisions to deal as universally as possible with vulnerable elderly people, I support the clause.</span></p>
