	<div class='page-header'><h1>Referendums Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Referendums Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I find myself in the unusual position—it may be unique in my parliamentary career—of sitting on the Front Bench. I am not troubled whether it is unique, but it is unusual for me to have the opportunity of introducing a Bill to a Committee. I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I occasionally seem less informed than the Minister with his phalanx of civil servants—in this case four—sitting behind him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to reiterate all the points made on Second Reading, but it is worth reminding the Committee of some of the most important issues in the Bill. First, whether we like it or not, referendums are now part of the political scene in the United Kingdom. The Neill committee clearly said that referendums, along with other electoral practices, were in need of regulation. I know that the Government agree because they set up the Neill committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said all along that I would be happy for the Government to take over the Bill if I had an absolute assurance that they would introduce similar provisions as per the Neill committee's recommendations, before any other referendum were called in this country. At least two referendums may be called in the near future—one on economic and monetary union and another on the voting system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is simple. It sets up an electoral commission called the referendums commission. Neill referred to an electoral commission because he was dealing with elections in the wider sense. My Bill deals specifically with a referendums commission, but I am not bothered about the name. If the Government want to introduce a Bill later, they can change the name of the commission, if they so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two main provisions. The first is to ensure that both sides in a referendum campaign are given the same amount of money from public funds, that should prevent what happened in the Welsh referendum, when one side had a great deal of money and the other side none. In a democracy, both sides must be heard. The second major provision is that all sides have the same access to the media—particularly the broadcast media, which is all that the Government can realistically legislate on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the Bill is simple and has support across the House. It enacts the Neill committee's recommendations. It is important not to establish commissions—Nolan or Neill—and then ignore what they say. The Bill should have the support of all democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I have already said that I would welcome a commitment from the Government to introduce these measures before another referendum is held, but the commitment must be made on the Floor of the House by the Secretary of State. Nudges and winks are insufficient. I have been a Member of Parliament for seven years—some members of the Committee have been Members for a great deal longer—and I have to say that I have a deep distrust of "not quite" commitments made by Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I am concerned that one of the amendments would take out one of the major provisions of the Bill, but we will come to that later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. I know that, whatever disagreements we may have during our consideration of the Bill, you will be impartial and fair. I have known you for some time, and you are always impartial—except when it comes to Stoke City football club. As you reminded me, they were defeated by Oldham last night, so I do not want to labour my point. However, I am sure that your partisanship in that respect will not be reflected in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it might be helpful if I set out the Government's position on the Bill. There is wide cross-party support for the basic principle underlying it and that is reflected in the all-party list of Members who have put their names to it. We hope that it will be an issue on which the house can move forward with a broad measure of agreement. Indeed, I hope that that is true of the Neill report as a whole. The hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) played it in aid in his speech. Certainly, the debate that we held last November suggests that there will be agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have much ground to cover and it does not make sense to proceed too hastily or in a piecemeal fashion. There is no obvious advantage—indeed, there is a real disadvantage—in picking out one or two recommendations on the conduct of referendums and advancing with them while others are left behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not regard the implementation of the Neill report as unimportant; we give it a high priority. We came into government with three manifesto commitments on this subject. The first, which was to ask the Committee on Standards in Public Life to consider the issue, has already been implemented. The Neill report fleshes out our two other commitments, namely, to require the disclosure of donations to political parties of more than £5,000 and to ban foreign funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Neill report was published, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said that we would publish a draft Bill that would cover these issues and all the important matters in the report before the summer recess. That is still our intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have that intention restated. When will the draft Bill become a proper Bill and have its Second Reading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to answer that question. Governments are never able to answer such questions. The hon. Gentleman, who supported the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
previous Government, knows that it is not possible for Ministers to say in advance of the Queen's Speech what will be in it. However, a draft Bill will be published before the summer, and it will give all interested parties, including Members of the House and members of the Committee, whose very presence here signifies their interest in the topic, the opportunity to express their views and to comment on how we might improve the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Bill will not be set in stone. We want there to be wide agreement across the House. We want the arrangements governing the way in which we conduct politics to last for a long time. That is a serious point and will form a strong part of my arguments. We have said that we will legislate in time for the new arrangements to be in place for the next general election. That remains our intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all accept the Neill committee's basic proposition that, in any referendum campaign, there must be a fair opportunity for each side of the argument to be heard. If we do not accept that proposition, there is little or no point in holding a referendum. It would be a somewhat unnecessary procedure. How we move from that principle into practice is less clear cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had 11 recommendations from the Neill committee on referendums and many others in the report overlap with them, including those on the electoral commission, the reporting of donations by political parties, the ban on foreign funding and the registration of campaign organisations at elections. There is also the possibility of going beyond Neill to provide for generic machinery for the conduct of referendums. Those are all serious issues that need serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Neill report clearly states that all the issues are interrelated and should be dealt with as such. Paragraph 2.34 emphasised that the committee's recommendations had
	<br><blockquote><p>"been conceived as part of an overall integrated scheme for the reform of the funding of political parties".</p></blockquote>
It went on to say that there was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a direct linkeage between all the recommendations, which should be viewed as a whole".</p></blockquote>
As a Government we wholeheartedly concur with the Neill committee's approach: this should be dealt with as a whole rather than a series of small parts. What is to be gained from setting up a referendums commission now when there is no immediate prospect of another referendum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may be an opportune moment for the Minister to tell the Committee something that is obviously vital to its further considerations. Can he give us the answer that the Prime Minister could not give me last Wednesday: in the light of what he has just said, will the Government undertake to hold no further referendums until they have at least implemented the Neill committee's recommendations on referendums?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is aware that a number of issues are involved here. I know that he is concerned about the referendum on whether to join the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
euro. The Government's position on that has been and remains that we will consult the British people when that is in the best interests of the British economy and Britain as a whole. I cannot say, and it would be wrong of me even to speculate, when that will happen. I know of no proposals for that to happen in the near future, but if all those things come together at some point I cannot say that it will not happen. I do not expect it to happen, but I cannot give an absolute guarantee. The hon. Gentleman will understand all the reasons why I cannot do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise that the argument that he was making is clearly null and void? The reason for having this piecemeal approach now is to forfend against the possibility of there being a referendum without rules, which he has just signally failed to rule out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that bridge appears in front of us we will have to discuss what arrangements will be used. The principle that I am putting forward is that, before the summer recess this year we will publish a draft Bill. It follows, in direct response to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), that if we have established in a draft Bill some principles on the conduct and supervision of referendums, even though there was not necessarily a body in place, in the unlikely event of a referendum those principles would have to be considered carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not quite as the hon. Gentleman described. There is no trickery involved. We are quite serious, as is the hon. Member for Blaby, in raising the issue. There are practical considerations, which any Government would have to take into account. Those are the considerations that I have just described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the nub of the issue. If there is no trickery involved, fine, I genuinely accept the Minister's good faith; it is not just a parliamentary courtesy. However, it is not necessarily the Minister who will take decisions on these matters. Therefore, as I have said, the Bill would be meaningless if the Secretary of State said to the House, "Before a further referendum is held in the United Kingdom, under the aegis of the United Kingdom Parliament, the provisions on referendums recommended by Neill will be put in force in legislation." The Secretary of State could make such a simple, personal statement this afternoon if he wished to do so. It would be absolutely fair because we would know that he had committed the Government to acting before another referendum was called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise only Labour Governments—I know what Conservative Governments did in the past—because they say one thing and not another—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will hon. Members please keep their interventions brief?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For reasons that I stated a few moments ago, I cannot, with rock solid certainty, predict whether there is likely to be a referendum before the new arrangements under Neill are put in place, and neither could my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary—or any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
other Minister, no matter how lofty—for the same reason. It is a nice try by the hon. Gentleman, but I shall not be tempted along his flower-strewn path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can, however, say with confidence that there is no immediate prospect of another referendum—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is probably my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary calling to answer the hon. Gentleman's question—and I do not say that to be misleading or to trick the House. It is simply the Government's stated position, which reflects our view of matters as they stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Nick Palmer 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxtowe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government's position is that it is desirable to regulate referendums in a fair manner? A draft proposal will be introduced as soon as possible; we shall also consider this Bill, which will inform our future deliberations, constructively. It is a practical matter how quickly we can get good referendum regulations through the House. We do not want a dangerous Referendums Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dread to think what a dangerous referendum might be. I concur entirely with what my hon. Friend said, as no doubt do the hon. Members for Blaby and for West Dorset. The Bill is helpful, although for reasons that I shall explain, we do not want it to proceed to the statute book. The Home Office officials and I have been co-operative—as the hon. Gentleman will concede—in drafting the Bill so that some of its proposals, apart from the referendums commission, are workable. We co-operated because we wanted consensus across the parties and with Members, and because the Bill helped us by clarifying our thinking. Officials had to consider questions a little earlier than they would otherwise have done. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe was right to say that the process was helpful to us in constructing the arrangements in a later Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the consensual nature of the Government's approach, is it not critical that, in a matter as important as this to our constitutional future, we proceed with the widest possible consensus, not only in the House but outside? Is not the fundamental reason for having a draft Bill that it allows the widest possible discussion outside the House before legislation is enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The worst possible conclusion that we could reach post-Neill would be a set of arrangements that were conceived by the public to be a political fix. Although I want to build consensus in the House of Commons and the political system, I stress that the most important consensus that we need is with the British electorate, because if they do not trust the arrangements and the means by which we reach them, the process will, to some extent, have been a waste of time. We are here because the British public do not entirely trust politics as conducted for the past 18 to 20 years. That is not necessarily a criticism of the Conservative party, although it is partly that. It is a criticism of the conduct of politics in this country over a long period, which has led to the sad point where public confidence in the political process is not as strong as all of us here would like. That is what we are trying to engage with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
We regard the draft Bill not as a device for delaying implementation of Neill's recommendations—indeed, far from it—but as the Government's opportunity to state what we believe to be the best way of introducing them. We are interested in the opinions of the wider public, experts and politicians and, if we have got something wrong, we are willing to consider modifying the arrangements. That is how we intend to tackle the issue. I say that as openly as I can because I think it important, from Parliament's as well as the Government's viewpoint, that we proceed in that way. that is our sincere intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wareing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his neighbourliness in giving way to me first. Did I hear right? Did my hon. Friend say that the Government are not in agreement with the Bill reaching the statute book? My point is that it is a private Member's Bill. I have experience of a Whip being organised against my private Member's Bill, although it was denied at the time. May I take it that if the Bill passes all its stages and reaches Third Reading, the Government will not do the same this time, and that if a draft Bill is all that comes forward between now and the next general election—there is an amendment proposing implementation by 2001—the Government will implement the Bill in the absence of any legislative proposals on the subject from themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are not obliged to implement every Bill that goes onto the statute book. Indeed, the money resolution attached to this Bill went through the House last night without any hinderance from Government—which is the convention. When a Bill has had Second Reading, and a demonstration of support from the House, we do not prevent the money resolution from going through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will explain the money resolution in a moment, and I hope that my hon. Friend, whom I have known for many years and hold in great affection, will understand what I am about to say in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall examples of other Back-Bench attempts to improve parliamentary systems? Failure to control national spending on elections is a great weakness. In the past 15 years, there have been at least eight private Member's Bills on that issue, two of which I introduced. All kinds of promises have been made in that period. However, no one ever opposes the potentially damaging and unfair failure to control spending on elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main attraction of the Bill is that it is a genuinely Back-Bench measure that would make efficient use of parliamentary time. Unfortunately, Back Benchers' time is seen as set-aside parliamentary time, and nothing ever comes of it. The Government's conceding that the Bill is a serious measure would be a great boost to all Back Benchers. We could then get the Bill through the parliamentary timetable in Back Bencher time and, with the help of hon. Members on both sides of the House, could achieve consensus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall cover that and my hon. Friend's point about electoral expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are determined to improve this country's democratic arrangements. I will not go through the arguments about devolution, as my hon. Friend—coming from Wales—knows such arguments only too well. An example of our seriousness about that subject is the electoral procedures working party that I chair. The Home Office services that working party, and Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members belong to it. There are two principles behind that working party. First, we want to build as much consensus as possible around the changes in electoral procedures mentioned by my hon. Friend. Secondly, we want to establish proposals that can be converted into legislation and that will be unlikely to provide argument about how important they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, attempts of that nature have been problematic because consensus-building has not preceded the discussion of ideas. We want to reverse that. I tell my hon. Friend in all seriousness that we do not intend to delay implementation of the work that we are doing. We intend to build the widest possible consensus prior to introducing a Bill. I hope that, before the end of this Parliament, we will introduce measures that will improve the conduct of elections in this country, which will include some of the Neill recommendations. We can achieve consensus on those important matters and legislate on them as part of the wider process of building confidence in this country's political systems. I am sure that we all agree that that urgent task merits everyone's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be consequences if we had no quibbles about the Bill progressing and being enacted. First, the Bill would be operating in a vacuum: the various recommendations and other issues in the Neill report would not be linked to the Bill in the way that we and the Neill committee think that they should be. A referendums commission operating in such a vacuum would not meet all the concerns of the Neill committee and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, given that there is unlikely to be a referendum before our Neill proposals are published, the body would have nothing to do. It would be superseded by an electoral commission shortly after it was established. We would have gone through the whole process for nothing. That does not seem sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to have contradicted himself. He says either that the system will operate in a vacuum or that it will never operate. It will not operate in a vacuum; it will not operate at all should there be no referendum before the Government make their own proposals. That is the nub of the matter. It will cost nothing to set up a committee that never meets. No civil servants will be required. The Bill will sit on the statute book until a referendum is called or until it is superseded by a Government Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those statements are not contradictory. They are both consequences. First, if there is no referendum—one is unlikely—it would have no work to
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
do. Secondly, considered in the context of the Neill package, it would operate in a vacuum. I have already explained that the other arrangements—what the Neill committee called a package—will not have been put in place. Consequences might be contradictory, but they nevertheless remain consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some difficulties with the Bill's provisions, some of which I pointed out on Second Reading on 19 March. We need a wider policy framework, and it is the Government's intention to provide it. We are working through the arrangements one by one, not to delay them but to ensure that we get them right. We need to give structure to the skeleton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was drafted with the best possible motives, but, unintentionally, it was emaciated. It could be compared with an early prototype; in that sense, it is helpful. However, it will need further work before it can go into production. It is not definitive. I urge the hon. Member for Blaby to exercise patience—I know him to be a patient man—and try to build something more complete that would cover the wider issues and that would stand the test of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised the Committee that a draft Bill would be made available before the recess. It will cover all the important issues raised by the Neill committee. The Bill will be available for comment during the summer. We believe that expert opinion and the comments of Members of Parliament and the public will assist us in producing that draft Bill, and it will be informed by our debates on the Referendums Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Bell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is clearly a non-partisan Bill. It is fair, and it has wide support among members of all parties—and, in my case, of none. The Bill is a prototype that the Committee will proceed to fiddle with it. Will the Minister then stop the prototype in its tracks and build his own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Me. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman uncharacteristically describes it in absolute terms. I see it as part of a process. I am not being disingenuous when I say that. The process was started by the Neill committee, and it is in that context that I have difficulty with the Bill. I am not worried about what it says, although, for reasons that I have already explained, I think that it would be somewhat unusual to set up a body that may never be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our deliberations are an important part of that process. We have the opportunity to build up a prototype. To answer the question directly, what we put in the draft Bill will be informed by how the Referendums Bill is constructed and what provisions it makes. The hon. Members for Blaby and for West Dorset will concede that we were more than happy to talk to them about how the Bill was put together. That was helpful, and I consider it to be part of a continuing process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Bill will answer the concerns that have been expressed. The Government feel strongly that we should deal with referendums in line with the recommendations of the Neill committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill, which I hope we shall soon debate, is an important insurance policy. It is not that one does not trust what the Minister says or,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
indeed, what the Government say. However, events dictate what can or cannot be done. The fear is that if the proposal for a draft Bill were to slip, as many others have slipped in the past two years, we will have lost the opportunity to put the Bill on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Bill is not required—if there are no referendums for another five or 10 years—and even if the Government proceed with their own Bill, going ahead with it will have cost nothing except the time of the Committee. I agree with the Minister that we want wider consultation and that we should involve voluntary organisations, community groups, political parties not represented here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Member that he is making an intervention. If he wishes to make a speech, he can do so in the normal way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will sum up briefly, Mr. Stevenson. I hope that the Minister will be able to answer the point. We feel the need for an insurance policy; why will the Government not accede to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to conclude, Mr. Stevenson, but I shall deal first with the assumption behind the hon. Gentleman's question that if the Bill was enacted, it would have no particular consequences. As I said, it would have no work to do; it would eventually be superseded by an electoral commission, and would therefore be unnecessary. However, that is not the same as saying that there will be no consequences. We should have to set up a referendums commission. Even though a referendum was not in prospect, the commission would be obliged to investigate how referendums might be conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no estimates to hand, but starting that process and setting up the commission would cost money. I do not know how much it would be; I do not say that it would be billions of pounds, but it would be something. I do not oppose the Bill in bad faith; rather, I welcome the debate, safe in the knowledge that we shall in the near future publish a draft Bill that will answer those concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dominic Grieve 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been very quiet hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the difficulty is that the referendums commission would have to be set up and start work at once, why not introduce an amendment that provided that the referendums commission would start automatically on the date on which the Government announced a referendum? That would prevent the commission from being set up unnecessarily and would also guarantee that if a further referendum were called before the new package were introduced, the referendums commission would immediately start operating and, in line with the provisions in the Bill, be able to advise on the ensuing referendum. So the insurance policy would work, without having to pay too high a premium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am besieged. I give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene in the exchange. I draw attention to clause 2(1), which does not refer to the Government introducing a referendum, but sets down that if any member of either House introduces a Bill providing for a referendum, the whole process must be set in motion. I do not know whether the Minister feels able to guarantee that no member of either House will wish to bring forward a referendum on any subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel an amendment from my hon. Friend coming on—which I am sure we will in due course debate at great length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the unlikely event of a referendum happening in the meantime, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) would agree that—even allowing for the difficulties he described—if we made provision in the Bill for the referendums commission not be activated unless a referendum were called, those would not be the best circumstances in which to set up such a commission. It would be reacting to events rather than taking a longer-term interest in the subject by developing a set of procedures and a more reflective role. Such circumstances are not the best in which to establish a new body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point and have to agree with him. Clearly, it must be desirable to achieve a long-term consensus. Equally, it must be undesirable to have a repeat of the Wales referendum, the handling of which was subsequently seriously criticised by the Neill committee; it suggested that the outcome might have been different if proper rules had been in place. While I accept that, on the basis of what the Minister said, the proposal is imperfect, it seems much better than the existing state of affairs, which has created a great deal of public disquiet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument would have more force if there were likely to be a referendum in the intervening period. I have repeatedly made it clear that we believe that that is not likely and that no referendum is in prospect. We reasonably expect, although we cannot guarantee—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> The hon. Member for Blaby laughs in a good-natured way, but it is a serious point. No Government can ever guarantee that, even for the reasons to which my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe referred, referendums will not take place; we do not envisage it but we cannot give an absolute guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a serious undertaking and I respect and appreciate the way in which the hon. Member for Blaby raised it. The debate that he has triggered will not be lost on the Government and will contribute to the process that I described to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) and which was launched by the recommendations of the Neill committee. That is a serious commitment. We are not trying to wriggle out of it, but our principal position, which we take from Neill itself, is that the connections between all parts of that package should be recognised properly in legislation.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
We intend to do justice to those recommendations and deal with the package, initially in a draft Bill and, after consultation, in a Bill that will be discussed on the Floor of the House. That is the best way to proceed. I do not want to dampen the debate; I shall listen to it with interest. Dealing with Neil as a package is the only way in which we can do justice to the issues it raises and also to the public concern that gave rise to Neill in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am a bit green about such proceedings, as the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) said, but it would be sensible for the Committee to consider the amendment to the sittings motion.

his wife, who is just about to produce a child. When we consider his health in the not-too-distant past, our congratulations should be sent speedily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are probing amendments, intended to ascertain the logic of the hon. Member for Blaby in choosing only four people as the number of members of the commission. Given that there is no definition in the Bill about the scope and type of referendums that can be included under the commission's remit, it could have a significant task to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Blaby does not want referendums to be used to conduct the affairs of parish, borough or county councils, but the Bill refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the introduction to parliament of any bill which provides the holding of a referendum".</p></blockquote>
Such Bills could cover many subjects. Our future relationship with the euro has already been mentioned, which is controversial both between parties and within them. One can envisage a host of other matters that individual Members, the Government or future Governments could introduce as possible work for the commission. Opinions are split within and between parties on many issues for which referendums might be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that I would agree with such a proposal, but if a Member were to introduce a Bill that, for example, necessitated a referendum on the abolition of a religious education or religious denomination schools, it could come within the scope of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wareing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not a fundamental weakness in discussions about referendums the fact that we have a tradition of representative government in this country, and representative government is at risk if we allow referendums to occur on all sort of matters? for example, some people might argue—I certainly would not—that a referendum should be held on whether to restore capital punishment. Representatives are there to lead as well as to represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order I understand the temptation to speculate about the matters that might be the subject of referendums, but I remind hon. Members that the amendments are specific. I hope that they will respect that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson. I shall come to the specific point about numbers. I agree with my hon. Friend's observation and shall return to it in detail later. The fact that the scope of referendums is not defined in the Bill could produce a much larger work load than that envisaged by the hon. Member for Blaby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not want to create an ineffective body that simply could not meet its work load. However, the number of members is inadequate. The Bill contains no provision for subsets within the commission so that it might consider regional matters. It contains no provision to deal with illness or the unavailability of the commission's members. There seems to be no place for deputies in the structure. For those reasons, substantial grounds exist to have more than four members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I suspect that all members of the Committee would support the view that any such commission should not be London-centred; it should be representative of the whole country, taking the four logical units of the country—Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England—would mean having four members, plus a chairman. However, hon. Members might think that inadequate to meet the need to have a truly balanced commission that could consider matters objectively, without party bias. From time to time, the commission might need to consider specific issues that, for example, affect only Wales—the Welsh referendum has been mentioned—or other groups. The commission's membership ought to reflect the United Kingdom as a whole, so we should consider a number that enables it to do so. I postulate eight as perhaps a suitable figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referendums might be on subjects that interest only a narrow part of the population, or on subjects that concern a large part of it, such as one with greater impact on women than men—I note that we have an all-male Committee today. A number as small as four is inadequate to get the right balance of regional, gender and ethnic identities in the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 would leave out of clause 1, in page 1, line 10—there is an error on the amendment paper, which reads "page 10"—the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"'a Justice of the high Court' and insert 'appointed by the Secretary of State'."</p></blockquote>
There are several reasons for the amendment. In clauses that we will deal with later, the spirit of the Bill shows a relationship between the Speaker, who is traditionally held in extremely high esteem, and a Secretary of State promoting a Bill. It seems that those people, given the constraints and benefits imposed by the Nolan report, ought to give us the scope to find suitable chairmen for the commission without their necessarily being High Court judges. Justices of the High Court have a busy schedule, and to impose another burden on them is to consider the matter from too narrow a point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given all the bodies involved, we should be able to find suitable people. A senior member of the Chairmen's Panel, or even the Speaker or a Deputy Speaker, should possibly be considered, or perhaps the chairmen should be from outside the House of Commons. Simply to probe the thought process of the hon. Member for Blaby, I would like to know why he considers a justice of the High Court as appropriate. My amendment would open the door a little and broaden opportunities to find a person acceptable to the whole House and the whole public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting for a moment that a justice of the High Court is not an appropriate person, but to narrow the appointment of a chairman to that category of people is too limiting. I made earlier comments about the need to have balance in the referendums commission. It is obvious that few justices of the High Court are women, though that number is increasing. It may be impossible to create the kind of balance necessary with a small number while constraining ourselves to one category of person at the head of the body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because both points are valid. I do not agree with all the arguments behind them, although I shall not explore those in detail. Eight people might be more appropriate than four. I am not sure that sickness is the right reason for that, but the smaller the Committee, the more quickly decisions are arrived at, as we in this Committee might discover ourselves. Some of his arguments are fair, and I have no objection to increasing the number to eight if that is the wish of the Committee; four is certainly a small number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am less happy about the hon. Gentleman's point about not having a judge. We decided on a judge because the natural vehicle—especially if the Bill is merely an insurance policy, as the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) and my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) suggested, and as a judge would have no work to do unless a referendum were called—would be Lord Neill himself. However, that was in the back of our minds, and is not necessarily essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong if the chairman were an active politician. An active politician would have a party affiliation, and could therefore not be an unbiased chairman. I accept that that is not always the case; perhaps the chairman could be an independent Member of Parliament, of whom there are a unique number. However, it would undermine the commission if it were chaired by an active politician, as I think the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) would accept. The accusation of political bias could always be made, even though it might not necessarily be fair. The commission might contain people from all parties and from none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his observations. One of the strengths of our parliamentary system that is poorly understood by the public at large is the way in which we conduct ourselves, with the Speaker and Chairs of the Speaker's Panel taking an independent, non-partisan role during deliberations. Does the hon. Gentleman think that there is strength in that, and that we should try to move the concept outside this place to encourage greater understanding of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had finished, but I shall respond, because the hon. Gentleman specifically referred to me. Indeed, the point is moving the concept outside this place. A judge is outside this place and is not, therefore, within the remit of partisan politics that it is essential that an electoral or referendums commission avoids.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the tenor of what both hon. Members are saying. It is essential that the chair of a referendums or electoral commission is seen to be operating independently of the parties and of the Government of the day. I worry that we are increasingly delegating such work to judges, because in that direction lies the American state of affairs, in which judges become increasingly responsible for what are essentially political decisions. The Speaker and the Speaker's Panel give us a precedent for snowing that we as politicians can run
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
bodies fairly. It would be rather embarrassing if we were to say that unfortunately we cannot trust ourselves, and must therefore find a judge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Referendums are crucial, and when a referendum is called, it is imperative that it be seen to be fair. Therefore, the process that backs referendums must also be seen to be unquestionably fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of opinion polls undertaken from time to time that place journalists, politicians and estate agents as the least trustworthy people, place the police near the top and at the very top place judges, just above doctors, as the most trustworthy. Given that context, the most obvious person to chair such a committee would be someone who is seen to be beyond doubt—someone of absolute trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that that aspect of the Bill remains intact; it is crucial, deserves support and will receive widespread support in the country. It says that we are prepared to give power to someone else, whereas the amendment says that politicians want to control the process. If the Bill is to mean anything, someone beyond doubt must be the chairman of the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept the point that judges are among the most trusted people in the country. However, I put it to the hon. Gentleman that that is partly because they are not normally expected to assume a partisan role. In the recent Pinochet hearing, I was disturbed that newspapers commented on the believed political views of each of the judges who were to hear the case. That will happen increasingly the more that we bring judges into the political process, and will reduce the trust that people rightly feel in judges. We should be careful about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Bell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had the odd experience of moving from a profession that is held in low esteem—that of journalist—to one that is held in even lower esteem. We are talking about the reputation of the political, and especially the electoral, process, and about improving it, if we can. While I entirely accept that a commission of eight members would be fine—no one would quarrel with that—the chairman should be outside this building. That is the reason for having a judge, and we stand by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill as drafted provides for the referendums commission to consist of up to five members, including the chairman. Amendment No. 1 would increase that number to nine, including the chairman. The Neill committee report on funding of political parties envisaged a membership of five for its proposed electoral commission—in line with the proposal of the hon. Member for Blaby in the Bill. The referendums commission will of course have much more limited functions than would the electoral commission, and so the more limited membership provided for in clause 1(2) appears more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are carefully considering the appropriate number of members for an electoral commission. As I suggested, much will depend on the range of functions that we give the new body. It would appear sensible to build some flexibility into the Bill in the number of commissioners to take account of a cyclical work load, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
In considering the composition of a referendums commission, the Nairne commission examined a number of options. It suggested that it could be modelled on the multi-member boundary commissions, or could consist of a single commissioner, similar to the Registrar of Political Parties or the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. It may be worth examining those two models.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nairne commission also pointed to possible disadvantages of a multi-member body. It suggested that it may not be easy to achieve a generally accepted balance in the membership. Furthermore, a corporate body may lack the decisive authority of a single commissioner. However, in relation to the hon. Member for Blaby's concerns about ill-health, if one person was responsible and fell ill, the whole process could come to a grinding halt. That may need to be weighed in the balance. The breadth of responsibility given to the referendums commission in the Bill suggests that a multi-member body, which would enable a broad range of skills and interests to be represented, may be more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance of opinion appears to be in favour of a multi-member commission. That is not to say that the commissioners will be full-time appointments. The Neill committee envisaged part-time membership of an electoral commission, but suggested that the chairman and perhaps one or more members might work full-time during the referendum or during an election campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like mildly to take issue with a contention made by the hon. Member for Blaby, although I may be wrong and I stand to be corrected. I understand that Lord Neill is not a High Court judge. The hon. Gentleman said that in the back of his mind he thought that Lord Neill might be the proper person to chair the commission, but his suggestion may not be appropriate. I seek not to make a major point, but merely to say that I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was right. Nolan was a High Court judge, which may be where the mistake crept in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it might be helpful to draw on experiences abroad; sometimes it is useful to see how other political systems deal with such problems. I had some research done, but we could find no exact equivalent body, or a referendums commission as such. We did, however, find three Commonwealth examples. A brief consideration of their composition may inform our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Australian electoral commission has three members, under Australia's Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. They are the chairperson, who must be a judge or a retired judge of the federal court of Australia, the electoral commissioner per se, who is the chief executive officer, and one other part-time non-judicial member. The electoral commissioner is supported by a deputy electoral commissioner, a first assistant commissioner responsible for finance, three assistant commissioners and seven electoral officers responsible for the management of activities within individual states and territories. Admittedly, the organisation is an electoral commission rather than a referendums commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Under New Zealand's Electoral Act 1993, its electoral commission has four members: the Minister of Justice, the chief judge of the Maori land court, one person appointed by the Governor-General who is also appointed chief executive of the commission and one person drawn from the judiciary, appointed by the president of the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Canada, the functions of an electoral commission are divided between two separate bodies. The chief electoral officer has responsibility for administering elections and is an officer of Parliament. The office has a single incumbent, and I am not aware of any prescriptions about the background of the holder of the office, which does not appear to be designated for a High Court judge or other such person. The commissioner of Canada elections is responsible for ensuring that the provisions of Canadian electoral law are enforced. Again, it would appear that the office has a single incumbent. Those examples may be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), is concerned not so much with size of the referendums commission as with its composition. Clause 1(3) requires the chairman of the referendums commission to be a High Court judge. I think that the sponsors have drawn on the precedent of the Parliamentary Boundary Commissions, which used a similar arrangement. Under the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, the deputy chairman of each of the four boundary commissions must also be High Court judges, or, in the case of the boundary commission for Scotland, a judge of the Court of Session. That reflects the differences in the legal systems in Scotland and England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions of a referendum commission would, however, be very different from those of a boundary commission, and I accept that. However, it is vital that the chairman and members of such a body, be it a referendums or electoral commission, are seen to be scrupulously independent and free of party political bias. If we are serious about addressing public concern, it is important that people involved in the process are not seen to be a part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having established that principle, we need to look at what the consequences for the composition of a referendums commission might be. The Neill committee concluded that the members of the electoral commission—the same is probably true of a referendums commission—should not, in the normal course of events, have been previously involved in any substantial way in party politics. Again, I see the logic of that. Unlike the United States federal election commission, the United Kingdom commission should consist, according to the Neill committee, of independent persons, not party representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Neill committee was clear that the electoral commission should not contain party nominees, it did not otherwise offer a view on the nature of the experience and skills required for such an appointment. That is a legitimate area for concern. What background and skills should someone carrying out such a function have?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The appointment of a High Court judge is one means of ensuring independence, but it is not the only method of ensuring that the commission is above party politics. There is a danger, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe alluded, that by making such a stipulation now, the field of possible candidates will become too narrow. Being overly prescriptive might rule out people with the necessary background, experience and skills. That is not to say we should leave the door open to some party hack, but to recognise that people with wide experience, who may have something to contribute to the process, might inadvertently be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will undoubtedly be people from a number of different walks of life who would be equally qualified to undertake this important role. Removing the qualification in clause 1(3) does not exclude the possibility of appointing a High Court judge but neither does it tie us to such a person. Instead, it recognises that there may be people with the necessary qualifications and experience to carry out that function competently. The Neill committee envisaged no such limitation. It would be as well, in these circumstances, to accept its lead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An equally important factor in establishing the independence of the referendums or electoral commission is the method of appointment. The Bill provides for the commissions to be appointed by the Secretary of State. That is no different from the way in which any non-departmental body appointment is made. The only special provision in the Bill is to require the Secretary of the State to obtain the agreement of the Speaker, prior to making an appointment. That is an interesting safeguard, and we shall certainly examine whether there is, in the arrangements that we intend to take forward, a role for the Speaker. There is an obvious connection there, and expertise that could be well used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other appropriate procedures that can be built into the appointment process. For example, a number of office holders, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, who are appointed by Her Majesty following an address presented by the House of Commons. It is certainly worth exploring that procedure further. The Government want to examine all those matters before coming to a final view on the size, and composition of, and method of appointment to, the proposed electoral commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been helpful in exploring some of the issues and the available options, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising it. I shall certainly give careful thought to the points that were raised as we develop our proposals for an electoral commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. It seems that there are two issues. I am fairly open minded on the first, which is the number of people to sit on the commission, but I think that the Minister's comments on that were probably correct and that, in view of the more restricted remit proposed by the Bill and by the Neil committee report, the smaller number is more appropriate. Whichever of the two is chosen, however, I shall not lose sleep about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is who should preside over the commission as chairman. That would seem to be an appropriate role for a High Court judge or a retired High
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Court judge. The compelling reason for that is because the actual issue that needs to be addressed is the framing of the words of the referendum. If ever there were an issue into which it would be sensible to have judicial input, it is that. Framing is a narrow but crucial matter. There has been criticism in the past—it is argued that the words may not have been framed correctly to reflect the true nature of the referendum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises that wording and framing are matters to be discussed under the next group of amendments. I should be grateful if he would take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Stevenson. I thought that we were dealing with amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes we are. I simply point out that the wording and the construction of those words are covered by the next group of amendments. I simply ask the hon. Gentleman to take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Mr. Stevenson. I think that there may have been a slight misunderstanding. I am concerned with why it is appropriate for a justice of the High Court to chair the commission. It seems that one of the commission's roles will be to consider a referendum's wording. If that is the case, the input that the chairman can provide is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the chairman cannot be a High Court judge, at least there should be a senior legal figure of some sort on the commission. I do not think that that would be dragging the judiciary into politics. As the Minister rightly said, judicial figures already fulfil similar roles in the Commonwealth and, critically, fulfil the same role on the Boundary Commission, which deals with a politically sensitive issue. It is precisely by having a High Court judge that we will ensure that any discussion on issues is kept within a narrow remit and that there is no tendency to try to widen it into a more politicised discussion. I am therefore in favour of having a High Court judge as chair—or, as a caveat, a retired High Court judge; I do not object to that. There are compelling reasons why a judicial or retired judicial figure should chair the commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in a quandary. I thought that we were deliberating the establishment of an administrative device. We have heard that there is broad political support for the principle of referendums, although there are one or two hon. Members who are exceptions in this Committee. But we have also heard that there are concerns about party-political bias within the administrative device, and that we therefore need to increase the number of people who sit on it. If that is part of the logic for increasing the number. I am bemused as to why we should, in the same breath, seek to change the chairman from a justice of the High Court to an appointee of the Secretary of State. That runs counter to logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear that that is not my point. As regards amendment No. 1, the number should be larger to ensure greater diversity of membership. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
specifically did not mention political balance when I moved the amendment. Amendment No. 2 is, again, about creating greater breadth of choice. I did not argue the point that my hon. Friend suggested. If I catch your eye again, Mr. Stevenson, I shall clarify the matter in response to some of the points that the hon. Member for Tatton rightly raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that attempt to clarify matters, but I am still left with the impression that the greater diversity was desirable out of a need for political balance. In partisan terms, however, I would think that the establishment of such a commission would not require that. There still exists in my mind a contradiction between the first amendment and the second. For that reason, we should perhaps make the issue the subject of the referendum of its own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston wish to speak? I was trying to rise slowly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to rise slowly, Mr. Stevenson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify a couple of the points that have been made. I hope that I did not suggest in my opening remarks that I was concerned about political balance—with a capital "P"—on the commission. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made an important point about the comparisons with the Pinochet argument. Certain bodies in this country are, if one cannot divorce them from the party-political machine, doomed to failure in terms of the outside world's perception of them. The courts and Speakers of this House certainly fall into that category. That is an important consideration, which makes our system work. It may not be the most perfect system, but it happens to be the one that we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tatton and I cross paths quite frequently in Cheshire and we have our differences and disagreements from time to time. However, I would never suggest that public opinion should categorise him in the way that it does regarding his previous or his current occupation. That is true of the vast majority of hon. Members in the House of Commons. It is unfortunate that some of our procedures have resulted in such public opinion over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is less than helpful, however, to argue that just because judges are held in higher regard than politicians at present, we should accept that we will be at the bottom of the pile for all time and, therefore, that we should not suggest politicians as potential chairmen of the commission. We could be talking about politicians with a small "p"—people who have divorced themselves from the party-political machine by virtue of, for example, being a Speaker of this House. I entirely agree that it would be inappropriate to have a 24-hour-a-day party hack as chairman. That would produce exactly the wrong view among the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby raised an important point, and I said that I would respond at an appropriate time in the debate. I am concerned that
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
some of the steps that are being taken could diminish the importance of the parliamentary democratic process. That is why I want the Committee to consider how we can keep Parliament as part of the process. Parliament will determine whether a bill progresses and is referred to the commission. Some form of link should be considered, and I noted my hon. Friend the Minister's observation that the Home Office is prepared to consider the point. I also noted his observations about examples from other countries such as Australia, which has a bigger commission, New Zealand, which has a diverse commission, and Canada, which has a single one. Perhaps we should explore those examples further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what I have said, I intend to seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment. However, I shall press amendment No. 2 to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested by the hon. Gentleman's remarks, and shall not oppose his desire to withdraw amendment No. 1. However, the nature of the debate suggested that Committee members believe that it is important that the matter hinges on a judge, and should not the hon. Gentleman therefore seek also to withdraw amendment No. 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am concerned that we are going round the block again. I am sure that hon. Members do not wish to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to delay the Committee, Mr. Stevenson, but I should like to respond to the point that was made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's point that the skills that a High Court judge develops in the course of his or her career are likely to be readily transferred in this context, and I can therefore see the sense in the proposal. Having said that, several other occupations may involve similar skills—the Clerks of the House, for example, who have to be seen to be politically independent. I can see the Clerk to your left, Mr. Stevenson, warming to the prospect as I speak. That example occurred to me as I sat here. People with ombudsman roles may also acquire similar types of skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more I think about it, the more I can see why my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe and my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston moved the amendment. I do not want to open up the field too widely, but merely to recognise that other occupations involve similar or complementary skills. The matter will arise again when we consider the electoral commission. Finally, I reiterate that the Neill committee was silent as to whether such a qualification should be attached to the job. That tends to support my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston in his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the previous speakers in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve on the Committee and to address these issues. As a possible declaration of interest, I can say that for many years I lived in Switzerland, where I observed the referendum process at close hand. I am more enthusiastic on the subject than some of my hon. Friends may be. I shall try to address it in a neutral and British way, as we would all wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer a concrete example to illustrate the point that I wish to make about these and later amendments. Let us suppose that in two or three years' time there is to be a referendum on membership of the euro. Let us suppose also that three prominent groups would be involved in the issue. One of the groups might be established by a Government led by the present Prime Minister, another by a Conservative Opposition led by the hon. Member for Blaby after a leadership election. The third might be a left-wing group with trade union support led, perhaps, by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 proposes that we eliminate clause 1(5)(a). At first sight, they may appear to suggest that the wording of the question should not be addressed by the commission. That is not what I am proposing through the amendment. Were the amendment carried, the subsection would read: "any matters which the Commission believe require to be regulated in order to ensure fair conduct."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the wording is transparently biased, the commission will find it necessary to intervene to overrule the Government. As the clause stands, it will require the commission to address the wording in any event. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
an example of when a non-partisan commission might have to take decisions that will inevitably be seen to have a partisan import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scenario that I suggested of a euro referendum can provide an example. A Government might suggest a wording such as, "Do you agree that Britain should end its current isolation and join the successful euro project?" The commission would automatically feel in such a case that it had to intervene because a Government had clearly failed to conduct themselves fairly and to provide a neutral question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Government might instead propose the question, "Do you agree that Britain should adopt the euro as its currency?", or alternatively, "Do you agree that Britain should adopt the euro as its currency and abolish the pound?" Those two alternative formulations would be identical essentially, and would be difficult to distinguish formally, but would have a different spin if I may use a modern term. One can imagine a pro-euro Government proposing the first formulation and an anti-euro Government, which nevertheless decide to consult the people, putting the second formulation.

What should be done in such a situation? Do we wish to delegate to a non-partisan commission the decision as to which formulation to use, although both can be argued to be fair? Do we wish instead to assert that, in such a situation, the Government should take the responsibility. Whatever wording is used, someone is going to have to carry the can. Judging from the experience of the Swiss and others, there will always be arguments over the wording. If the wording appears fair, it will pass under the terms of the amendment. But if there is dispute between two alternative formulations—both more or less fair—it is reasonable for the Government to take political responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is putting forward a serious and constructive argument. But has he noticed that, under clause 1(5), the commission is offering only advice, so the Government will inevitably take responsibility. We are not, after all, conferring on the commission the duty to decide the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. The only problem is that, in the real world, the Government of the day will feel almost compelled to follow the commission's advice if the commission is required to give it. If the independent referendums commission advised that the wording should be different and the Government insisted that they were going to stick to the previous wording, that would cause outrage and discredit the referendum. The opportunity should be reserved for when the commission feels that the wording is unfair, which is already covered by subsection (5)(b)
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (b) covers fairness and paragraph (a) requires the commission to take a view even when the question of fairness does not arise—perhaps on grounds of completeness, far-sightedness or other criteria, which are not the main reason for establishing the referendums commission. That is the basis of my argument for amendment No. 4.

Amendment No. 5 deals with frivolous use of the referendums commission. It is possible under the Bill for an hon. Member of either House to introduce a 10-minute Bill—or a back-of-the-Chair Bill—that requires a referendum. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) might like to introduce a referendum on cannabis, and I would be happy to introduce a referendum on some aspect of animal welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposing a referendum could become, as with 10-minute Bills, a standard device for Back Benchers to attract attention. Every time it happened, the machinery of the commission would grind into motion and it would invite individuals or bodies to apply to be a designated referendum campaign. It would certify one individual or body to be the designated referendum campaign and further activity would then proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see indications of assent from the Opposition, so I shall not press the point further. I suggest, however, that the amendment, by specifying Second Reading, would effectively narrow the scope to serious attempts at a referendum. It would still be possible for a Back Bencher to press for a Bill for a referendum: if it passed Second Reading, the machinery would be set in motion, which is entirely appropriate. We should avoid the risk of frivolous use, even though we know that all present Members of Parliament are serious people who would never waste time. However, it is possible that outside the House of Commons there are people who are not as serious as we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I am new to the Opposition Front Bench, but I have noticed that Front Benchers on both sides of the Committee sometimes get things wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Broxtowe, who made a great deal of sense, although I would not always say that about him. He is right; not every Member of the House of Commons shares his enthusiasm for referendums, but his words were wise, and I am happy to accept his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that Parliament's intentions, as expressed in debates, should be heard. There should be no bias in the wording of a referendum; we all know that whoever sets the question may, be able to determine the result. However, it is entirely acceptable if the commission has the right to determine whether a question is fair. What the hon. Gentleman said is reasonable and understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of Second Reading, we had not considered the frivolous nature of some Members of Parliament—God forfend that one might consider that any Member of Parliament has a frivolous nature. As the hon. Gentleman will know from previous debates in the Chamber, I would not want a referendum on the use of air guns, a subject close to the hon. Gentleman's heart. Other members of the Committee might wish to argue against the proposal, but I have nothing more to add.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that when the Minister responds he will resolve my remaining question. I originally favoured my hon. Friend's proposal to link the moment when the commission came into play with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
introduction of a Bill, rather than with its Second Reading. I believed that there was a danger that a Government might introduce legislation to enable them to hold a referendum, hold it rapidly thereafter, and thus reduce to the nugatory the Bill's effects. In the brief period between introducing such a Bill and a referendum being held weeks later, under the speculative hypothesis of an emergency procedure in Parliament, it would be almost impossible for the commission and the Government to do what was necessary to ensure fair and equal funding, access and so forth—matters that we will debate in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the original hope of some members of the Committee that the rules might come into play as soon as the subject was mooted in public. For example, at present there are before the public at least two subjects to which my hon. Friend referred: electoral reform and entry into European monetary union, both of which are the subject of popular debate Even as we speak, the Government are spending large amounts of taxpayers' money on one of those topics—not yet on the other, I am pleased to say—officially on a campaign to inform, but really, some of us believe, on a campaign to persuade. For those reasons we originally wanted to push the clocking-in effect of the commission back in time as far as possible—it was the Minister and his officials who pointed out that there was gross difficulty about clocking in the commission when no referendum was mooted—and we therefore opted for the first possible moment, namely, a Bill's introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Broxtowe made a good and convincing case for supposing that the Committee, in its enthusiasm for the earliest moment, missed the point about the frivolous use of referendums. Far be it from me to suggest that the Bill should create an elaborate machinery if, as an unintended by-product, that diminishes the force of that machinery each time that private Members make a silly attempt to gain publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reassurance from the Minister would help. Even if it had no legal force, it would have some political force. Will he assure us that the Government do not intend to act in such haste between the Second Reading of a referendum Bill and the holding of a referendum that the mechanics described in the Bill would become nugatory? If such a reassurance appeared in 	<i>Hansard,</i> it would give us some political levers to pull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not continue to make the false assumption that the Bill will necessarily fail simply because the Government want it to fail. It has had its Second Reading, and the Committee is meant to consider this Bill and not future Government proposals. Therefore, I hope that he will tell us what would happen if the Bill were enacted. If the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Broxtowe were accepted, can the Minister guarantee that he would not so accelerate the process that the commission's role would become nugatory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made clear, amendment No. 4 would remove from the referendums commission the specific duty provided in clause 1(5) to advise and to report on the question in any proposed referendum. That is right. It was not a role proposed by the Neill committee for the Electoral Commission, and even the Nairne commission
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
recognised that the wording of the question in any referendum was a matter for Parliament to decide. I support that view, as would most members of the House and possibly most members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, if, as the clause envisages, the commission is to be given a broad advisory role in relation to particular referendums, I do not see the case for singling out the wording of the question for special treatment. Therefore, the amendment, which my hon. Friend so typically thoughtfully moved, is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 5, I appreciate the case that my hon. Friend made for the proposed change. There is an argument for deferring any action by the referendums commission, in respect of designation of referendum campaign organisations, until one or other House of Parliament has supported, on Second Reading, the case for a particular referendum. However, once the Government take a decision to hold a referendum, the referendums commission—or under the Neill scheme, the Electoral Commission—may need to move swiftly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in 1975, there were only 71 days between the introduction of the Referendum Bill in the House of Commons and the date of the referendum. We recall that campaign with varying degrees of horror, amazement or delight, depending on one's point of view. The hon. Member for Blaby has heard me say this before, but at that time I was a young socialist in Huyton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A what?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A young socialist, as distinct from an old socialist. Hon. Members will appreciate that the Member of Parliament for Huyton at that time was of course the late Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister supporting the vote to stay in the common market which the previous Conservative Government had taken us into. The no campaign in Huyton—a pretty forlorn group, I might add—consisted of me as secretary of the Huyton young socialists, a Conservative couple who ran a dance school—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening with great interest to the Minister's autobiography, but I am waiting with equal patience for him to get back to the point he wants to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all to do with timing. The third great force in this wonderful political movement was a representative of the Communist party, a park keeper who was well known for wearing jack boots. To this day I can feel their imprint on my backside as a youngster in that park. I therefore have some experience of this, although I will not press that point any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Commission shall invite individuals or bodies"—</p></blockquote>
that will be as soon as possible after Second Reading if the amendment is carried. There is nothing to prevent it from doing so anyway if it is clear that a serious attempt is being made to have a referendum—for instance, that the Government have announced their intention to do so.
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
Any serious-minded commission would leap immediately to that task, knowing that once Second Reading had come, it would be bound to do so anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The point that I was making before I allowed myself to be so inappropriately diverted was that there were only 71 days between the introduction of the Referendum Bill in the House of Commons and the date of the referendum. The problem is that it would barely allow enough time to invite and consider applications for designation as a referendum campaign organisation, that is an administrative problem that could have political ramifications if it was not handled properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the starting gun was not fired until the Second Reading a number of valuable days would be lost. On balance, therefore, there may be some slight advantage in going with the date of introduction. The amendment highlights the need for this provision to be more carefully drafted and thought out. I do not mean that as a criticism of the hon. Member for Blaby; it is just that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe has made an interesting and important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we could look at making a distinction between Government-sponsored Bills which, as my hon. Friend says, are a serious statement of intention, and a referendum which might be introduced through one or other of the private Member's procedures and which could have a serious chance of becoming a referendum issue or could simply have been a Bill presented "behind the Chair". We would need to make that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be wrong to use the word "frivolous", but there are issues on which an individual Member may feel passionately. He may try to move it forward through some private Member's legislation for which there would be little, if any, support in the rest of the House. That would be an inappropriate starting signal too. Perhaps we should make the distinction between serious attempts—those which a Government intend to move to a referendum—and less serious attempts made through private Member's legislation. It is a good point, well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe and it is one that I would want to reflect on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the amendment has been proposed. I was delighted to hear that the hon. Member for Broxtowe has lived in Switzerland and is well used to the many referendums held there. I look forward to future debates with him. Although I support the amendments, I do not entirely agree with the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave for tabling them, or the distinction between a serious or frivolous subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who decides whether an issue is serious or frivolous? Many people would say that capital punishment is a serious subject. If it were put to a referendum, there would almost certainly be a call for capital punishment to be restored, which would be an impossible choice for Parliament and any British Government. We could not stay in the Council of Europe. We would be on the level of Ukraine, which is teetering on the brink of expulsion from the Council of Europe on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we equate that with other issues and useful reforms on which the Government are at odds with public opinion? I believe that the Government are being cruel
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
and unfair to seriously sick people by denying them one of the world's most ancient medicines. They have not only denied the medicine, but have put two people in jail. Many of us would regard that as an outrage, and a matter fit for a referendum. We shall have to grapple with these serious problems when we consider the issues that have been covered by referendums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is committed to the possibility of having a referendum every 10 years on the opening of public houses. There have been referendums in the past, and there will be referendums in the future which are specific to the separate nations of Great Britain. We may find that we are unable to distinguish in our own subjective judgment between frivolous and deeply serious issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members who have commented on my amendments. I apologise for inadvertently introducing the concept of frivolous legislation which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West said, is a subjective matter. The point that I was trying to make was that there may be some hon. Members who are so opposed to referendums that they set out deliberately to bring the process into disrepute by suggesting having one after another. We have to protect ourselves against that happening. Even if it did not happen immediately, it could happen in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a humble Back Bencher, I am not entirely enthusiastic about the distinction suggested by my hon. Friend the Minister between serious Government legislation and less serious private legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely using that as an illustration. I was not saying that that should be the only consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman continues, will he react to the suggestion that we could distinguish between a mandatory obligation and permission, enabling the commission to introduce the mechanics earlier, but making it mandatory only at Second Reading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reads my mind. I was thinking along those lines. There are two ways of addressing the issue. We are all aware that there are some proposals for referendums that have a serious chance of happening, and some that do not. We are trying to formulate a way that is neither offensive nor unrealistic. An option is to leave the proposal as it stands and take account of the fact that there is nothing in the Bill that prevents the commission from taking action earlier, if it wishes to do so. All the preliminary activities of identifying groups and selecting one for each possible outcome could be done without significant expenditure by the commission and without requiring fresh authority to do so, so that it would be ready to go after Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alternative provision, which would have to be in the form of an amendment perhaps introduced on Report, would be to change the wording "As soon as possible after Second Reading" to "As soon as the Commission may consider it appropriate". The commission could then
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
decide whether to take such action in respect of a particular referendum. I realise that I am straying on the fringes of the permissible, but could such a provision be considered as an alternative to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had the advantage of receiving advice from my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. There are at least grounds for doubt whether, in the absence of a further change, the amendment would not make it ultra vires for the commission to act early. That problem must be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. I bow to colleagues with greater legal experience than me, but if the Government attempted to rush through a referendum, as the hon. Member for West Dorset suggested, the referendum would be illegal because all the requirements laid down under later clauses could not be implemented in the time required. For example, apparently it would be illegal for the BBC and other broadcasting services—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening with great care to the hon. Gentleman's contribution to the debate, but he must not pre-judge what will happen under later clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your assistance, Mr. Stevenson. The best course of action is for me not to press amendment No. 5 to a Division, but to invite members of the Committee to consider introducing an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 has received consent from those members of the Committee who have spoken so far. The provision concerning
	<br><blockquote><p>"the wording of any question"</p></blockquote>
is an appropriate area that the commission might wish to consider in respect of a particular referendum if it felt that fair conduct was being prejudiced. Otherwise, as the Minister suggested, the wording is usually a matter for Parliament to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
International experience suggests that if the movers of a referendum put forward wording that was clearly unfair, they would seriously prejudice their chances of getting it through. Such matters backfire easily. I ask for permission to withdraw amendment No. 5. I should be grateful for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson, on how to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall inform the hon. Gentleman of the procedure if, and when, we come to amendment No. 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two points, the first being that of invitations being issued to campaigns only after Second Reading and the seriousness of any contacts that are made prior to that. That raises a difficulty. I can imagine that a commission, whether an electoral commission or a referendum commission, could have informal contact before the Bill is debated on Second Reading, but the invitation to any such preliminary discussions would inevitably be seen as being part of a process that could lead to the award of public funds to campaigns. There would need to be some statutory cover for that process or it would create the problem of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
something that began as informal becoming more formal and the prelude to the awarding of public funds. That would cause people difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would also be difficulty in making a commission, no matter how serious, well-established and well-led, decide whether a referendum proposal were frivolous or serious. I say that for two reasons. I have already got into hot water with my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe by having to reconcile what I said with what I intended to say, and were I to attempt to define frivolity and seriousness, I would surely get into further difficulties; clearly, such a definition is not an easy one. Secondly—this is a serious point that we should not disregard—to devolve such a power to a commission or individual would be to give away the sovereignty of Parliament itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to think about when it would be appropriate for the commission to swing into action. I take the Minister's point; one wants to avoid the imprint of the commission being seen as somehow sanctioning a referendum campaign and its role thereby being politicised. Might one approach it by saying that any referendum proposed by the Government is likely to be serious and that we could, as has been suggested, therefore keep the Second Reading trigger point while giving the commission discretion to cut in earlier on a Government-sponsored referendum Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting way of looking at things; the hon. gentleman demonstrates that we are engaged in a process, not all of which has been fully worked out. I want to give more thought to that before we make a final decision on how the electoral commission 18 to function. The debate has raised some interesting points that need careful consideration. We need to decide whether to accept the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, what arrangements are appropriate for Parliament and the commission and what is or is not a serious referendum. Those are difficult areas, as our debate has amply demonstrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has shown that the original drafting and my amendments are incomplete solutions to the problem. The proposal of the hon. Member for Beconsfield could provide a way forward. I feel unease about distinguishing in legislation between Government and other Bills, because Parliament is sovereign and the origin of a Bill should not be relevant. However, I am happy not to press amendment No. 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government accept that it is appropriate to look carefully at the role of referendums and to decide whether any new machinery is needed. The case for doing so is undoubtedly greater now, given the part that referendums play in our conduct of politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were elected with a commitment to make a number of constitutional reforms. We used referendums on the question of devolution in Scotland and
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Wales, on the establishment of the Greater London authority and on the acceptance of the Good Friday agreement to ensure that those major decisions were made with the support of the people affected. Our manifesto committed us to hold further referendums on the single currency, the introduction of regional government in England and changing the voting system for elections to the House of Commons. Indeed, when the latter was debated in the House recently, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary was elusive, expressing doubt about where he stood on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that agenda, clause 1, in which the hon. Member for Blaby sets out the arrangements that he would like to put in place, raises important issues that need to be addressed. The increasing use of referendums is a good reason to establish a new and settled machinery for their conduct. A strong case can be made for giving a separate and independent body the clear role of ensuring that a measure of distance exists between the Government and the regulations covering the conduct of referendums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the hon. Member for Blaby and the Government is whether to deal with Neill as a package, which implies setting up an electoral commission and implementing others of the Neill committee's recommendations, or whether to create a body dedicated only to referendums—a body that the hon. Gentleman accepts might disappear once the Neill recommendations are fully implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A forceful case has been made by the Nairne commission; I know that, in drafting the Bill, the hon. Member for Blaby gave great consideration to its work, particularly its report of November 1996, and the work of the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life on the funding of political parties. The two bodies differ little in their prescriptions. Neill recommends the creation of an electoral commission with a range of functions, including administering controls on political parties' income and expenditure, the review of electoral law and responsibility for ensuring the fair conduct of referendums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have stated our intention to legislate for the establishment of an electoral commission. We are giving careful consideration to the scope of its functions. We see no advantage in establishing a new public body with the remit set out in the Bill. That is not because the proposed functions of the body are themselves objectionable. I think that I have made it clear that that is not so. Some of the Bill's proposals are welcome, but its provisions are narrow, and limited in their effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Neill committee argued, an effective regime for the fair conduct of referendums, including the public funding of campaign bodies, should fit seamlessly into a broad and coherent scheme for regulating the funding of the political process generally. The Government do not wish to legislate for any part of any scheme in such a way as only to complicate the business of implementing the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, in the absence of an imminent referendum, the regulation of referendums seems no better a candidate for immediate legislation than any other part of the Neill committee's recommendations. For example, why are we not debating limits on published donations, or on campaign spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that this is a clause stand part debate, but I am worried that the Minister is moving to wider issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson. I merely wanted to say that, in the absence of another suitable body, the interim arrangements, as set out in the part of the Bill that relates to functions, create a body with a narrow purpose and that, as there is no immediate prospect of a referendum, a problem arises with the logic of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the detail of the clause, subsection (2) provides for a commission comprising a chairman and up to four other members appointed by the Secretary of State. In other words, it would be a standard non-departmental public body, examples of which can be found throughout Government Departments. The Neill committee recommended that the electoral commission should be an independent, impartial body selected by a non-partisan, impartial procedure. It stressed that it should be independent of Government. It would be difficult, given the political sensitivities of an electoral commission's functions or, for that matter, those of a referendums commission, to disagree. For most public bodies it may be appropriate to leave appointments in the hands of Ministers, but we may have to use a different approach in this case. Whether it is appropriate for Ministers to have that flexibility is open to question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement in subsection (4) for the agreement of the Speaker to any appointments to the committee might go some way to delivering a body that will be seen to be independent, but not enough of the way. Again, Neill suggested much greater distance between the body and the Government of the day than is implicit in the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doubt about the extent of the body's independence is not lessened by the fact that the Bill does not contain a provision relating to how the budget for the referendum commission would be set, or for it to be drawn on a departmental vote. I assume that the intention is that the referendum commission's budget should form part of the Home Office vote. However, Neill stated clearly that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
independence of an electoral commission would not be well served by the sort of arrangements implied by that, and that consideration should be given to setting up a body on the model of the National Audit Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am looking at the clause with great care, but I see no reference to the budget or the National Audit Office, and so on. I again make a plea to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that ruling, Mr. Stevenson, but the National Audit Office model might be suitable for the hon. Member for Blaby and the Committee to consider later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also usual for a Bill to establish such a body to make provision for the conditions of service and remuneration of the commissioners, the appointment and conditions of service of support staff, or provisions relating to its procedure. There is no provision for that in the hon. Gentleman's Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
