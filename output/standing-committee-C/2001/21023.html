	<p>[MR. FRANK COOK 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>The Future of Europe</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Colleagues, there was some disquiet after our last meeting. Right hon. and hon. Members and, indeed, noble Lords, had difficulty identifying participants during the debate and questions. Difficulties were encountered in identifying participants by constituency, there were a lot of Christian name and surname referrals and one or two others that were even more questionable. In order to adjust that, we insist, more firmly this time, that the protocols of the House should be followed. A list of the names of formal members of the Committee has been distributed. Several hon. Members are, of course, not mentioned on the list, so, to cater for that eventuality, extra copies of "Dod" have been put on both tables in the central aisle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has up to one and a half hours to hear statements from parliamentary and alternate representatives and to put questions to them, after which will follow a debate on the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put the question on the motion when the Committee has sat for two and a half hours, if the debate has not concluded beforehand. In addition to Committee members, any hon. Member or noble Lord may ask questions and participate in the debate. I know that many hon. Members will wish to participate and I hope that questions and contributions to the debate will be brief to allow as many hon. Members as possible to get in on the act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. In view of the fact that the Government have endorsed the principle of the European constitution, would it not have been appropriate for the Foreign Secretary at least to come to these sittings? The Government have committed themselves to the principle that we are about to discuss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that, with all the experience that the hon. Gentleman has gleaned in the years since he left Stoneyhurst, he will know that that is not a point of order. That point should have been raised in the Chamber. We now come to the statements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Gisela Stuart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Edgbaston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook, for calling the second meeting of the Committee, which allows the parliamentary representatives to report back to both Houses on the progress of the Convention. I shall limit my remarks to the areas that my colleagues cannot cover. We now have 10 working groups on the Convention. Since we last met, the first four have produced their recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to appreciate how the decision-making process works. Working groups meet—some of them sit on 10 to 15 occasions—and take evidence
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
from expert witnesses. The group that I chair, the working group on national Parliaments, takes evidence from other parliamentarians. Subsequently, a group submits its final report to the whole Convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the final report on the role of national Parliaments will be available in due course. That report was approved yesterday and it will go to the Convention on Monday. The plenary session of the Convention will debate that report for a whole day. At that stage, there would not be an attempt to arrive at a consensus that could be taken forward. The report will simply be taken into account for further discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Convention is, in a sense, a marathon. We have had a year, and now another nine months, so it would be wholly inappropriate for groups to take positions, which that they then feel that they must defend, before we even discuss issues such as institutional arrangements. That would defy the virtue of the Convention, which is a process by which all elements, including the Commission, European Parliament, national Governments and Parliaments, can learn from one another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four reports already on the table from the working groups on legal personality, subsidiarity, the charter and national Parliaments. As my colleagues are and have been members of some of the groups, they may want to speak about them during the question period. Apart from the working group on national Parliaments, I am also a member of the defence group. Therefore, if Committee members want to question us further on the particulars of the working groups, that will be the best time to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a change in the dynamics of the group. The first months, which provided a listening phase when papers were not on the table, saw general discussions. We are now moving into a period in which not only do we have working papers on the table and the emergence of diverging views, but Governments by and large are starting to take the Convention far more seriously. It was clear in the early days that although the British Government took it seriously and provided a strong representation, several others did not. More specifically, the German Government have now decided that their Foreign Minister will represent them, and I await with some interest what the French Government will do. After the recent elections, their Government representative refused to go, so there was almost an "opposition" Government representative. I would expect some changes on the French side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are continuing to meet at different levels, so interchange continues between national parliamentarians and the political families. The political families are playing an important role. The European People's party and the Socialist group have each produced a paper on the subject, and if Committee members want to know more, I will be happy to answer their questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say a few words on the final report of the working group on national Parliaments, which has been available to read today. There are several main issues. One is an anchoring of European Union decision making in national Parliaments. The report
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
endorsed the recommendations of the subsidiarity group, which suggested that any legislative proposals should be submitted to national Parliaments for a view on whether they breach subsidiarity or proportionality. If a substantial number of Parliaments believe that they do, the Commission will have to reconsider the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another recommendation is for much closer, more systematic and structured co-operation between national Parliaments and the European Parliament. We recommend that the European Parliament should routinely invite national parliamentarians to some of their committees. We will also propose a European week, so that when the Commission puts its legislative proposals to the European Parliament, it does to national Parliaments too. Should they choose, national Parliaments across Europe can then debate, during a window of time, the European Union and where its legislative programme is going during the next 12 months. That is significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also examined the potential for reforming the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees and discussed the idea of a congress. There was some resistance in the working group to considering a congress, not least because we felt that if our job was to simplify the European Union, the creation of a new institution would not be a logical way forward. However, it was accepted that there was a need for a meeting forum for national Parliaments and where MEPs and national parliamentarians could meet. We have not progressed much further on that, but the idea will be discussed during the next month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the record, I notice that in this week's 	<i>The House Magazine</i> Lord Brabazon of Tara said that he was unhappy about some of the methods of the scrutiny reserve being exercised. I hope that he will be pleased by some of the report's recommendations, which include no longer taking a preliminary position, but respecting the six-week period and making the process more transparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also support all the proposals to reform the Council so that its decisions are in the open and people know what Ministers have done on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government are asserting themselves more, we still have some way to go before parliamentarians find a collective voice. Members of the Convention still do not see national parliamentarians standing up and saying, "I speak for Parliament." I hope that we in the various political families will be able to make some progress on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the one institution that appears to feel the most threatened at the moment is the European Parliament. It arrived at the Convention with a position, which national parliamentarians perceived to be a threat: we were a diverse group and there was that block with a position. Of course, things have moved on, and it is difficult to change that position. Some of the tensions relate to the fear of being undermined. The national parliamentarians group did not want to set up a competition between the European Parliament and national Parliaments. We wanted the role of parliamentarians to be recognised, and for some to operate on a national level, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
others on a European level. However, we will not succeed in earning the confidence of the public or the member states in the decision-making process in the European Union unless we start to work together much more constructively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Convention has reached a critical stage. On Monday, as we heard, the President, Valéry Giscard D'Estaing, will unveil a draft constitution for Europe that follows the conclusions of several working groups, and the interim conclusions from other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say at the outset that I am disturbed by the direction of events, as they overturn several of what I believed were established British cross-party views. It is now certain that the European Union will have a single legal personality, as part of which the intergovernmental pillars will be collapsed into a single institutional structure. The working group further recommends that the European Union, with its new-found legal clothing, assumes responsibility for negotiating agreements in the intergovernmental areas of justice, home affairs, foreign policy and security, and that the current requirement that agreements in those areas should be ratified by the Parliaments of member states should go. That is alluded to in the documents before the Committee. If followed, that would certainly be a diminution in the powers of this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been agreed in principle that the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union should become legally binding, and that the European Union should, as a body, accede to the separate European convention on human rights. What is surprising is that the Government recently resisted all those developments. They resisted a written constitution, strongly supported the intergovernmental pillars, and opposed the European Union's having a legal personality. They also promised us that the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union would not be made legally binding. It was only on that basis that we signed up to it when the treaty was last changed. We all remember the former Minister for Europe, the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz), saying that the charter was no more legally significant than the 	<i>Beano</i>. I am sure that that statement was made in good faith, but it has not long survived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance for this House is that these proposals will take decisions further into a single legal and institutional structure—more remote and less democratic. We are offered the compensation that national Parliaments will have an early opportunity to comment on matters of subsidiarity and I should like to congratulate the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) on advancing that proposition in her own working group. It opens up a new possibility that national Parliaments will be allowed to have an early input into the legislative process. I share the disquiet of the European Scrutiny Committee in its recent press release when it said that that was an inadequate response to the democratic deficit. It does not begin to offset the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
moves in the opposite direction, to which I have alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a member of the working group on competences—who does what and at what level powers are exercised—which is shortly to report. For my part, I want it established that all powers reside at member state level, unless they are exercised at European Union level, in which case, whether exclusive or shared, they must be precisely and clearly spelled out. Provision should also be made for the return of competences of powers to member states. Above all, the certainty and clarity in treaty law must not be undermined, as it has in the past, by the use of other general treaty articles, such as single market powers, or by the activism of the Court, which can override the apparent clarity of negotiated treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I am also a member of a working party on justice, freedom and security. I can speak only a word or two on the subject because the working party has only just started meeting and has conducted just two evidence sessions. I understand that persistent calls have been made for the European Union to do more in the sensitive area of crime, policing and justice. If those matters are removed to a higher tier of government in the European Union, the democratic deficit and the sense of alienation and remoteness, which led to the setting up of the Convention, might well get substantially worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already heard two clear accounts of the broad issues underlying the Convention, so I do not propose to analyse it further, especially as I am an alternate within the Convention. Rather, I shall speak about the working parties in which I am engaged: alternates fully participate in them. I attend all meetings of the Convention and have occasionally contributed to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working party on complementary competences has made substantial progress. We have worked on words that created different degrees of confusion in some places and irritation in others. Words such as "ever closer union", for example, made it appear as though the European treaty—or constitution, or whatever it is going to be—was in a state of almost permanent Trotskyist revolution: as soon as one form of words was proposed, it would be changed into something else. A consensus seems to have emerged that such words should be omitted from a future treaty. Once we have an "agreement", it should remain an agreement for substantially longer than at present. Successively, we have had the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties: no sooner is the ink dry in Nice than we have to start all over again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the major principles emerging from the working group on complementary competences. First, as Mr. Heathcoat-Amory mentioned, there is the principle of conferred powers. There seems to be no disagreement on the need for a clear statement that the European Union has no powers of its own, but only powers that are transferred to it by the decision of
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
sovereign states, and that any powers not thus explicitly transferred to it are powers that remain with the member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the clear commitment to the principle of subsidiarity, which was referred to earlier. Therefore, in any future arrangement the Union will need to demonstrate that the objective of any proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third of the principles that are important in this area is that of proportionality. In that context, the view has been widely expressed—I believe that it is a majority view, and I will be pressing it on Commissioner Christophersen when he gives the final report of our working group—that the Union shall exercise its powers in such a way as to encroach as little as possible on the member states, consistent with achieving the stated objective of the action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth principle is that of diversity—the requirement of the Union to respect differences in national identity and culture in its decision making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results of the work of the Christophersen commission will be reported orally to the Convention next Monday, and I believe that I shall be substantially satisfied with the final text, on which we shall deliberate next Wednesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group on simplification has a much more difficult task—in many respects as difficult as that of the working group on competences. There will be a major division of responsibilities between Lord Maclennan and me. The major area on which I am working in that group, although my work, of course, relates to all areas, is the proposals for budgetary simplification, and those are inextricably linked with the common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, for example, a fundamental demand from the European Parliament to abolish the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure. In my view, that is impossible. I have made it clear that it would be impossible for any of the national Parliaments to accept that, unless absolute commitments were made in relation to budgetary discipline, agricultural reform and the continuation of inter-institutional agreements leading to financial perspectives that limit the impact of agriculture within the overall budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Ms Stuart referred to the question of the dynamics of the Convention. I agree with her analysis that, at the beginning, its dynamics reflected the European Parliament, because of its culture, its work and the staff and infrastructure. The staff had been working on that agenda for months, if not years. Therefore, at the beginning, there seemed to be a drive to get the European Parliament agenda adopted as the key of the Convention. That never happened. It was resisted in disparate ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recently, not only the national Parliaments and Governments of the 15 member states, but the parliamentarians and Government representatives of the accession countries have been more critical of views confidently espoused by the European Parliament, and its view seems much less likely to be

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
accepted than originally anticipated. The beneficiaries of that change of dynamics have been national Parliaments and their Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan of Rogart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three speakers who have preceded me have covered the ground in a broad way, so it would be sensible for me to say little at this stage, but rather to answer questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I feel it incumbent on me to put a slightly different gloss on some of the matters to which the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) referred. He mentioned, for example, that the President of the Convention is expected to produce a draft constitution for Europe on Monday. However, I understand that what we receive will be very much less than a draft constitution; it will be a skeleton outline at most, which will do little to answer any of the questions that have to be answered when it is given flesh. It would be wrong to build up at this stage expectations of that document that will be dashed next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In talking about the work of the group to which I belonged on the single legal personality, the right hon. Gentleman went a little beyond the necessary implications of that report. It was unanimously agreed that the Union had legal personality and that it was therefore not a profound step openly to attribute such a personality to the Union in the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of recommendations were made that were thought sensible, but which were referred on to the working group that was established to consider issues relating to the conduct of the Union's external policy, such as whether an implication flows from the attribution of a legal personality as to the representation of the Union abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I express a slight note of concern at this stage with regard to the whole process? Understandably, because the Convention is structured as it has been, with the national member parliamentarians playing a major part, there has been a considerable focus on the role of national Parliaments, the relationship of the Union to the Governments of the member states in the working group on subsidiarity, and the concerns that are properly those of national parliamentarians about how to hold their own member Governments to account. Noticeably less attention has been paid, although it will have to be paid, to the increased democratisation of the European Union's own institutions. However, attention will have to be paid to that, as it cannot be thought that the concerns about democracy in the construction of the Union will be answered merely by changes in the relationship between the Union's institutions and the national Parliaments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second concern is not only that little attention has been paid as yet to the Union's democracy, but that significant consideration has not been given to the issue of effectiveness in the conduct of those policy areas that are attributed to the Union, which have been the Union's sphere of responsibility for almost half a century in some cases, and where there is a need to reconnect the citizens of Europe with the institutions that are delivering in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I hope that the praesidium and the President and Vice-Presidents are managing the Convention so as not to prevent a full discussion of those issues in good time. It would be unacceptable if the Convention were bounced towards the end of its processes with structures that raise many questions and that are highly debatable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have concerns about the work that is being done in the working groups, which provides valuable building blocks. I particularly commend the work that has just come out, which I have read, on the incorporation of the charter. It is a weighty document, in which the British input has been considerable through the membership of the group of Baroness Scotland of Asthal. She has been playing a notable part in ensuring that what might be described as British concerns are properly taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it prudent to remind those who were here on the previous occasion, and to inform those who were not, that we have until 6 pm for questions to the representatives. That does not mean that we have to take until 6 pm, but we can go no later. Everyone will understand that. I remind hon. Members that their questions should be brief and asked one at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maples 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells comment on this? There is already a subsidiarity provision in the treaty, but we all know what the problem has been. Essentially it is open to interpretation by the European Court of Justice, which tends to do so in a way that enhances and expands the Union's capabilities and competences. If we really mean to achieve subsidiarity, we must write it the other way round and say that any interpretation of the provision by the European Court of Justice must be made in accordance with the following proviso: it should be interpreted in favour of the capability remaining with the nation state rather than the EU, unless it is absolutely clear that it is intended by the treaty to go to the EU. Has that issue been addressed by the working party and what conclusions were reached?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on a quite lengthy debate. When we first raised the issue of subsidiarity, the response was, of course, that the court already needed to take that into account. Our response to that was, yes, but national Parliaments should be able to say whether they agree with the assessment. Without giving them a veto or allowing them to delay the proposed mechanism, national Parliaments should have the ability to flag up a warning card.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that was quite significant was that for the first time it was recognised that the decision on subsidiarity is more political in the early stages and becomes judicial only once legislative proposals have been finalised. We have tried with the proposed mechanism to have a much deeper political decision before it becomes a judicial decision. The current mechanism allows referral to the European Court of Justice only at the very end of the process. There was a big debate about the third point. Very often one cannot separate subsidiarity and proportionality.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
What causes the greatest problems is the proportionality of the proposal, rather than whether it should be done at European and national level. The involvement process, which allows continuous questioning, has been strengthened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subsidiarity principle has been in treaty law since Maastricht and was reinforced at Amsterdam. In truth, however, it has never really worked because no institution has had a serious interest in enforcing it. There is now a proposal that a proportion of national Parliaments should request the Commission to look again at a proposal to see if it abides by the subsidiarity principle but the Commission can still ignore that, so in its present form the proposal is not sufficiently strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsidiarity, even if observed, would not cure the democratic deficit. There would still be a blizzard of regulations, often connected in some way with the single market, which engulfed national Parliaments and the people we represent. Therefore, we must get national Parliaments in right at the start of the legislative chain, and the right of initiative must be removed from the Commission. It is scary that 20 unelected people in Europe have the sole right to initiate legislation in Europe. Until that changes, the cynicism and despair felt about democracy in the European Union will persist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the formal position of our Government that we support the continuation of the European Union as an association of independent states. That is a position that I support. However, does my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston not agree that we seem to be in a process of inexorable and incremental change, which, over time, will end in fundamental changes? Will it not lead to the abandonment of independent states and the creation of a centralised European state?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend expresses a legitimate fear, but I urge him to take on board two things. First, the central building block of the nation state is unquestioned in the process that we are discussing. I find it surprising that the right hon. Member for Wells should propose that we take the right of initiative away from the Commission. That would question whether nation states should be represented by their Governments, and we do not question that, because it is a necessary building block.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as Lord Tomlinson said, there is a recognition that this permanent revolution, which is going further and further, must end. It must have a much clearer definition. The Dutch Government representative expressed opposition to the idea of the congress to emerge from the working group. He said, "You have created an institution that every time it meets, by the very fact of its existence, wishes to produce something that it can be proud of." In that context, he could not see that there could be anything other than further integration. It is hugely important that that comes out of the Convention. It is not what people wish to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howell of Guildford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the idea of a reasoned opinion in each national Parliament on new legislative items. However, was there any suggestion in the working group of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston that the same brake should be applied to existing competences in the acquis? Given that over time all sorts of powers have accumulated that may be inappropriate for central handling, were any ideas proposed about filtering and sifting through the acquis, through national Parliaments, so that a better balance of competences can be achieved? That is also a question for my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and his working group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am referring to a larger question than that of subsidiarity. However, we might challenge the word itself, as it is completely inappropriate, because no one is "sub" anyone else. It is time for a change of wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read Lord Howell's letter in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> today, which raised some interesting issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the fact that the final report of the working group on national Parliaments is available on the table. The working group touched on the definition of subsidiarity, but we ended up saying that we needed to work with the definition in the treaty of Amsterdam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen on the following idea, although we have not reached a stage in the Convention when it would be appropriate to raise it. Creating a mechanism to revise the acquis would be a mammoth task and would not achieve much. In whatever treaty proposals we table, there will have to be an established mechanism not just for shared competence, which already exists in current treaties, but for national competence. The creation of a two-way valve is important. The issue is not that it has not yet been discussed in the Convention as an idea that should not be put on the table, but that we have another nine or 10 months to work on it, and it will be looked at when we consider the institutional arrangements in the new year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, my concern about my working group is that at present there is a one-way escalator from member states to the EU on legislative competence and it is easy to see how that has arisen. On health, a treaty article, which was negotiated by member states, lays down clearly that public health—the organisation and funding of health care—should be a member state competence. However, under general single market articles, it is treated as a service and services are traded, so it is a single market matter. The treatment of EU citizens in various member states is now governed not by the original health article negotiated at Maastricht or Amsterdam, but by the so-called rubber article governing the single market, as interpreted by the European Court of Justice, which is itself an EU institution and, therefore, tends to centralise powers. Until we make it clear beyond doubt who does what in treaty law, unalterable by the court or the use of rubber articles, no citizen of the EU will have the faintest idea who does what.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Donald Anderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that in the second wave of working groups set up in September, there is a working group on defence, chaired by Commissioner Barnier, who will have all the resources of the Commission to assist him in that task. That working group is special because defence has always been considered to be very much within the province of national Governments. I should be grateful to know from my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston, who is, I believe, a member of that working group, a little more about the timetable, the working methods and the expertise that will be available to question Mr. Barnier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a member of the defence group, which is interesting for several reasons, including the separation of defence and external relations. It is intrinsically a separate group on that; we just look at defence. It is emerging clearly that what is wrong at the moment is lack of capacity on the ground. We have heard evidence from Mr. Solana, military manufacturers and Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, so we have listened to experts. There is capability on paper, but real capability does not exist in many ways: for example, in relation to co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politically it is interesting in that, for the first time in the life of the Convention, candidate countries have stood up and said, "This is a red line for us. If you do anything that interferes with NATO, we shall say no." There is a huge commitment to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are examining two areas. The first is whether it would be sensible to change the current procurement arrangements for military equipment throughout Europe and to have more co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second idea that has been floated, to which the candidate countries have again said no, is whether the potential of an equivalent of article 5 should be considered in the EU context. I would find that extremely difficult to accept because that is not the nature of current EU defence policy, which is peacekeeping and conflict prevention. It is not a defensive organisation. I would want a strengthening of the way in which it works with NATO and a buildup of capacity without undermining NATO in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The members of the United Kingdom parliamentary team will be aware that in the run up to the selection of parliamentary representatives there was a vigorous debate in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on whether the fact that there is now more than one parliamentary assembly should be reflected in the delegation. That leads me to the involvement of United Kingdom parliamentary delegation members and whether they have raised issues relating to subsidiarity. There seems to be a curious notion that subsidiarity stops with member states when most people understand subsidiarity to mean decisions being made at the level closest to citizens. May I ask the full members of the UK parliamentary team whether they argued in favour of enhanced scrutiny powers at sub-member state level during their deliberations and whether they argued for assemblies such as the Scottish Executive to have power of direct access to the European Court of Justice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and I have been to Northern Ireland and Edinburgh to discuss those matters. I strongly agree that they are right at the end of the food chain. We in this House sometimes feel that we merely rubber-stamp proposals and turn them into law without any real input or even knowledge of how the proposals were conceived, and the situation is much worse when the proposals reach Belfast or Edinburgh. Although the arrangement of powers within a member state is not a matter for the European Union, it would be the prime beneficiary if we could return some of the powers or competences to member state level. We could then redistribute them within our own countries. More specifically, in reply to one of the hon. Gentleman's questions, if there is to be a system of giving member state Parliaments an objection on grounds of subsidiarity, which is welcome although inadequate, that should be extended to give other assemblies and sub-national Parliaments the same powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to add that, besides there being four parliamentary representatives, at every plenary meeting of the convention we make a point of convening a meeting of all the British representatives so that we can benefit from a wider exchange of views. That means that Government representatives, British European parliamentarians and the parliamentary representatives come together with civil servants. With such dialogue we have the benefit of the advice of, for example, someone like Neil MacCormick, who is a member of the Convention representing the European Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is proposed that the single legal personality should replace existing ones. The existing ones include defence, foreign affairs, justice and home affairs. Previously, it was ascertained by national Governments that such matters could not be compromised or Europeanised, but if we have a single legal personality, it seems that such matters will be subsumed into one treaty. I should like clarification of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be convenient if I tried to answer that question as I was a member of the group that made the recommendation. First, the attribution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that I am partially deaf, and that it would make things easier if Members spoke in my direction and with a slightly raised voice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more than happy to do so. Sharing that physical difficulty with you, Mr. Cook, I understand entirely what you say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was endeavouring to make the point that the simple attribution of legal personality by the treaty has no effect whatever on the competences of the Union in respect of foreign or defence policies—or, for that matter, in respect of justice and home affairs. It makes clear what has hitherto probably been clear only to the lawyers who have been advising the Government, as well as those who have been advising the European Union's institutions—that the Union is capable of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
suing and being sued in its own name. That is about the beginning and end of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for what the working group had to say about the conduct of foreign and defence policies in light of its recommendation that the Union should have a single legal personality, it is clear that it was not part of the ratio decidendi—I use the lawyers' expression. It was considered sensible to point out some of the problems that would result from giving the Union a single legal personality and the fact that the need for a single voice could be dealt with in other ways—ways that should be considered by the groups considering foreign and defence policies. The only surprise was that that group took roughly seven meetings to arrive at a decision that could have been made in an hour, even allowing everyone to participate. It was not a profound decision with necessary or earth-shattering consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with another point helpfully made by Lord Stoddart about the wrapping up of the pillars—a subject referred to by the right hon. Member for Wells. No necessary consequences flow from the single personality decision in that respect. It was made clear in the working group's report that the protections provided for both second and third pillar decision making could be retained within a single treaty—and that they should be so retained in respect of at least some matters. However, that will be considered again by the working groups on home affairs and defence policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Just in case any noble, right hon. or hon. Members have forgotten, it is beneficial to have brief questions and brief answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Redwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wokingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to our representatives for reporting back. From all that we have heard and seen, it seems that the European joyriders are still in our car, that the car is thundering through the night, that it is raining and that they are trying to keep us in the dark about the power grab. If the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston is to be proved right about the charming visage that she presents of a sudden outbreak of democracy and national independence within the European Union, surely we must see a massive transfer of competences from the Union to member states, the abolition of the qualified majority vote and the restoration of the veto; and there must be a clear statement that powers will be transferred back. Can she tell us of any power, on any important area, that is likely to be returned to member states? Can she tell us of any veto that will be restored? If not, I cannot believe a word of what we have heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is refreshing to listen to the right hon. Gentleman, and those of us who were in danger of dozing off have thoroughly woken up again. However, he misunderstands the Convention process. It would be wholly inappropriate for the Convention to pick out particular areas at the end of the year, but it would be appropriate, while consolidating the treaties, for us to establish a mechanism to allow that to happen. At present there is no mechanism, and there clearly must be one. It is also clear that, for example, any treaty would have to include a clause on leaving the Union. The Convention's role is to pull treaty provisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
together, make them more transparent and allow for a two-way flow. I am confident that that will happen. Which bits flow which way is a political decision, which we will have to face later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wayne David 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a slightly more positive note, the right hon. Member for Wells expressed concern about the Commission's right of initiative. Seen in a vacuum, that concern is understandable, but it is important to recognise from our discussions on subsidiarity that national Parliaments will have a more significant role. It is also important to recognise that the Convention has discussed enhancing the Council's role. Will my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston say a few words about that and, in particular, about the discussion of the six-month presidency and of whether the Council should take a more strategic role in the development of the Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Convention has not yet got to the point of studying all the other institutional arrangements. The first non-European Union institutions that we considered were national Parliaments; it is a kind of anchoring process. What emerged from the discussions in the working group on national Parliaments was that the Council of Ministers must be much more open and that national Parliaments must know what Ministers have done on their behalf. At present, they do not know, because the Council is held behind closed doors. There is also the issue of the flow of information during the conciliation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real feeling that the six-month presidency cannot continue with its current structure, although there can still be hosting presidencies. That is something for the new year. The first 10 working groups are smaller bodies, and I expect institutional arrangements to be debated at the plenary session in the new year; the issue cannot simply be farmed out to small groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that a horrible Community method is at work and that everyone will get something and go away happy, claiming success. There is a danger that the Commission will keep its existing powers at the end of the process and perhaps augment them; it has certainly bid for extra powers in the fields of crime, security and foreign policy. The Council may also get more powers, as the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David) said. The European Parliament always gets something, as it has done following the last three treaty changes. National Parliaments will get a new, exciting scrutiny role as a result of subsidiarity, although that would not be necessary if the treaties worked as they should. The only people not to get more powers will be the electors, but it is they who feel alienated. I am afraid that they will say at the end of the process that a lot of politicians spent a year talking and distributed more powers, competences, duties and probably money, but that they left the public out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Convention worthy of the name should start to set priorities, because something has to give. Personally, I would make the Commission into a secretariat, which would service the will of the people, as expressed through their Parliaments. However, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
kind of radical thinking is entirely absent. That is the big difference between Brussels in 2002 and Philadelphia in 1787, where people started by asking what the nature of government was and whether it was possible to have a federal Government on a continental scale. Until people begin asking such questions, all we shall have is an institutional bargaining session, and the public will pay the price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a different perspective to this. I support the Commission's having the sole right of initiative, but that must be properly used and controlled. That places an enormous responsibility on the Council of Ministers to say no at an early stage to that which it regards as nonsense. National Parliaments, through their scrutiny procedures, therefore have an equally responsible role to play in ensuring that Ministers know what is considered unacceptable as a Commission proposal. They now have an additional important role: to make sure that the proposed early warning system for subsidiarity works. That is one of the surest ways of ensuring that there are fewer legislative proposals as any extension of the base of those who can make legislative proposals is a certain guarantee that there will be more, rather than less, legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Willoughby de Broke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the noble Lord why he believes that the 20 unelected members of the Commission should retain the right? He has said that they should, but has not told us why. It would be interesting to find out why those people, some politically successful, others less so, should continue to have the right to propose legislation that affects all the electors in the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say that because there is a frequently voiced misconception that European legislation is made by unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. Of course, the Commissioners have no vote in the legislation; they merely make the proposal. If there is a major problem in relation to the quality of legislation, national Parliaments have a responsibility to examine their scrutiny methods, the degree to which they hold their Ministers accountable and the facility with which national Ministers allow legislative proposals to proceed when they should be ditched at an early stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Tynan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the national parliamentary caucus meeting on 3 October, the right hon. Member for Wells, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston, said that he felt that national parliamentarians should be bolder and more demanding. Will he explain what he meant by that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will. I think that we are being outplayed, because the game takes place on someone else's pitch. We go to Brussels, the home of the European Parliament, where all know each other well and work as a team. Members of other member states' Governments turn up, wonderfully supported by the usual phalanx of civil servants, whereas we arrive, not knowing each other, and are treated as tourists in someone else's building. We are at an institutional disadvantage and are not thinking as a group of people who want to democratise the European Union, in the knowledge that most people
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
exercise their democratic choices through their member state Parliaments. It is, perhaps, inconvenient and unpopular to say that, but it is a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states' Parliaments and their representatives should not accept—important and welcome though it is—the comparatively minor concession that we shall have a role in policing a mechanism like subsidiarity, which should be happening anyway. Instead, we should be much bolder, not in trying to enhance the powers of our own institutions, but in trying to breathe democracy through this European Union decision-making and legislative structure, which I regard as almost comically undemocratic, as is shown by the electors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The electors are trying to tell us something. Why did less than a quarter of our fellow citizens even bother to vote in the last European Parliament elections in 1999? Why did the Danes, despite all the pressure on them, vote no to the Euro? Why did the Irish, of all people, vote no last year to the treaty of Nice? Then, of course, they were asked the same question on the same treaty and were overwhelmed by the pressure and the money and the bullying. People are trying to send us a message. If we persist in not listening to it, the whole project risks catastrophe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add a very brief, fundamental word of clarification? I do not accept the notion of those who suggest that there is a lack of democratic legitimacy in the European Union. There are two sources of democracy. One is direct elections, which we have for the European Parliament, and the other is representation by Ministers. I do not want to unravel my representation by the British Government, which is an essential building block in my and other citizens' representation at European level. It is, first and foremost, parliamentarians' role to scrutinise and influence at home Ministers' actions in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the argument that democratic legitimacy is lacking and that therefore we need to unravel representation by Government is more of a wrecking mission than a serious suggestion of a way forward. The logical outcome of that argument would be to set up a federal state of Europe with everyone directly elected, and cut off the nation state. I do not subscribe to that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is possible to argue—and it is being argued in the European Union—that there is a deficit not only of democracy, but effectiveness, and that to some extent the public's disaffection with Europe may be attributed to Europe's failure to respond to the issues that cannot effectively be dealt with by national Governments. I am thinking, for example, of the debate about justice and home affairs, to which exception has been taken on the ground that those are matters for the nation state. The reality is that the nation state has patently failed in some of the areas in which there is now an attribution of power—for example, immigration control, cross-border crime and drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the public are disaffected it is not because the Union is being over-emphatic in those matters, but because the Union has not delivered. There should be, and will be, at least as much attention paid in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Convention to that deficit as to the others that have been rather more the focus of attention today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lilley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hitchin and Harpenden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston mentioned that many participants in the Convention had articulated the widespread resentment at the apparent continuous, one-way, incremental, piecemeal transfer of powers from member states to the European institutions. She invited us to believe that the establishment of a constitution as a result of the Convention would put an end to that process. Her suggestion might work on a primary school audience, but I find it insulting to be invited to accept such a non sequitur, particularly given that the hon. Lady revealed its absurdity when she talked about processes to vet subsequent changes or proposed changes of competence, which would have to undergo the subsidiarity procedure. The establishment of a constitution will clearly not put an end to the problem, but make it possible for such changes to be made by majority voting: if they were to be made by unanimity there would be no need for the process in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Lady aware that when the Conservative Government had to negotiate the original subsidiarity clause we were advised by the highest legal authorities that it was impossible to frame any clause effectively to prevent a transfer of power? Either there would be unanimous approval by all member states or the proposal would be passed by majority and vetted by the European Court; the court would then rule that if a majority of members had voted in favour there must be good practical reasons for the decision. There was no way of phrasing a law to prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which the hon. Lady could demonstrate a genuine will on the part of the Convention to move towards subsidiarity would be by presenting evidence, of the kind requested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), of a single proposal to transfer competence from the European institutions back to the member states. If she cannot do that, we must accept that the on-going process will be accelerated, not slowed, by the Convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the right hon. Gentleman that I hold him in too high esteem to want to insult his intelligence. His question, raising the issue of whether the mere existence of a constitution would be a safeguard, is a penetrating one. However, the constitution will pull together for the first time all the various treaties, which have developed higgledy-piggledy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that at that stage there will be much greater clarity as to who should perform what function. For example, the Commission's role must be much more clearly defined. Some problems occur because the Commission is trying to do too much and is not doing well. It should be much firmer on certain areas. I agree that, if there were no two-way valve in any treaty at the end of the Convention to allow that, it would be deeply disappointing. It is right to say that
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the existence of such a valve is vital to the serious future of the European Union, a Union of 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Lea of Crondall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the remark by Mr. Heathcoat-Amory that what happened in Philadelphia in 1787 was the working out of exactly what needed to be done by the centre and by the states—or words to that effect. That is interesting because it took them 11 years, from 1776 to 1787, to get where they got to, and then there was something called the United States of America. In one way, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy to say that we have got to the united states of Europe, simply because the analogy is with Philadelphia in 1787. Once we start saying that the analogy is with Philadelphia in 1787, that becomes the result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should like to ask Mr. Heathcoat-Amory and other colleagues whether we have the following problem. Even if we had a constitutional outcome—the word "constitution" comes into the conversation—that did the maximum to define a separation of powers, subsidiarity and so on, as he wishes, would it not inescapably still be thought to be something like that of Philadelphia in 1787, precisely because we are now talking about a written constitution? However, is not the upside of that that it would still be the best thing for Britain to go for in the Convention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best commentary on American democracy was written by a Frenchman called de Tocqueville, with whom I am sure Lord Lea is familiar. He identified certain conditions for a federal democracy, including a common language and, perhaps more important, a common political culture. However, those are absent in Europe at present. Today, de Tocqueville would certainly say that we cannot construct anything approaching an American-style federal system in a continent as diverse as ours. Therefore attempts to democratise institutions such as the present Council or Commission are doomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is much better to bring democracy back to the people and to work where there is a political demos, a public opinion, a people, a shared political experience and language at the level of member state. That does not rule out co-operation with other member states, the closest possible relations or even the synthesis of common positions on areas such as foreign policy. However, that cannot be constructed on anything like a federal or quasi-federal level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the lesson of the American democracy, but the type of thinking that we have heard in the past few minutes is entirely absent in Brussels this year. We are straight down to business, with everyone trying to bid for what they want in their own particular interest, with preconceived notions. At the start, I tried to introduce a little more blue sky thinking, but I was rapidly disillusioned, so at the moment I am just trying to fight my own corner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the theme of blue sky thinking, I note that the early sittings in June and between 9 and 12 July were to hear the advice of civil society. In fact, the European youth convention took place from 9 to 12 July. I had the pleasure of meeting a convention member, who was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
buoyed up by what he thought he had taken part in. The document states that the young people represented in the convention
	<br><blockquote><p>"demand a European Union which offers a vision of a united and democratic future, one which offers accessible government to all its citizens, and one which has the instruments of legitimacy to meet their expectations."</p></blockquote>
What view did the UK representatives take of that submission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took the view that the views of the right hon. Member for Wells were extremely important but not representative of those that had been expressed to the Convention. Although there was no prospect, and the prospect should not even be considered, of a United States of America, many people in this country—it was the youth of this country with whom I had the greatest contact—are capable of having loyalties to more than one political unit. As a Scot I find it not in the least difficult to support a Scottish Parliament and to feel attached to its decisions in respect of its functions. Similarly, as a Briton, I feel attached to the British Parliament and its traditions and its responsibilities. As a European I feel attached to what the European Union can do, which clearly cannot be done at national level. That view came through loud and clear from the representations that we received from the young people to whom the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Waddington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was completely baffled by the remarks of Lord Tomlinson. Why should the Commission alone have the right to propose legislation? Why should it be assumed that if others had the right to propose legislation it would mean more legislation? Surely one of the great advantages in allowing Governments to propose legislation is that they could also propose the repeal of legislation. The Commission will never propose that legislation should be removed from the statute book of the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that Lord Waddington is baffled, as I think that I explained the position as I see it quite clearly. I believe that it is better for those two institutions—the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament—either individually or together to exercise their legislative responsibility totally and completely, subject to the controls of their electorate and their Parliaments. In those circumstances I remain a supporter of the proposal that the right of initiative should be with the Commission, particularly where there is improvement of the proposals for subsidiarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Hendrick 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Preston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Convention representatives whether in the absence of European Government it is perfectly logical that the Commission should be able to propose legislation? In addition is it not a fact that none of that can become legislation unless the Commission work programme is approved by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and that the legislation receives Readings in both the Council and the Parliament by democratically elected Members of Parliament and Governments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Increasingly national Parliaments are taking it as part of their responsibilities to scrutinise Commission work programmes. The more effectively
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
they do that, the more effectively they can let their Ministers know the sort of views they expect of them within the framework of the Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of us would tolerate a situation in which a very small group of unelected people had sole right of initiative if the system were under any sort of democratic control or could be amended within our own country. It is intolerable and it is has contributed to the phenomenon of the accumulation of laws touched on by Lord Waddington. The acquis communautaire is now thought to run to 85,000 pages, as the Commission adds but seldom repeals. Worse, we are now to dump this quantity of legislation on to some very small states that are seeking to join the European Union. How can Malta or Estonia, in all seriousness, realistically cope with the colossal burden of regulations and other laws? That is what we have inherited. The Commission takes no interest in correcting, amending or repealing it, because it is always pressing on to new pastures and new unoccupied ground, which it makes its own preserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief observation. The Council of Ministers is perfectly capable of asking the Commission to make proposals, which it properly does. It is therefore right to leave the power of initiative with the Commission, not least because as soon as responsibilities are divided, accountability is too. Members may want other institutions to be given the power of initiative, but the only institution currently requesting it is the European Parliament. Do they really want the European Parliament to have it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jim Dobbin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have talked quite a lot this afternoon about effective scrutiny. Can our representatives suggest areas of improvement, which might have been gleaned from other models of scrutiny in other national Parliaments, which would improve our system in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks a question that was very much on the mind of the working group on national Parliaments—comparing how the various systems worked. We took great note of reports of both Houses, and of the experience of the scrutiny Committees. Some of the member states have systems that are good in their own contexts. We discovered that some of the Scandinavian groups, which scrutinise at great depth, became a mechanism of compensatory sovereignty, which they openly admitted. As long they have a seat at the table and can examine everything in great detail, they feel that they are part of the process. I want to see more than just the papers. There should be a real input at an early stage, which is why the flow of information should happen much earlier. Our recommendation that Commission proposals should go direct to national Parliaments is a step forward. It is no longer the function of the Government to forward them, as the annual programme is much greater. At the end of the day, the most significant input that national Parliaments can make is to hold their own Ministers to account about what they do at a European level and to consider how they can improve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The working group on the simplification of legislation is currently working on the absolute need for openness on the part of the Council about its role as a legislative body. It is, as it were, the second chamber of the European Parliament, and although steps were taken at Lisbon that marked an advance, they did not go far enough. The working group argued that when the Council is sitting as part of the legislative process, its proceedings should be held entirely in public. They should be fully reported in print. Effective scrutiny of the European Parliament, never mind of national Parliaments, will not be possible unless that step is taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be of interest to hon. Members and Lords to know that in the House of Lords, for example, the European Union Committee is currently considering scrutiny. Last week, we had the benefit of hearing from the Danish parliamentarians about their system. This week, we have had the great benefit of hearing from my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood), who gave extensive evidence. In particular, we are considering how we would deal with any new proposals on subsidiarity within the time framework available to us for the scrutiny of documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston for withdrawing the suggestion that the constitution would be the end of the road. However, she went on to insult my intelligence again by asking me to believe the "It's just a process of simplification" thesis. If the matter were one of simplification, such as Lord Howe's programme of simplification of tax revenue, it would not require a Convention. Simplification would involve a group of people producing a simpler codification of existing law. It would not involve many proposals for changes in competence; the report contains many proposals for changes to the responsibilities of institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just flicked through the progress report, and have seen references to the common emigration policy and the common asylum policy. There are proposals for changes in responsibility. If that were not so, why would we need a Convention? If there are such proposals, why cannot the Convention propose some transfers back to member states? If it does not do so, we will know what the Convention is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I quickly deal with the issue of changes in competence? Those changes have not been proposed, and are most unlikely to be proposed. That is not part of the remit of the Convention. The examples that the right hon. Gentleman adduced are of policies that were accepted under earlier treaties, some of which were made when he was a member of the Government. On the justice and home affairs examples, those have been competences of the European Union for a considerable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded of the phrase, "Just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean they're not after you." I suggest that there is a slight hint of paranoia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need the Convention because those at successive intergovernmental conferences have tried to bring
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
about a simplification, and could not. They tried to have a more rational system, and felt that they could not achieve that. The Florence Institute is doing some work on sheer simplification, but that is not enough. The constitution is a definition of who should have what powers, and gives much greater clarity. I urge the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) to have good faith, to wait nine months and to see how the constitution will look then. He may well then no longer think that they are all after him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the possible subsidiarity "lock on the door" will apply only to future transfers of competence from member states to the EU, and not to things that have already gone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall be brief to allow as many hon. Members to contribute as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to concentrate on matters covered by the report of the Convention's working group on national Parliaments. What I say will not surprise my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston. Many noble, right hon. and hon. Members may have seen the Select Committee on European Scrutiny's press release of last Wednesday, which said that we were disappointed by the draft report. I emphasise that our criticism is certainly not directed at the chairman of the working group, my hon. Friend. We know that she has had to work on the basis of consensus and that powerful vested interests are represented in her working group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were disappointed, partly because there seemed to be consensus that increasing national Parliaments' role in the European Union was a way of helping to bridge the gap between citizens and EU institutions. The treaty of Nice listed the role of national Parliaments as one of four subjects to be discussed at the next intergovernmental conference. The Laeken declaration asked questions about increasing the role of national Parliaments, and the United Kingdom Government said that developing the role of national Parliaments in the EU was one of their priorities for the Convention. Even the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs accepted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the solidity of national democratic frameworks and their closeness to the citizens are an essential asset which can in no way be ignored in pursuing the parliamentarisation of the Union."</p></blockquote>
In view of all that, it was not unreasonable to expect that the Convention would bring forward proposals that would make a significant difference to national Parliaments' ability to exert influence in the EU, but without creating a new institution, such as a second
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
chamber, and without giving a formal role in the legislative process to national Parliaments. The Select Committee on European Scrutiny, of which I am Chairman, put forward its own ideas in its report entitled "Democracy and Accountability in the EU and the Role of National Parliaments."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the discussion about a new role addressed enforcement of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and my Committee made a proposal. However, we are less worried about the specific mechanism used than about ensuring that objections made by national Parliaments on grounds of subsidiarity have an impact rather than being brushed aside. That is where much of our disappointment arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group's report, in line with that of the working group on subsidiarity, provides for national Parliaments to object at an early stage. However, there would be no requirement for anyone to take the slightest notice of that objection or to respond to it. The emphasis in the report is entirely on ensuring that the new procedure does not cause any delay in the legislative process. The working group on subsidiarity is right to emphasise that it would be the first time that national Parliaments would be involved in the EU's legislative process, but it seems that such involvement would be without influence. If there is no possibility of delay, the involvement of national Parliaments can be no more than a formality. As I said in a press release:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a real watchdog does not just convey views; it barks, and occasionally bites."</p></blockquote>
The second disappointment relates to matters that affect the scrutiny that we may carry out in Westminster and other national Parliaments. I am pleased that the draft report recognises that the way in which the EU operates can affect national Parliaments' ability to hold their Governments to account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but I should draw the attention of all members of the Committee to the fact that there is a Division in the Lords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am also pleased that the draft report stresses the need for greater openness in the Council. However, it ignores such important issues as the need for time for scrutiny before a radically revised text is put to the Council for agreement. It says nothing about the conciliation process, which, with its secrecy and back-room deals, is as much an affront to democratic principles as the Council of Ministers meeting in private. I cite an example of that: the European Parliament agreed not to breach financial ceilings in return for getting an early retirement scheme for the temporary staff of its political groups. Our two alternate members are on the working group on simplifying legal instruments, and I hope that they will oppose any extension of the co-decision and conciliation process, unless it is made much more transparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report adopts our suggestion that parliamentary scrutiny reserves should be given formal status in the Council's rules of procedure, but when the decision is by qualified majority voting, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
explicitly encourages the Council to go ahead without waiting. Apparently, pressing on regardless is more important than allowing the small amount of time needed for scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some good things in the report, such as encouraging the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees to draw up minimum standards of parliamentary scrutiny, and exploring the possibility of introducing new ways of bringing MPs and MEPs together for discussion. However, it is not clear to me whether anything in the report will significantly increase the role and influence of national Parliaments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the working group well. I also wish its chairman—my hon. Friend—well, and I hope that she, through her membership of the praesidium, and the other UK parliamentary representatives on the Convention will take the role of national Parliaments much more seriously, and put forward proposals that will make a real difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Convention would facilitate genuine debate between the integrationists and the intergovernmentalists—if I may describe the two sides of the argument in that way. That argument is taking place in public life, in the media and in this Parliament, and I had hoped that the Convention would take both of those sets of views into account to see whether there was some way of fitting them together—to the extent that that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not particularly care whether the outcome is called a constitution—although constitutions tend to go with nation states—and I can see the sense of separating the institutional rules from the decisions that are made by those institutions. However, regardless of what it is called, I would like it to reflect what I want the European Union to continue as: an organisation primarily of intergovernmental arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On some matters, I could have made a better argument for the Commission to have the right to initiate legislation than that put by Lord Tomlinson: if the Commission had not had that right, very little would have been done under the single market chapter. However, its right to initiate should be confined to that. If the Commission is going to start invading the second and third pillars of this treaty, and if those pillars are going to collapse, that is pretty fundamental. Indeed, I am surprised that we are talking about the collapse of those pillars before the working groups on justice and home affairs, on foreign policy and on defence have reported. None of our Governments' duties are more fundamentally important than the defence of our countries, and of us as their citizens. Those matters must remain intergovernmental, as must the administration of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are of course cross-border dimensions to these matters: there must be co-operation on foreign policy and defence, and on trans-national crime—of which there is far too much. However, that does not mean that the final say over them should be removed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
from national Governments, who have vetoes with regard to those pillars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the intergovernmentalists have already lost the battle. They certainly seem to have lost it in the Convention, and I suspect that they are going to lose it in the intergovernmental conference that follows. However, I wish to make a plea to our representatives. On this matter, I regard all four of them as my representatives, and I want them to ensure that the case that I have put is reflected in the discussions—and, I hope, in the conclusions—even if it merely appears somewhere at the bottom of the a la carte menu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be looking carefully at four things. If the pillars are collapsed—especially those on foreign policy and defence, but to some extent those on justice and home affairs too—and if the Commission is given a role in those matters, that will be a fundamental erosion of intergovernmentalism, and it will show that there is no end to the ambitions of the European Union and the Commission in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the proposals for strengthening subsidiarity do not go nearly far enough. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston says that the matter would be initially political and latterly legal. However, that is not how our law would deal with it. Our courts decide whether statutory bodies that derive their powers from Acts of Parliament have acted ultra vires. Such bodies—indeed, the Government—should have a view in advance about whether they would be acting ultra vires if they were asked do so something. At the end of the day, such decisions are political, but the final jurisdiction is a legal one: has that body exceeded the powers that were delegated to it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem in the European Union is that every bit of the juggernaut is moving in the same direction. The European Court has demonstrated a marked reluctance to limit the powers of the European Union, especially those of the Commission. It should be explicitly stated in the treaty that the powers must be cast in a restrictive light and not left open to interpretation—that just because member states want something or because everybody voted for it, it is the right thing to do. We are delegating powers—or at least, that is what we are told—to the European Union and to the Commission. Therefore, those powers must be interpreted in a restrictive not constructivist manner. If that is not written into the treaty and we do not strengthen the powers on subsidiarity in what used to be article 3b of the Maastricht treaty, we will not halt the juggernaut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the charter of fundamental rights is incorporated into the treaties, the war as well as the battle will be lost. It is not a charter of fundamental rights. It is a charter of political aspirations. I am all for it—I completely agree with most of the rights, but interpretation of them should be left to national Parliaments. For example, the charter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everyone has the right to education and to have access to vocational and continuing training."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
As a political aspiration, I agree with that. However, it should be a matter for our Parliament. I do not think that every European country must have vocational training, but if such a right is incorporated into the treaty, the Commission will get active, the Court will become active and, before we know what is happening, every aspect of the right will have been invaded by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider another example:

to ensure a decent existence. I recognise that too, but it is not a fundamental right in a legal sense. It is not the same as the right to free speech or to a fair trial, which I would be happy to see dealt with in a European Court. We have the European Court of Human Rights to judge on those matters. However, if such political aspirations are the subject of legal construction and legal action by the Community, frankly, we have lost the war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to my concerns about what may be in the Convention, I am concerned about one absence from it. If the Community is to involve member states in a more integrationist way—which is the conclusion that I reluctantly draw from what I have heard today and read and experienced in 20-odd years in this game—we need greater flexibility in the treaty. There is a series of provisions that allows groups of member states to proceed with enhanced co-operation, if that is what they want. If the treaty is to be amended to allow the integrationist agenda to proceed, member states must have the right, for example, to different types of membership, or not to have to subscribe to every measure that is introduced. There must be flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the final analysis, perhaps there should be an explicit right to leave the Community at the will of one's own nation state rather than requiring, as some of the proposals have, the consent of other member states. We need a stage before that—another side to the coin of the enhanced flexibility provisions—to allow member states not to subscribe to new legislation, except in the core area of the single market and free trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all of my concerns are not met, I fear that we shall be rearranging the driving shifts on the juggernaut, but not discussing its direction, what is on the juggernaut or how long it will take to reach its destination. That will turn the juggernaut into a Titanic. If all of the things that I have mentioned are in the treaty, we will have a massive democratic deficit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by thanking all our representatives on the Convention? They have participated in a largely constructive and positive way so far, which is a step forward in itself. For too long, we have been seen as a nation on the sidelines of the EU, rather than in the mainstream of the real cut and thrust of political debate. That has fundamentally changed, which I welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that significant progress has been made because, fundamentally, the EU is a construct in which independent sovereign states come together and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
decide to pool their sovereignty from time to time in their individual best interests. That is the essential model behind the EU, and much of what we have heard tonight is complementary to that vision. However, much work still needs to be done. In particular, there needs to be greater emphasis on the work of the Council of Ministers in the next few months. Whatever modifications we might want to be made to EU institutions, if we believe that the European Union is essentially an association of sovereign states, the role of such a council of ministers is fundamental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have reservations if the Convention were to suggest that there should be a single-pillar structure. There is much to be said for maintaining and developing intergovernmental co-operation, particularly as far as a common foreign and security policy is concerned. Justice and home affairs are a different matter; events in the past couple of years have shown the need for a more communautaire approach on many issues that have been regarded as matters of national interest. We have a collective identity; one has only to look at the problems we face to realise that. However, the role of national Parliaments is fundamental to the future development of the European Union because national Parliaments are the institutions closest to the electorate of our representative states. That is an objective fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome many of the recommendations in the report of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston. There is a need to emphasise the desirability of the Council to work with more openness and to ensure a greater dialogue and better communication with our institutions and national Parliaments. The Amsterdam treaty protocol should be implemented in its entirety. The body known as COSAC—I had the dubious privilege of representing this Parliament in COSAC last week—needs to be fundamentally reformed. It should be given a clear mandate to develop an interparliamentary consultative mechanism. At present, it is simply a talking shop, and that is to put it politely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There needs to be fundamental emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity, which, essentially, is a political, rather than a judicial, term. The role of national Parliaments is crucial. I express my reservations too, as the mechanism proposed in the report does not go far enough. To quote briefly from paragraph 26, the report recommends that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A mechanism should be set up to allow national parliaments to convey early on in the legislative process their views on the compliance of a legislative proposal with the principle of subsidiarity."</p></blockquote>
That is all well and good. However, the next sentence states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a mechanism should be process-based and it should not hinder or delay the legislative process."</p></blockquote>
Frankly, given that second sentence, what is the point of the first one? The point of national Parliaments scrutinising Commission proposals is that they may hinder, delay or change those legislative proposals. It is important, therefore, that a clear message should go
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
out from this national Parliament to our representatives that that is what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been extremely useful; the process is working, warts and all. I hope that the Convention's deliberations will be positive and, above all, in the national interests of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as they go, some of the proposals from the working group are very useful. I particularly welcome the move to make the Commission transmit all consultative documents to national Parliaments and for Council working groups not to acknowledge preliminary agreements on proposals until the six-week period is up. I hope not to argue about provisional agreements, which the Government have rightly eschewed and decided not to use as a phrase, or that the Commission should present its annual legislative programme to national Parliaments. I agree with others that COSAC should be either replaced or beefed up and given teeth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston will suggest to her group colleagues that it is not just a question of new legislative items. Hitherto, people have said that it is impossible to open up the acquis communautaire. From what Lord Tomlinson, Lord Maclennan, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells have said, I do not know whether I would be right in assuming that it is no longer untouchable and that we can begin to get a democratic surveyance of the huge powers, some of which are completely out of date and unnecessary, that it has accumulated. That should be an extension of the wrongly named subsidiarity process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that there is a focus on scrutiny and scrutiny reserve. Is it possible for the Convention to examine the idea of entrenching that and making it a formal part of the legislative and decision-making processes in the European Union? Could it even be made mandatory? No one is saying that we can bully every member state into scrutiny reserve procedures, but there is nothing against binding ourselves in our own legislation and requiring that a scrutiny reserve is mandatory. Those are the issues on which some progress seems to have been made, but much more is needed if we are to return power to national Parliaments, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) has requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some general points, and I shall try to be brief as I know that time is running out. I remain deeply concerned about the obsession about the need for a single voice in Europe, which seems to come up in the legal affairs working group and elsewhere. I cannot understand why democrats do not want power to be dispersed in the EU, rather than concentrated more and more in a single voice. Even if formal power is not given to that single voice, the media and world of influence and information will give enormous power to it. It is much better for the Convention to concentrate on how to disperse power. That is the essence of the American constitution, which is continually referred to. I am horrified by the suggestion, which was raised by my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Friend the Member for Wells, that the Convention may lead to the collapse of the three pillars into a single, out-of-date, hierarchical structure. He may be right, but we should fight against that with all our energies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Co-decision has not been mentioned, and I wonder whether it has been raised at the Convention. It is an obscure and secretive process that is not working in the way that it should. It is called conciliation by some, which is a misnomer, and it should be opened up in the name of democracy when examining the reallocation of powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constitutional treaty is mentioned again and again. It is difficult to understand how it will deal with shared and changing competences. Could we have an explanation, even if we do not agree with it thereafter? The essence of modern international relations is that the level at which issues are handled constantly changes. Agriculture and the environment are two examples. What was appropriate for central handling 20 years ago is not appropriate now. What is appropriate for one level 20 years ago must now be handled at regional, national and supranational levels as well. How will the constitutional treaty define competences if they are constantly changing? I am nervous that we will trap ourselves in a rigid pattern of constitutional law, which will be a paradise for lawyers and no one else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples) mentioned the charter of fundamental rights. It seems that we been have sold a pass on that—it is incorporated. Will our representatives remind their colleagues on the Convention that over-emphasis on positive rights is an intrusion on other people's liberties? One cannot go round demanding more and more rights without finding lobbies and groups demanding that certain things be prohibited, that people should have such rights and that other liberties should thereby be curtailed. That is dangerous and will lead to much bitterness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the language is still wrong. There is too much condescending language in the reports about how national Parliaments should be brought into the EU process as an afterthought or add-on. It should in fact be the other way round: EU institutions must be bought into the democratic and national parliamentary processes. Until we begin using that language to express our aims, we shall continue to see things slide away from the democratic, representative and dispersed pattern of power for which we should be fighting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Stoddart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to be brief. It is a privilege to be able to contribute to the debate, and to ask
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
questions about representatives and deputy representatives on the Convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Convention was ostensibly set up to deal with the problems of absorbing another 10 members. In my experience, which has been long in matters European, whenever the Community has been enlarged, it has been centralised. In order to make a success of absorbing another 10 members, however, it is not necessary to centralise—it is necessary to decentralise. I have read reports from our representatives and others, and it seems that the Convention is grinding on again towards centralism, rather than decentralisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me and confirms my fears is the fact that many people want a single legal personality. There is no question about it: if that comes about, the competences of the centre will expand. They will expand further into foreign policy—we are already hearing about a secretary of state and a place on the United Nations. There is also the difficult question of defence. There is movement towards a centralised European defence force. Home affairs, policing and judicial matters are being increasingly encroached on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the wrong way to go. If we are going to have a successful European community, it needs to be decentralised, and understood by and responsible to the people who are part of it. That means the national Parliaments, whose powers, far from being diminished, ought to be considerably increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angus Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must put on record my thanks to the members of the UK parliamentary team taking part in the Convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my comments to the notion of decentralisation, which seems to stop at the level of the member state. I have already mentioned that the UK team and other members of the Committee will be aware of the serious disappointment in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that those Parliaments and assemblies do not have direct representation on the UK delegation. Some members of the Committee may not understand why that is so. Consider the powers devolved, such as agriculture, fisheries, justice, environment and transport. They are all matters devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so this House has no role or say in them whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of such representation in the UK parliamentary delegation on the Convention therefore seems a curiosity. Plenty of interest in the subject had been articulated in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which explains the great disappointment that so little of what many people, including the Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell, had hoped would come out of the Convention is coming to pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disappointing that the so-called constitutional regions have been played down in the formation and output of the Convention's working groups, and that the claims of a grand new place for Scotland in the new EU are unlikely to be fulfilled. For the sake of scrutiny and transparency, I would like to repeat some questions that I asked earlier, to which I did not receive a direct answer. Have either of the UK's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
parliamentary representatives—full members—argued for enhanced scrutiny powers at a sub-state level during the proceedings of the Convention so far? Have either of them argued for the likes of Scotland to have direct access to the European Court of Justice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the moves in the Convention to reform the Council. I do not agree with the right hon. Member for Wells, who claimed that there was political consensus in the UK against a constitution. I speak as a representative of the main opposition party in Scotland. We have always been in favour of a constitution. We would welcome it, whether in the form of a treaty or a full constitutional setting within the EU. We are in favour of the incorporation of the charter of fundamental rights, and we welcome the mechanism to return powers. The news today on the state of the fishing industry in Scotland, with the possibility of up to 20,000 job losses, makes that imperative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Wells painted an interesting picture when he said that the only people not getting more powers were the electorate. So far as I can see it—so far as Scotland is concerned—the only people not getting more powers from the Convention process are those elected by the people to represent them in the key areas with shared sovereignty. He said that national parliamentarians were not even on the pitch. Those elected in Scotland who deal with matters of shared sovereignty are not even in the stadium, let alone next to the pitch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the members of the UK delegation well, but I hope that they will do their best not to forget the interests of parts of the European Union—throughout it, but including Scotland—whose Governments are closer to the people than those of the member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to repeat the previous speaker's worries on Scotland, but I will make only one remark on them. As he knows, the Select Committee on European Scrutiny, on which we both serve, has made several recommendations on how the problem should be dealt with. The Leader of the House will give evidence to the Committee. We should discuss the relationship with UK Ministers rather than Convention representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse everything that the Chairman of that Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Clydesdale, said on our disappointment about the recommendations on considering subsidiarity and the role of national Parliaments together, which we thought reasonable. That would have been a forward-looking vision, rather than the old vision of clawing back powers and rolling back the tide of the European Union that I have heard from Opposition Members in the past couple of hours. It reminded me of a film I once saw called "Curse of the Living Dead". I thought that we were being haunted by creatures from the abyss, rather than looking forward to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our proposal, we had reasonable expectations that a national Parliament, when it discussed subsidiarity, would be given the ability to wave a red flag. As our Chairman said, it should be able to bite as
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
well as bark, though in a positive and supportive way. It could say, "You're wasting European Union time in trying to reach a pan-European conclusion on the issue, which would be much better dealt with by a national Parliament." I come from a place where devolution is ongoing rather than finished, and relationships are still to be worked out between the devolved assemblies and Parliaments in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some legitimate concerns about the Commission's entering areas that it should not enter. It proposed a budget for Europol, for example. That was a justice and home affairs matter that it wanted to include in its budget and take away from the joint competences of the Parliaments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish with a few words on the report of the European youth convention. I have spoken to some of its members, and I was impressed by the fact that they were looking to the future, not the past. That future could be frightening to some hon. Members. The report says, for example:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After a single market and the euro, it will be time to create a European cultural framework."</p></blockquote>
The debates that we are having now are practically debates of the past, because the Convention is looking to a time in the future when there will be a single European view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon might be shocked by the fact that the Convention wants a charter of fundamental rights to be the first chapter of a new European constitution. The youth do not have a fear of a united European view or see it as undermining national identity. They see the two things as being fundamentally united, supportive of each other and complementary, in a way in which even I had not thought of. That is the way in which youth see things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman really not see a danger in the charter of fundamental rights being justiciable as part of the treaty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like everything else, the relationship between the European Union and national Parliaments must be worked out on the basis of negotiation. However, the vision of youth is that that is not a barrier but fundamental to the purpose of unity in the European Union. Their vision is different from ours, in that they are talking not about the old worry of wars to come but about a brighter future to be built together. Their view has much to recommend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we think of our task not as holding on to what we do not want to lose but delivering what youth want to see delivered, we might get on a lot better. We should consider whether the European Union should be given legal personality, for example, because they see that as part of the future that they want to live in. We must not write the new constitution in such hard terms that it is incapable of further revision, because the youth want to see more on the agenda than we are currently discussing. I hope that we can deliver that for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Euro train is still rushing through the night, and is clearly going to the terminus in the Euro state. I would like to think that our representatives might cast a few of those British leaves on the line to slow it down a little and make the journey more attractive. Let me suggest, in the two minutes remaining to me, the kind of things that we should do to make the process a little more democratic, fairer and more connected to the realities of our constituents and our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, member states should have the right to propose repeal of European legislation so that we can get some of it off the statute book. Secondly, we should ask for a transfer of competence over important matters such as fishing and farming. The common policies have done enormous damage in our country and it would be much better if those matters were back under British democratic control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, if the Community already has legal personality, it does not need a new convention or treaty to establish it. If it does not have such a legal personality, it is very undesirable that it should. We should reverse the Morton's fork that we have been given this evening—the suggestion that because it has it, it should be given it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point is that we should ask that legitimacy come democratically from member states. Many more things should be done by intergovernmental agreement rather than Commission decisions behind closed doors. Fifthly, we should say that when the Community legislates on behalf of the Community—which I hope that it will do less frequently than it has done—it should do so in the open, before the press and the public, and with someone present who is charged with the task of opposing the proposals democratically. At present, everything is legislated behind closed doors, with no formal opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remind people that we need to have national power and control over the big issues, because if one does not have that one has no legitimacy, with the result that, when something goes badly wrong, it will fracture the Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an immensely desirable debate, and I am sure that I speak for all my colleagues in saying how much we value the meetings of the Committee. Various views have been expressed that have kept us on our toes, which is essentially what the process is for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to several concerns that were expressed by Lord Howell. He spoke about the growing accretion of law under the acquis communautaire. That matter needs to be addressed in ways that would be familiar in the United Kingdom Parliament. Part of the work might be dealt with by consolidation, because some of the legislation is, in a sense, overlapping and needs to be tidied up. Some of the legislation needs to be dealt with in the way that we seek to reform our domestic law: through Law Commission recommendations on areas in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
technical changes can best be made. Those are the sort of processes that I believe could amplify the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether law should be repealed or simply fall into desuetude should also be faced; a lot of law has fallen effectively into desuetude, as has quite a lot of our own domestic law. Lord Howell spoke about the thrust to decentralise and he was not the only person who did. I think that that ducks the issue—one that I believe that the Convention has to face—that the effectiveness of member states has been tested and found wanting in many of the areas in which the European Union has been granted a competence. Simply redistributing powers in the relevant areas back to member states would be, in a sense, to admit defeat. I am bound to say that I do not think that that is a sensible approach. I think that the reality is that the European Union—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the noble Lord point to any aspect on which the EU has shown its ability to control money, spend it wisely and deliver a good result for Britain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I could without a great deal of difficulty. The control of the structural funds, in so far as this country has been concerned with that matter, has been extremely beneficial to some of the more depressed regions. There is a need to consider what should and should not be done in Europe. That is at the heart of the Convention, which is why there is a trade-off between a proper constitutional settlement that sets out, as clearly as may be, the shared competences, and one that abandons the notion that we are on an escalator with ever-closer union as a rather frightening goal. That prospect is frightening because it is uncertain and because to do that would clearly go beyond the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality to which we are attached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My single emphasis, which I recognise is not that of every member of the Committee, is that there is a need to empower Europe to be effective and to democratise the use of that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Tomlinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to respond briefly to points raised in the debate. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon produced an interesting list. I should like to tell him and my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly that the shorthand language of collapsing the pillar structure should not, in the context of the Convention, be regarded as synonymous with the abolition of intergovernmentalism. Any detailed examination of the totality of papers reveals that. If it were synonymous, I would share those hon. Members' concerns, but it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord Howell spoke about his fears on competences. Although the outcome of the deliberations of the working group on competences—the report—may not fully satisfy the right hon. Member for Wells, I am sure that Lord Howell would find the result profoundly more satisfactory in many respects than the present position.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
The noble Lord Howell and my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly mentioned COSAC. I am always worried when I hear talk about reforming it, especially when qualified majority voting is mentioned as a means of securing decisions. My question is, who on earth is COSAC supposed to influence in respect of decisions? Does it have a role in collective scrutiny? I believe not, so I am not worried about whether it takes decisions. It should be talking shop, so I would prefer to address its abolition rather than reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the noble Lord Stoddart that we need to reflect more about Laeken. He spoke about enlargement, but the Laeken declaration was not about that. It was intended to ensure that those involved in the process of enlargement would also be involved in the process of deliberation on the creation of a new treaty with such major new objectives as better connecting Europe with the citizen and with member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson), but I covered his main points earlier. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon spoke about subsidiarity. The key need is to respond to what he criticised—the judicial interpretation—and to make the interpretation of subsidiarity a much more political and less legal question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On the charter of fundamental rights, surely we all agree that it is crucial to avoid competing sources of jurisprudence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, it was interesting to hear such a diversity of parliamentary views. However, as a member of the Convention, I would welcome a more formalised structure for parliamentary views to be put to it, which would make it easier to say with clarity and certainty, "These are the views held by national Parliaments." That is a deficiency at present, but the Convention itself cannot be held responsible for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already mentioned my agreement with the hon. Members for Clydesdale and for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) on the inadequacy of the proposals for empowering national Parliaments. We all need collectively to work harder to resolve that. The sheer volume of legislation presents a systemic problem for scrutiny committees. Thus far, however, the proposals do not even offset moves in the other direction—moving more competences upwards to the European Union, particularly in respect of foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. I know from my working group that there will be proposals to transfer more powers to the Community level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the wise words of my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon. He was partly supported by the hon. Member for Caerphilly, who expressed concerns about a
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
wholesale communalisation of these sensitive areas. Doubtless, Governments will say that they have certain safeguards to preserve the intergovernmental nature of some of the policies—in other words to salvage something of the pillared structure, even if it all goes into a single format. However, that is largely wishful thinking; under the Amsterdam treaty, much of the justice and home affairs pillar, particularly asylum and immigration policy, was transferred to the first pillar. The safeguards are being eroded. There is a shared right of initiative between the Commission and member states over these matters of policy, but only for the first five years, so it is almost certain that once these decisions are taken in the first pillar under the Community pillar, all the intergovernmental safeguards will gradually be eroded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing particularly with criminal justice matters and with foreign affairs—sensitive political issues that go to the heart of what a nation state is about. We are dealing with the coercive power of the state over voters. Therefore, matters of control, of scrutiny and of accountability are very difficult to judge; we do not even get them right in our own country. The police make mistakes, judges make mistakes, courts make mistakes, but because we have a sense of ownership of our criminal justice system and we feel that we can correct it, the victims, or those who are at the receiving end of mistakes, nevertheless assent to the general structure. All that will go when it is communalised and taken up to the most remote tier of government known to us: European Government level. That is why the sense of alienation will get worse if we transfer these matters to the centre. I hesitate to disagree with my colleagues, all of whom are agreeable; I have far too many arguments with foreign members of the Convention without wishing to dispute with my hon. Friends. However, I must part company with the noble Lord Maclennan on that point.

On Lord Stoddart's point, enlargement is in trouble because Germany is no longer the economic motor of Europe or the paymaster. All previous enlargements have been paid for by German contributions. The German economic miracle is over. Germany is now the victim of the growth and stability pact—what the President of the European Commission calls "the stupid pact". Europe has run out of money to bankroll the system. If I understand the noble Lord's point, when bureaucrat systems get into trouble, as I think they will over enlargement or its aftermath, they usually use it as an opportunity further to centralise controls rather than to disperse them democratically.

that pillar away and make a European criminal jurisdiction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is right. We saw how the press treated the issue of the plane-spotters in Greece. Such things will become an almost weekly occurrence if British citizens are extradited for crimes that are not necessarily crimes in this country. That makes my point about the sense of remoteness and alienation, which will be compounded if we communalise these sensitive issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who has listened to the debate so far will agree that the views in the House are varied, as are those of the representatives here. I hope that any Member of either House will find that at least one of us will represent their view. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the right hon. Member for Wokingham that I not only occasionally scatter British leaves on the track, but I scatter them with the best native Bavarian accent, which is even more effective. Fears about the train may be unfounded. We have had much discussion about the collapsing of the pillar structure, along with demands that we speak in a language that will be understood outside the Committee. I assure hon. Members that if anybody outside listened to us they would think that there had been a small earthquake in Athens, rather than understanding the real meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real meaning is that, on occasions, the method of decision taking is intergovernmental. A clear distinction will emerge from the Convention on how decisions can be taken, and which areas will be subject to which decision-taking processes. The Convention is not full of rabid federalists. That was rather to my surprise, as I was expecting to find more. The federalists are as much in a minority as the total intergovernmentalists. The majority view is that we need to rationalise the process of decision taking. Hardly anyone suggests that areas such as defence or crime should be anything other than intergovernmental. Although that will be proposed by some, it does not reflect the main view.

	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lilley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised. It says a large majority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want this House to give a bad example to our colleagues from the other place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Stuart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a debate about large and small, and left and right. There is a real tension in ensuring that we respect the interests of the small countries as much as those of the large ones. However, we must not reach a point at which one small country can hold up the whole process; nor must we create an a la carte Europe, which would be equally divisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of regions was raised. We in the Convention are keen to ensure that the mechanisms of regional devolution in each country are effective. We do not think that it would be right for the Convention to tell the Spaniards how to deal with Catalan, the Germans how to deal with the Lander, or the UK what its relationship with Scotland should be. Those decisions must be devolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall respond to the criticism that subsidiarity is not strong enough. I do not want to create a system in which individual national Parliaments have a right to veto Commission proposals. We are, quite rightly, represented by our Governments. However, if a third of the Parliaments were to say, for example, "Hold on, that really should not be done at that level", that collective view would force the Commission to reconsider. That is hugely significant. I wish that hon. Members would appreciate what a huge change in the EU architecture that represents. For the first time, national Parliaments will have a voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are represented by our Governments. The biggest change is to access to information, so that Parliaments can carry out scrutiny in a politically effective way. When we considered the various systems, we found that all of them, on balance, could do better. There is a huge amount of information available to assist in exerting political influence on Governments, and that needs to be available earlier. I urge hon. Members to consider that, and to recognise what a huge change that is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
