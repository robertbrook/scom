<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As this is the first sitting of the Standing Committee on the Convention, I shall explain the procedure that must be followed. The Committee has up to one and a half hours to hear statements from parliamentary representatives and the alternate representatives, and to put questions to them. There will then be a debate on the motion. If the sitting has not previously concluded, I shall put the Question on that motion when members of the Committee have sat for two and a half hours. In addition to members of the Committee, other Members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords may ask questions and/or participate in the debate. I know that many will wish to take part, and I hope that questions and contributions to the debate will be brief so that as many Members of both Houses as possible can participate.</span></p>
<p>7.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Gisela Stuart <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Edgbaston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook. I thank the House authorities for making the sitting possible, so that parliamentary representatives can report back to both Houses of Parliament. I shall limit my statement and concentrate on the working group on the role of national Parliaments, which I chair. I thought that the Committee should have its first sitting before the recess, because my working group will report before the House returns in October and it is important that it receives input from both Houses of Parliament before then.<br><br>
The working group on the role of national Parliaments was in the first wave of working groups to be set up: it was one of the first six. There was considerable opposition from some members of the Convention to a working group on national Parliaments. At the extreme end of the argument, it was said that national Parliaments are represented in the European Union architecture by national Governments. It became clear in our discussions that there are different perceptions about whether a Parliament, as an institution, has a right to be represented and defended, as distinct from Governments. Mechanisms in other member states for holding Governments to account within European Union institutions look persuasive and powerful on paper, but because they can be triggered only by the majority party—the Government—they do not give Parliament itself a role. It was even suggested to us that Governments use the scrutiny reserve for their own means.<br><br>
The working group has 30 members, most of whom are national parliamentarians. A Commissioner is a member of the group as are some Members of the European Parliament. There is overlap between the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
working group on the role of national Parliaments and a specific working group that was set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Mendez de Vigo to consider only the narrow remit of subsidiarity. The working group on the role of national Parliaments has had its first two meetings. It will hold a meeting on Thursday, and there will be a joint meeting with the subsidiarity group on the Wednesday before we finish for the August break and return in September. At our first sitting, we considered our mandate. To my surprise, unlike almost all other working groups that spend the majority of their first sitting arguing about the framing of their mandates, ours was agreed within five minutes.<br><br>
We then had a round-the-table discussion on the role of national Parliaments. There was an educational element to that discussion, because a curious aspect of the working of the Convention is that almost half its members have no first-hand experience of the workings of the European Union. It is slightly difficult for them to voice their opinion on the operation of the EU and how it could be improved when their experience is theoretical. The exchange of ideas in the first session was extremely useful and taught me, as chairman, that if one does not give too much warning of the choice of subject, people will not come with prepared statements and positions, and there may be a genuine exchange of ideas.<br><br>
The second session was in two parts. In one we heard a presentation by a German academic called Maurer, who had done extensive research on various systems of parliamentary scrutiny. We used his document as evidence for the working group. He gave a similar presentation in the afternoon to the subsidiarity group, so that both groups had a similar knowledge base from which to work. We also submitted several questions to the Commission, because we wanted to get a sense of how it applies the principle of subsidiarity. Commissioner Barnier gave us a brief summary.<br><br>
We asked the Commission—and are in the process of asking the European Council and European Parliament—specific questions about how it applies the principle of subsidiarity; to what extent subsidiarity is observed; whether the Amsterdam protocol has been sufficiently achieved; and to what extent it could be improved. We then drew a slightly premature conclusion—in the logical sequence of the working group—to the evidence taken on practice, because we needed to prepare a clear position for the subsidiarity meeting.<br><br>
The next meeting will consider aspects of subsidiarity, such as the extent to which national Parliaments should have a role in deciding on subsidiarity. Some people argue that the problem is not so much subsidiarity as transposition and, at times, proportionality. There was certainly a push from the MEPs in the group that national Parliaments should have a role. Personally, I have my doubts about whether that would be the right way forward.<br><br>
We also considered the mechanisms and whether we should have new institutions. Before we set up the working group, we had a full Convention session on the role of national Parliaments, and the preliminary and the evidence sessions have shown that we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0617">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
considerable doubts as to whether a new institution is really the solution. Rather than creating such new institutions and making the decision-making process even more complicated, the present position requires strengthening and simplification.<br><br>
In the autumn, under the working programme, we shall invite our Scandinavian colleagues to give a presentation on how their scrutiny system works. We will also ask some of our French colleagues to put forward their ideas, which revolve around a second Chamber. I have planned a visit to Finland on either 20 or 27 September to see first hand how the Finnish model works. I have also agreed to go to the Friday session of the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees.<br><br>
Although we hope to bring our work to a conclusion in October, I think that it would be inappropriate to conclude our findings before COSAC has an opportunity to put forward its ideas. However, the group on subsidiarity will finish its meetings in September. As for the rest of the working groups, those dealing with subsidiarity and whether the EU should have a legal personality will report in September. The group that is considering whether the charter of human rights should be incorporated will report in September or early October. President Giscard d'Estaing announced at the last session that he hoped that by mid-October to be able to outline how the output of the Convention will be used. He encouraged us not to. call it a skeleton, but to come up with something that sounded more dynamic.<br><br>
The group on what is inelegantly called complementary competences, which considers the use of article 308 and examines whether the European Union can act when it does not have a specific treaty mandate, the group on economic governance and the group on the role of national Parliaments will report in October or early November.<br><br>
The setting up of a second wave of working groups has been announced. They will start work in September, and we hope to agree on their remit at the praesidium meeting this Thursday. There will be groups on the EU and its external relations, defence, the simplification of the instruments of the EU and justice and home affairs for greater security. There have been requests for two more working groups that we have not been able to agree to at this stage—on the regional implications of the EU and on good governance, which does not only mean economic governance.</span></p>
<p>7.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wells)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Convention has been sitting for nearly five months. It is starting to grapple with matters of substance, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) said. Working groups have been established, one of which I served on and to which I shall allude in a moment.<br><br>
I hope that the Convention will start to make the necessary hard choices. To date, there has been a slight tendency to reel off generalised demands, usually for more powers for everyone. All the existing institutions and vested interests have made eloquent cases for more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
powers for themselves. The European Commission wants more powers in the field of foreign policy, security, economic co-ordination and even taxation. The European Parliament wants more powers. Most member states want to retain a degree of intergovernmental decision-making. Therefore, the Council of Ministers must retain or extend its status. There is also a general agreement that the Parliaments of member states must be brought more into decision-making. That cannot all happen at once. Something must give and choices are necessary.<br><br>
I arrived at the Convention concerned about the democratic deficit. After five months I am truly alarmed, partly because I do not think that the matter is being addressed seriously enough. There are certain basic requirements for any system of government. Decisions should be taken by people who are visibly accountable. It is also important that the people affected by those decisions—the public—should know what is going on and should be able to influence the outcome by making representations. Indeed, in extreme cases when enough people disagree, they must be able to change the direction of policy and remove the people responsible.<br><br>
In a more general sense, the public should feel a sense of ownership of the system—a sense of belonging or allegiance. In other words, a demos must exist. All that is absent in the European Union. The more I delve into it, the more I find the system almost comically undemocratic, which is extremely dangerous. I offer one small example, because it can often illustrate a greater truth. I investigated the genesis and course of the physical agents vibration directive. That is a matter of concern in my constituency because it would limit the exposure of employees to vibrating machinery. That includes all-body exposure, such as sitting on tractors, so it is colloquially known as the tractor directive. It was negotiated and passed by an opaque procedure and by negotiation between a specialist committee of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The Scrutiny Committee examined it in 2000 and deemed that it was politically important. However, it was not debated. It is now a directive and will be enforceable, presumably with the force of criminal law, on those whom we represent.<br><br>
I cited the directive at a recent public meeting in Denmark as an example of over-regulation. A Danish Member of the European Parliament said that I was spreading baseless rumours and that the directive does not apply to agriculture. I accepted that at the time, but I checked with the House of Commons Library on my return and found that it will apply to agriculture after a transitional period. I exchanged e-mails with the MEP and she conceded that it would apply. She was the rapporteur of the relevant committee. How can the public understand what is happening if the rapporteur on the relevant committee does not? I call that a complete denial of the principle of self-government.<br><br>
The system needs radical reform and the Convention is the last chance. The solution is quite simple: we should recognise that the nation state remains the focus of people's democratic allegiance.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0618">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
National Parliaments must stop being passive receptacles of directives and regulations. We stand under the waterfall of the measures that come before us. Instead, we must insert national Parliaments of all member states into the decision-making process at the start.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are no interventions on the statements. Questions come afterwards, and the debate will follow them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I am as anxious as you to listen to the debate, Mr. Cook.<br><br>
My solution is to bring national Parliaments truly into the debate at the start. That would change the nature of other institutions in turn. The Commission would cease to be a proto-government, or at least to have a monopoly on initiative, and would become a secretariat to what national Parliaments and the European Parliament collectively want at European Union level.<br><br>
I turn to the working group of which I am a member. It addresses the question of where competences or powers should reside. Existing powers should be returned to national Parliaments unless they can be explicitly defined as matters that can be carried out only at European level, such as cross-border issues and trade matters. They must not be defined by reference to objects, but to subject matter, because reference to desirable objects, such as completion of the single market, has been used as justification for practically any action. The notorious articles 94 and 308 are both used to justify regulations and directives for which there is no treaty competence elsewhere. The working group meets again tomorrow. I shall attend it in order to continue that task.</span></p>
<p>7.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan of Rogart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be evident during questions, if it is not evident already, that the Members who are representing what they see as the interests of this Parliament and their country do not have identical views or co-ordinated positions, and that nor do we operate within the Convention in the defence of a pre-identified mandate. Consequently, the perceptions of those of us who have attended the Convention from the beginning may be thought to be descriptive of rather different happenings; I suspect that that has less to do with the functioning of the Convention than with the angle of vision of the observers.<br><br>
During the initial meetings—the plenary sessions—a historic gathering of people with very varied experience of the operation of the Union, some of whom come from the candidate countries, has been coming together to engage, to form judgments about each other, and to test whether those participating in the debate do so with good will and in good faith because they are seeking to strengthen the objectives of the Union and the effectiveness of its democratic accountability. With such a diverse galère of people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
present, it is scarcely surprising that it took some time to get down to brass tacks. However, I believe that those initial meetings were valuable; they established some degree of confidence that there is a purposive intent not merely to reform the institutions of the Union to enable enlargement without constitutional disruption, but to seek to answer some of the criticisms about the operation of the Union that are widespread in many member countries.<br><br>
It is generally felt that the president, Giscard D'Estaing, having sat throughout each session for up to six hours at a time, listening carefully to what was going on, and then, perhaps, at the end or on the following day, delivering himself of utterances which, though bringing his personal view to bear, reflected that he had been closely following the debate, has engendered some confidence in the direction and leadership of the Convention. That has been fortified by the work of the two vice-chairmen, Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene and Mr. Guiliano Amato, as well as by the work of the praesidium, which has been available for questioning both collectively in plenary sessions and at meetings of the national parliamentarians. There have been several examples of the processes being adapted to take account of suggestions made by rank and file members and alternates, such as myself.<br><br>
The Convention is working well. It is a large body, which has to work on the detail in sub-committees—or working groups, as they are called—in order to produce responses of the kind that I have suggested that it sees itself as being in the business of producing. At the beginning, some criticism was voiced at the plenary session that the focus was not immediately on restructuring the institutions of the Union, but rather on an analysis of what the Union's functions should properly be in the world in which we now live, which is different from that of 50 years ago, when the basic institutions were set up.<br><br>
I have given a more general and rather more optimistic report than that delivered by Mr. Heathcoat-Amory, whose substitute I am. I am sure that it was not a surprise to him—although it may have been to the plenary session last Thursday—that when I took his place the views that I expressed were not those that he would express. However, that is the nature of the Convention.<br><br>
If it is possible to criticise the legislative outcome of the European Union—I do not doubt that many examples could be offered of faulty, defective measures that have an effect that was unseen in advance by those responsible both nominally and actually for the legislation—that is no peculiarity of European legislation. The finger can be pointed at many products of the Parliament of which we have been Members as similarly defective legislation. I hope that I shall not be thought partisan if I mention the Dangerous Dogs Act 1989.<br><br>
It is none the less right to try to identify ways of improving institutionally and tackling the Union's remit. I have not noticed at this stage—I believe that the pattern has been set—any demand to alter significantly the Union's competencies. There is a broad consensus about that. On the areas of policy tackled in the Union's institutions, whether in the field
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0619">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
of trade and commerce and the single market—the preoccupation of the Communities under the original treaty—justice and home affairs competencies exercised in respect of cross-border crime, for example, or the field of common security and defence, I have detected no desire on the part of the Convention to depart from those broad remits and greatly to add to or detract from them.<br><br>
I have heard a suggestion that consideration should be given to repatriation when possible, but when examples have been sought, they have been few. One Convention member suggested that education was such an example. A French socialist, Olivier Duhamel, pointed out that the Community has little responsibility in that sphere and asked whether it was seriously being suggested that the Erasmus programme should be scrapped. The answer was yes. That concrete suggestion aroused neither a round of applause nor, indeed, any enthusiasm. I have not yet heard a suggestion for repatriation powers that commanded an obvious ripple of assent. It is too early, in my judgment, to be sure how effective that would be as a method of reforming the constitution of an organisation such as the European Union.<br><br>
The work of the working group on which I have served, on legal personality—which, although it may be thought arcane and specialised, has none the less substantial implications for the Union's treaty-making activities—demonstrates high seriousness in and commitment to the task on the part of those participating. They have taken evidence from lawyers in the Commission, in the Parliament and in the Council. Before attempting to reach a view, they sought outside academic evidence and the evidence of lawyers commending themselves to national Governments. I think that that is a responsible approach. More than that, at this stage, I feel I cannot say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have until 9 pm if need be for questions to the representatives, but I must remind Members that questions should be brief, pertinent and asked one at a time. Each representative may offer a response to those questions, should they so wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Hood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydesdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a special day, the first time that we have had a Standing Committee of this kind. Earlier, I met the Prime Minister in a Select Committee for the first time, so the work that we have had in Committee today is quite interesting.<br><br>
I am interested in being here, and particularly interested in a comment that Gisela made about COSAC. We have seen the response that the setting up of a working group on the role of national Parliaments had in certain quarters of the European Parliament. My hon. Friend made the point that COSAC has its flaws, if it is to be considered as a substitute for a second chamber. As a member of COSAC and probably the father of that distinguished body, having been a member of it for 10 years, I hope that no one is even considering making it into a second chamber.<br><br>
Can my hon. Friend tell me whether her working group is considering examining COSAC and coming up with recommendations to make it more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
representative of national Parliaments by following the lines that she suggested? Our suggestion for the reform of COSAC was to take representatives from the European Parliament out of COSAC and out of the troika. Would that be something that her working group would consider? I should be interested to hear the responses of the working group on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before hearing the hon. Lady's response, I remind the Committee that the form of address here is not to be the Christian name, but the formal address, as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we are trying to do in the working group is to define first what should be done before going into much closer detail about who should do it. It is becoming quite clear that the question of subsidiarity mostly involves a political process before it involves a legal process. The question is whether only MPs and MEPs combined should be involved. Some doubts are arising as to whether a joint body means joint responsibility, or the divided application of responsibility.<br><br>
The three models being put on the table are a strengthened COSAC, a second chamber and a senate. I confess that one option that I hope the Committee will look at is to make the Commission not only present its proposals to the European Parliament but to come to national Parliaments, perhaps with an equivalent of the Queen's Speech, as in the British model, that can be debated. National Parliaments would then be able to say whether something was a breach of subsidiarity. The outcome of such debates will allow us to look at the appropriate role, or change in role, for COSAC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston a question that arises from the note, supplied to us in annexe D, from the praesidium, of which she is a member, to the convention on the subject of the role of national Parliaments in the European architecture. That matter is directly relevant to her group, of which she is chairman.<br><br>
The note asked how one could assist the national Parliaments to play their crucial role in ensuring the democratic legitimacy of Union action. The hon. Lady may know that the European Scrutiny Committee produced a report that concerns democracy, accountability and national Parliaments. Does she agree with the main content of that report? Does she accept that its determination to enhance the power of the national Parliaments, which would be inconsistent with the thrust of the arguments coming out of the convention so far, is a matter that as a national representative she would want to insist on in her own group? In other words, would the report enhance the role of democratic legitimacy by ensuring that national Parliaments are the bedrock of the process of parliamentary activity throughout the European Union?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention at the opening that we have formally tabled the report of the European Scrutiny Committee as an evidence paper to the working group. Copies were distributed to all members at one of our meetings. I personally agree
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0620">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
with much of what the Scrutiny Committee put forward, apart from the recommendation that we should return to first past the post, but that is quite a different subject.<br><br>
It is important to realise that our working group has to consider two debates on democratic legitimacy. The constitution of the United States says "we the people". The constitution of Germany says "we the Lander". Therefore, there are two lines of democratic legitimacy. One is the direct elected mandate of members and the other is the democratic legitimacy that would arise at the Council of Ministers as the representatives of another body. Those two models have to be accepted as legitimate. Our group was very much encouraged by the president, who, when he summed up the convention session on national Parliaments, challenged us to be quite assertive in ensuring that that role of the direct relevance of national Parliaments is one that we defend. I finish with something that one of the Italian delegates said: within the European Union architecture, Members of the European Parliament are very much the power without a face, and National Parliaments have been too long the face without power. I hope that we can reverse that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have gained a reputation for enabling as many as wish to speak to do so, and I should like that reputation to continue during this Committee, so I hope to have the briefest possible questions and answers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that, Mr. Cook, I shall cut out all of my qualifying clauses and move straight to the simple question. What is the view of our representatives of the likely options that will result at the end of this process in the spring of next year, prior to the debate before the intergovernmental conference? Is it assumed that several options will emerge, or in most cases will there be one majority and one minority view? What is the current prevailing wind in respect of the process?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My view is that President Giscard badly wants a single recommendation to go to the intergovernmental conference. It has already been called a constitutional treaty in order to commend itself to those who want a constitution, and to those who want a treaty but no constitution. I believe that that would be a mistake. We must come up with options, and the option to which I would like to contribute is a Europe of democracies. Such an option would be based more firmly on member status, and would allow enlargement to proceed more quickly and easily because we would not be asking those new and often small countries to surmount huge new hurdles such as taking on 85,000 pages of the acquis communautaire, which in the case of Malta will literally overwhelm its administrative systems. Let us try for a number of different outcomes, some of which it may even be appropriate to try out with the public through referendums.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall again offer a somewhat different vision. The Convention is convinced that it will have little effect if it simply advances a range of options for further debate. Its very purpose is to assist national Government leaders, who will consider the issues that they put to it at the Laeken conference, by offering choices and preferences and indicating the extent to which there is agreement. There will undoubtedly be those who do not agree with the thrust of any report that may be agreed by the majority, and the quality of their disagreements will no doubt be analysable as will the quality of the majority view. The wait to be attached will also depend on the size of the majority, but I have no doubt that it is not only President Giscard who seeks a single document but a substantial majority in the Convention.<br><br>
The document may be called one thing or another, but my guess is that at the end of the day it is not what it is called that will matter because if there are those who do not wish for any constitutional document they will not be satisfied by it being called a treaty if it is in fact a constitutional document. The outcome will probably be what has been referred to as a "chapeau" treaty, which will be a statement of broad principles that will involve changes and reform while not being a consolidating treaty. It is clearly beyond the capabilities of the Convention to seek to go into the small print of the very bulky documents that presently constitute the constitutions of the communities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Brabazon of Tara</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook. It is almost unique to have a Committee such as this to which Lords are allowed to contribute. I welcome that and I thank you, Mr. Cook, for allowing us to do so. I apologise if I get anybody's appellations wrong.<br><br>
I hope that the two delegates will take into account a couple of reports that the House of Lords European Union Committee, of which I am the Chairman, has recently produced. One covers the second chamber debate and one covers the provisional agreement, both of which are important in relation to the role of national Parliaments. Thank you, Mr. Cook, for allowing us to take part. Although we are not members of the Committee we are at least allowed to participate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very much so. The House of Lords report on the second chamber was decisive. It destroyed the case for a chamber of parliamentarians very effectively. More recently, the Select Committee under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood), produced a constructive report that covered the whole waterfront. It was a little timid in some respects because we should go in hard on the issue of democracy and the powers of national parliaments, but I agree with much of it. It is immensely helpful for us to be able to say that we have behind us a majority of parliamentarians, particularly when they come from other parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I want to add a general reassurance that, because the House has been far-sighted in setting up its Brussels office, we ensure that all the reports of both Houses are fed in. Many countries are beginning to realise that they should perhaps copy that.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When reading the various texts that come from Europe, I notice that the European Parliament seems averse to the Committee's work on the role of Parliaments. For example, the praesidium member, Klaus Hansch, said of the working group that it was a total mistake and had got off on the wrong foot. Has the Committee now found its feet and will the hon. Lady tell us where we have moved to? Are we wining allies in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a theory that, in politics, if people are being nice, one is not getting anywhere, so I think that we are getting somewhere. Some institutions felt threatened because national Parliaments were the first group. European parliamentarians had a common position on virtually everything even before we started. One of the conflicts that we must face is that many MEPs believe at this stage that their common position is almost part of the acquis of the convention. We have to remind them that that is the view of one quarter of those who constitute the convention, but we are getting somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. The MEPs are well organised and hunt as a pack in the European Parliament. We at national level do not know each other as well yet. MEPs who claim that they hold the key to the democratic deficit must face the inconvenient fact that the last two treaty changes have given the European Parliament substantially more powers, but fewer and fewer people vote for them. The figure has fallen below a quarter in this country and is below a half in other member states. They do not suffer from lack of power. That is not the solution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Stanley (Tonbridge and Mailing)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston whether the subsidiarity group has considered the possibility of making subsidiarity justiciable and that one way of implementing that is to give national Parliaments the ability to take the European Commission to court if it proceeded to implement a measure by way of an EU directive or regulation which a national Parliament felt, on grounds of subsidiarity, should be left to individual member states?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I only read the notes of the group; I am not a member of it. However there is a debate in both groups about what they refer to as ex-anti and ex-poste. When something has been put into a legal form and politicians have expressed their will in words, it becomes a legal decision. We are working hard to have a political process before those decisions are made and the debate in both groups on whether we should turn to the courts is a live one. My view is that subsidiarity in particular must be a political decision to a large extent and only at the very end should it be a legal position. That view is shared by many of my colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support that position. It is most important that the subsidiarity test is subject to a political process of decision, not a justiciable one, because the European Court of Justice is a European institution. In the United States, the Supreme Court has for two centuries gradually centralised powers to the federal Government, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
the same process is at work in the European Court of Justice through a process of judicial activism. The only example of a federal system that did not do that was Canada in the first half of the last century. Disputes about powers often resulted in powers going to provinces, not to the federal level, because the court was the Privy Council in London. As soon as a court sits at the centre of a federal system, it becomes a centralising institution. Therefore, I agree very strongly that the member states and member state Parliaments, particularly, must have strong, perhaps decisive input to the question of the workings of subsidiarity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wayne David <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As well as considering the minutiae of the European Union's decision-making process, has the convention given any consideration to the huge distance between the people of Europe and European Union institutions, and exactly how the two might be brought together so that there can be a consensus about Europe's future direction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The convention is extremely aware of that and regards it as one of its major tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I should alert the Committee to the fact that I am partially deaf. In order to ensure that the proceedings are conducted in a proper manner, I must hear what is being said. Therefore, please address comments through the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Cook.<br><br>
The Convention seeks to take account of the views of the public in its work so far as is practicable, but I have to say that it has not been wholly successful, because its resources are limited. Meetings with civil society have taken place, and it is possible to criticise them as not entirely representative of the full range of opinions in Europe. More importantly, the Convention is anxious to engage in those institutional arrangements that are, inevitably, a turn off for the public. Therefore, clarity and simplification are in the minds and in the remits of the working parties that are considering the detail.<br><br>
Perhaps even more fundamentally, when we come to consider institutional reform, there may be—I have heard it discussed at the margins, at least, of the Convention—a recognition that when people vote for parliamentarians in most national Parliaments, they anticipate that two things will flow from the casting of votes: that leaders will be thrown up who will have responsibility and that policies may be affected. Neither of those is demonstrably a consequence of votes in European elections, so thought may be given to how to connect the European Parliament, for which votes are cast, with the leadership of the European Union, whether, for example, by nominating the President of the Commission, perhaps subject to advice and consent of the Council of Ministers, or vice versa. Such debates are taking place because of the Convention's desire to grapple with the sense of distance between the decision-making process and the citizens of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The alienation of the public is at the heart of my concerns. It shows up in the low
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0622">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
turnout for European parliamentary elections and in referendum results. There have been three recent referendums on Europe: Switzerland said no to joining; the Danes said no to the euro; and Ireland said no to the Nice treaty. The public are either completely switched off from or delivering snubs to the European Union. They see a technocratic edifice run by a priest class of experts, and feel no part of it. Two plenary sessions ago—Lord Maclennan alluded to this—we supposedly talked to the public. In reality, we talked to lobby groups and discovered that many of them existed only because they were paid for out of the European Union's budget. Brussels was talking to Brussels, while pretending that is was talking to the public. That is a profound problem. The solution to it is to re-establish the whole system from the bottom in member states' Parliaments in which people can engage and see the results of their votes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Howell of Guildford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I endorse Lord Brabazon's thanks to you, Mr. Cook, and, through you, to the powers that be, for allowing us to come from the other place to participate.<br><br>
I have a short question for Ms Stuart, who made some fascinating comments on the possibility of visits by Commissioners to speak in this Parliament. Has it been suggested that there might be more than speaking, such as sharing views, shaping the agenda with national parliamentary members, and perhaps surrendering the monopoly on initiative that the Commission has had as a result of earlier treaties? That could allow some initiatives to begin at the grass roots in nation state capitals. Has anything of that kind been suggested? Was anything said about not only rejigging the way in which subsidiarity is decided, but about reconsidering the whole shallow and quite recent concept of subsidiarity, which never fully matured when it first emerged, and which does not meet the need to decentralise and transfer parts of powers to the lower and better level of the nation state?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to gain support for two ideas. I have been successful on the first, but singularly unsuccessful on the second—I shall not give up yet. The first idea is that an engagement between the Commission and the national Parliament could lead to something that might be described as a traffic-light system. If a Parliament said that a breach had taken place, the case would go back to the Commission and back to the drawing board. A proposal that was based on a treaty that required anonymity would require only one national Parliament; one that needed a qualified majority would require several Parliaments. That issue has received lively debate, and when Commissioner Barnier gave evidence to the working group that I chair, I raised it.<br><br>
I keep putting the second idea on the table but no one will take it up. It is that rather than talk in precise detail about the redefinition of responsibility, we must come up with a mechanism that allows a two-way flow of competences. At the moment, there is only a one-way flow. Rather than allow the Convention to get bogged down, which it would if we reallocated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
responsibilities, it is extremely important to introduce a mechanism that allows movement both ways. The next step would be to decide who polices that. I am working on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Roger Casale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this important Committee, as I welcome the Convention. I am delighted that we have already heard from our representatives about the commitment that they will make to ensuring that the Convention has a successful outcome. It may be early days, but does my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston believe that if the outcome of the convention is successful, the exercise could be repeated? After all, part of the point of having a mandate is to seek to extend it. Does she believe that the Convention should be run on a permanent basis?</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that ten Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and ten Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should make the point that when we come to questions and answers, and more especially to debate, it will be much easier for me to recognise anyone seeking to catch my eye if they present something to me other than their posterior.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I received advice from the Clerk of the Foreign Affairs Committee that the quorum for the Committee is 10, and I made a count before walking out on the basis of that advice. I would be grateful for your guidance, Mr. Cook.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The quorum is 10, as stated on the Committee list. That means seven Committee members, plus two delegates and the Chairman. Peers are allowed to visit, bless them. They are more than welcome to participate, but they do not count towards the quorum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Roger Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That puts the rest of my question in a nutshell. Do our other representatives believe that the Convention could be made permanent if it is successful, or would they say from the outset that it is just a one-off?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Roger Casale) for his report on national Parliaments, which I read. It contains some useful ideas, especially on benchmarking.<br><br>
On the future of the Convention, all my instincts tell me to be extremely suspicious of any body, when the first thing that it wants to do is to continue to meet. The charter has been successful, as I hope that the Convention will be, but to try and make it permanent goes against all my instincts. All institutions should have a sell-by date. We resurrect them if we need them again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Casale asked for the views of other representatives. I strongly support the view expressed by Ms Stuart, perhaps for a slightly different reason. It seems to me that the purpose of the Convention is to reach a stable constitutional settlement that, by definition, will last. The very concept of re-establishing such a mechanism implies
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0623">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
that we have already despaired of reaching that happy equipoise. One aspect of the European Union gives rise to more anxiety than any other: the phrase in the constitutional document about ever closer union. I would be ready to trade that phrase for a genuinely satisfactory constitutional settlement that met the objections that are being raised, and stilled the anxiety about a process of creeping centralisation once and for all. Of course, that does not mean that some methods would not have to be incorporated in any settlement for amending provisions that were seen to be not working or not adequate to the new situations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Jim Dobbin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Heywood and Middleton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The word "subsidiarity" has been mentioned a few times tonight. During the deliberations of the group on the role of national Parliaments, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston is the chairman, was any consideration given to the engagement or involvement in the process of some sub-national authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We quickly reached the conclusion that how individual member states deal with sub-national legislative bodies is firmly up to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hodge Hill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston told us that MEPs hunt in packs. By contrast, Lord Maclennan said that there has been no attempt to coordinate the positions of our representatives at the Convention or to agree a common or defined national interest. Will she and the right hon. Member for Wells to tell us why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Convention meets and sits in alphabetical order. We are trying to break down the boundaries, but some groups hunt naturally as a pack and we must live with that. However, the UK delegation, including the MEPs, holds meetings, and our colleagues tell us that they regard the UK group as the most coherent and organised. Although we have different views on some topics, they feel that we represent the UK national interest, and our meetings strengthen that. Furthermore, it would not be good if we went with a closed mind, which would defeat the purpose of an open debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are inescapable personal differences between my colleagues and I, which is healthy. The Convention should be challenged and should examine radical ideas, which might be suppressed if we tried to unify artificially around a British position. However, it was a fair criticism in the Convention's early weeks that the British Government did not share information with us, and I felt and said that they should have done more. I was not even sent the written speeches of members from the Government after they had spoken, let alone before. Things have improved, and as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston said, we are invited to delegation meetings every time we go out. My working group also receives specialist advice from the Foreign Office. There are British interests, and we are reflecting them, but perhaps we should have done more, earlier.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to address a question specifically to Lord Maclennan, although I would be happy if anyone else wanted to chip in, on the legal personality of the Union, on which I have made a few pronouncements in the past few years. As I am sure that he knows, the European Commission just put out a communication that recommends simplification and merging of the treaties and giving the EU a legal personality and a constitutional treaty. Even more dangerously, it also proposes the fusion of the existing pillar structure of the EU.<br><br>
Having listened to the great experts, academics and lawyers, will Lord Maclennan spell out in simple language what conferring legal personality would involve? Does he accept that it would mean a single European voice, for example, in the common foreign and security policy and that, in combination with a constitutional treaty or arrangement, it would in effect be game, set and match for those, like himself, who believe in the federal project? No doubt he would encourage that, but could he tell me what he thinks the phrase "legal personality" means?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That invitation from a distinguished lawyer to give a simple answer is somewhat disingenuous. It is not a matter that can be answered simply. The lawyers' view, which has been universally expressed in evidence to the working group, is that although the European Union was not given legal personality by deliberate attribution when the treaties were signed, in contrast to the European Community treaties, which gave the EC legal personality, it has it nevertheless. All that flows from the failure to attribute legal personality is a degree of confusion among the partners with whom one is negotiating, in many cases in complex mixed agreements, part of which may refer to the subject matter of the EC, perhaps a trading matter, and part of which may refer to matters that fall within the Union. At root it is a matter of clarification, not of amendment of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Grenfell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join my colleagues from the Lords, who have now departed, in thanking you for having us here, Mr. Cook. Let me put this question to Ms Stuart. Is any consensus beginning to emerge on whether a statement of competences, be it in the form of a tidied-up treaty or a constitution, should spell out those areas that should be left to member states or those that should be reserved to the EU Commissioners? If it is the former, the list would seem endless, and if it is the latter, the treaty would have to be amended every time a competence was to be added. Neither seems to be terribly satisfactory. Is there a middle way? Is any consensus emerging on how the issue might be dealt with?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The prevailing consensus is that the presumption is that competences remain with the nation state unless they have been specifically given to the Union. In practice there are huge difficulties. On the question of legal personality, we have entire debates about whether something has already happened de facto, even though it is not enshrined in the article. That will be one of the big problems of the outcome of the Convention. If we come up with something that is deemed to be a new treaty, Nice,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0624">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
Amsterdam and previous treaties could unravel. Would total ratification be required? A whole range of leading questions have to be addressed. My firm view is that, with a few exceptions, the presumption is that the competence is with the nation state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This matter is under examination by a working group. Powers are supposed to rest at member state level unless they are defined in the treaty. That should be made more explicit. We should have something similar to one of the articles of the American Bill of Rights, which puts it beyond doubt that the default position is that the powers rest with states—in our case, member states—unless they are given to the central power.<br><br>
It follows that the powers or competencies to be exercised at Union level must be defined with great exactitude. That would put them beyond the reach of interpretation by the European Court of Justice, which as I said has a tendency to see things from a centralised perspective. That concept has met opposition in the Convention from people who say that it would deny flexibility, but I am afraid that we cannot have it both ways. If the public are to have confidence in the clarity and certainty of who does what, we must define the powers and competencies precisely, not as generalised objectives.<br><br>
To say, for instance, that the European Union will counter organised crime justifies pretty well any police or judicial activity. In the same way, in the policing of the single market, more or less any action to do with anything that can be moved across borders is justified. Therefore, the competencies must be spelled out in a treaty. If they are not referred to, they must be assumed to lie and to remain at state level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first part of my question is to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston to clarify the statement in which she referred to the question of a sub-member state body. An example is the Scottish Parliament, which has to legislate following European directives. The opinion was that that should be dealt with by the UK state. Is that the opinion of her working group or the formed opinion of the Convention?<br><br>
Secondly, I read that the chairman, Georges Katiforis, stated that there was no point in debating subsidiarity in relation to the environment. Is that his opinion on the environment only or in relation to everything? I notice that the European Parliament has said that if there were a judgment on questions of subsidiarity, it should be referred to the Court of Justice. Does the opinion of the Convention support that view, or the view of our European Scrutiny Committee that it should go to a body made up of politicians, not to the court?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, there is no such thing as opinions of the Convention. The whole point of the working group is to consider specific subjects and then put issues to the Convention as a whole. My comments on sub-national bodies with legislative power could best be described as a holding position, because I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
believe that we should deal with the processes of national Parliaments before we got into anything else.<br><br>
Greece, for example, does not have regions as such. We have an amazing mixture. The German system is extremely sophisticated. Its constitutional courts have consistently refused to give rulings on subsidiarity, saying that they are political decisions. I get the impression that member states would not react too well if the Convention tried to tell them what the relationship should be between their national Government and regional legislative bodies.<br><br>
As for Mr. Katiforis, I believe that colleagues must speak for themselves. I could ask for clarification, but it would not make sense not to debate subsidiarity. One question that we should consider is whether the European Court of Justice should look to a model that is analogous to our Attorney-General's references. Sometimes, when decisions that are made are not clear, we simply have to wait for further court decisions, rather than seek clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The convention is on the future of Europe, and many of us hope that, in 2004, the European Union will increase its membership by as many as 10 member states, so that we have a union of 25. I understand that representatives of the accession countries attend the Convention as observers. Has any attempt been made to obtain the views of those observer representatives?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The accession countries are present as full members and they take part in the working groups. It is impossible to detect any difference in the workings of the group, which even has a representative on the praesidium.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can add only that the views of those countries are eagerly sought. They can teach us a great deal about principles of government. Not long ago they were all run from Moscow, and at least some of them will not want to be run by another remote organisation, even though it is more democratic. Their views are important, but they have been rather shy in advancing them. They feel that they are negotiating to join an organisation, so they do not want to be too rude about it. Our point will be that they must sort things out before they join; it is their last chance, as it will be impossible once they have joined.<br><br>
I am worried about whether all the rules and regulations in the acquis communautaire will be implemented in those countries, and I am unsure that their judicial and criminal justice systems are up to scratch. Some of them are still supplying us with refugees—those deemed to be refugees under the appropriate conventions. By definition, therefore, some of those countries are ill treating their own citizens, yet they are negotiating to join. That problem should be overcome before the tape is finally cut.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Roger Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The central question that the Convention was set up to answer—it is a profound one—is how to bring European decision-making closer to the European citizen. If the answer is not to perpetuate the device of the Convention itself, it will become ever clearer that there is only one show in town—to enhance the role of national Parliaments. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
we can agree on that, I should like to ask our representatives how to advance the role of national Parliaments in the Convention. Could the argument be advanced on its merits, or would it be necessary to negotiate with other bodies represented in the Convention, such as national Governments? A move to increase the role of the Council of Ministers might provide an opportunity to advance the arguments for enhancing the role of national Parliaments as well. Can the arguments stand on their merits or will negotiation and horse trading with other institutions be necessary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I doubt whether it would be accepted that there is no means of strengthening the democratic accountability of the European Union other than by enlarging the role of national Parliaments. As to the precise means of doing so, I mentioned earlier the possibility of the European Parliament having a greater degree of control over the Executive than at present. That is one line of inquiry.<br><br>
National Parliaments can be given a more effective input in several ways, and Ms Stuart mentioned some of them. One possibility is that the European Union's programme as drafted by the Commission could be influenced by national Parliaments at an early stage before it is published annually in February. These ideas merit consideration in themselves, not as a substitute for alternative democratic strengthening of European institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it is impossible to democratise the other institutions. Conditions do not exist in Europe for a quasi-federal system, which is what we have. For example, elections for the President of the European Council would attract an embarrassingly low turnout. The election would not mean anything to people, and they would not know what the candidates stood for. People do not even vote in European Parliament elections for candidates from their own country who speak their language. The proposal for such an election would invite ridicule, which is why it is usually suggested that the election uses an indirect system.<br><br>
It is important to build on the essential democratic building block—member state Parliaments—by bringing some decisions back. Policy that should be decided at European Union level should be agreed collectively by national Parliaments by horizontal links and discussion. For example, the Kyoto accord was signed and clearly needs collective action. Member state Parliaments could agree and debate measures before regulations were drafted. It is all too late when we are at the receiving end of bafflingly complex regulations that mean nothing and have not really been debated in our own forum. That must change, and it could change. We could enter a mode of European discussion among member state Parliaments that is assisted by an expert secretariat, which I would call the commission. I would call the head of the commission the chief clerk of the commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that Klaus Hansch, the same gentleman whom I mentioned earlier, called for the charter of fundamental rights to be enshrined in the constitutional treaty of the European Union and made legally binding. That would extend the European
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
convention on human rights to a catalogue of social and economic rights, such as the right to reproduction and the right to housing. Is that gathering support in the Convention on the future of Europe, or is there the opposing view that the EU should accede to the European convention on human rights rather that incorporate the new fundamental treaty in the constitution?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the remit of one of the working groups. We should not forget that if that happened, Luxembourg would become the main court for human rights, which could undermine Strasbourg. That could be dangerous for countries in the east that turn to Strasbourg, because they are not part of the European Union. I would not want a diminution of our defence of human rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just want to emphasise that we are in danger of rights overload. They are easy to dispense and are all judiciable, but they can lead to curious conflicts of the various conventions. If we are moving toward a constitutional settlement in Europe, it should be noted that the most enduring constitutions, such as the American constitution, are essentially content neutral. They lay down who does what, how powers are controlled, what institutions do and how they are elected. However, they do not dispense endless rights such as rights to work, rights to housing and rights to education, which is more properly the job of politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add a footnote to that? The Bill of Rights is an important and integral part of the United States' constitution. It has had a huge impact on social policy through such decisions as Brown v. Board of Education. That decision in Maryland related to education and outlawed discrimination on the grounds of race. It is not hard to understand why such an impulse should lie behind arguments that the Convention should examine the possibility of incorporating at least the justiciable parts of the charter, which was earlier agreed as a political declaration. However, there are the problems to which Ms Stuart referred. The clear preference of many would be for decisions on social and economic policy not to be taken as a matter of judicial interpretation growing from a charter of rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there are no more questions, we will proceed to the debate on the motion,
<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee has considered the First Report (30th April) and the Second Report (20th June) from the United Kingdom Representatives to the Convention on the future of Europe."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I should make it clear that I intend to call the alternate representative and the parliamentary representatives to respond to the debate no later than 9.45 pm.</span></p>
<p>9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say how pleased I was to hear the firm view of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston about the importance of protecting the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. That view would find favour with members of all parties in our delegation to the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
I was also interested in the response made by Lord Maclennan to a question from the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash) about the legal personality of the EU. We have always been told that the EU cannot sign the European convention on human rights because it does not have a legal personality. I urge all our representatives at the European Union Convention to examine that loophole. Since Lord Maclennan has told us that all the legal experts have assured the Convention that the EU has a de facto legal personality, it should be able to sign the convention. In itself, that would prevent competition between one court in Strasbourg and another in Luxembourg—competition that would be bad for human rights and bad for Europe.</span></p>
<p>9.2 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to dwell on points that have emerged in the course of this discussion. First, however, I thank the representatives for the hard work that they are putting into the Convention. It is quite apparent that I am most likely to disagree with Lord Maclennan, although that is no news to anyone because it has been going on for about 18 years—since I first arrived in the House.<br><br>
I do not wish to configure my speech around only what Lord Maclennan said, but he made one or two remarks at the beginning of his presentation that rather ignored a salient fact about the Convention. References made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells to the low electoral turnout, the fact that the Danes turned down proposals for a single currency in a referendum and had previously turned down the Maastricht treaty, that the Irish turned down the Nice treaty and so forth, are indicators of a lack of connection. Indeed, they show positive alienation between the electorates on the one hand and the elite on the other.<br><br>
I make this point because it has not yet come out in the course of our discussion. The nature of a convention of 105 people is that those who are in favour of Lord Maclennan's position and the general thrust towards a federal system—the hunting of the pack, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, which was endorsed by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston—indicate the centre of gravity that will carry the process forward. Therefore, there is a lack of critical analysis that effectively comes, as far as I can judge, from not more than 10 out of 105 people in that convention. If I really stripped it down, the number of people who would ask the type of questions that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I would ask could be counted on the fingers of one hand. The legitimacy of the Convention is vitiated by its lack of proportionality in relation to the basis of the argument put forward not only by our worthy representatives, but by reference to the lack of turnout and connection with the citizens of Europe as a whole. We are given to believe that the outcome will be based on a consensus, but we know what the consensus is before we begin. It has already been established.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
There may be some worthy argument at the margins; for example, some academics may come forward about legal personality. I shall ask Lord Maclennan to supply me with a list of those academics because I would be surprised if there is one who does not already have a consistent track record on a particular route towards the matters to which he would aspire. I am not suggesting that Lord Maclennan had anything to do with their nomination. However, we had such a problem to a certain extent in the European Scrutiny Committee, but it was overcome by the wisdom of that Committee. I said that, during our deliberations on the report on democracy and accountability, we would be talking to people who, by and large, seemed to represent a view that wanted to move towards more integration than I thought was a good idea. I suggested that we put forward some other people and I was extremely glad that we achieved a balance.<br><br>
Jens-Peter Bonde gave evidence to our Committee and made some useful suggestions that were well thought of by the Committee—even if it did not agree with them. He is also a member of the Convention. He is only one of five, so it is important for us to bear in mind the lack of proportionality and the balance of argument that unfortunately vitiates the ultimate consensus that the Committee is likely to come up with, and which is a stitch up from beginning to end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Roger Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way on the point of legal personality. He is arguing that the European Union should not be taking on a legal personality, but he has been saying for years that it already has a legal personality. Is it not the case that, in matters such as trade, the legal personality exists and, rightly so? However, it does not exist in respect of foreign and security policies, nor should it. Has not the right balance been struck? Does it not provide benefits? How can the hon. Gentleman say, on the one hand, that the European Union has a legal personality but, on the other hand, argue that it should not have one in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not want to enter a protracted debate on that issue, save only to say that there is a distinction under—I think—article 2(a)(i) of the European Community treaty between a legal personality that is established with respect to the European Community and the fact that, contrary to what Lord Maclennan said, there is no established legal personality with respect to the expert witnesses, whose names he will no doubt supply, and the legal personality of the European Union. An important point is buttressed by the other assertions under the system, which is that there should be a constitutional treaty or arrangement and a fusion of the pillars. Throw those into a pot and it is game, set and match—I referred to that when replying to Lord Maclennan. Such matters are serious. The Philadelphia convention of 1787 was a far more worthy body than the Convention. It did not set out with preconceptions. It led to some vigorous debates and I have no doubt that it will be seen to be more impressive in its analysis of matters than the Convention.<br><br>
I was very enthusiastic about the fact that our European Scrutiny Committee produced a good
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0627">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
report. However, in case anyone gets too carried away about that, I should add that I tabled 158 amendments to that report, and produced a short minority report to go with it. The principles that lay behind the report led me to do that; it was not that I disagreed with its thrust, but the fact that I had to ask, "What are we going to do if we want the national Parliaments to be in the driving seat?" That is directly relevant to the questions that this Convention raises.<br><br>
I am grateful to the other Committee members for not taking too much umbrage at the points I was making, even though they took up much of their time. They did not take umbrage because they knew that I was trying to be practical. I have never argued for withdrawal. The Minister for Europe summed up my argument today: he said that he wanted repatriation in principle—that he did not want to get into specifics, but that he wanted it in principle. The Committee said that the words "ever closer union" must be taken out of the treaties: it said that we want national accountability and national democracy, and that that must be the bedrock of the EU.<br><br>
However, it is no good saying that in a general way; we must show how it will be done. Therefore, we must tackle the question of the acquis communautaire—as I have so often argued. We must not respect it, as the Laeken declaration—which is the basis of this Convention—states. We must examine it, and have the political will to make the changes that are necessary to reduce the amount of power that has already been extended.<br><br>
We must also be clear about the importance of political will. Ultimately, that is where this matter will be resolved. We can argue for hours in conventions and committee meetings about whether we should go this way or that, but ultimately our responsibility is to the people who have elected us to this House. They go down to their village halls to cast their votes. This is a matter of incredible importance, for which people have fought and died all over Europe, and I believe that this Convention will completely fail in its objectives if it does not muster the political will to deliver democracy at that level—at the grassroots. I fear that that is not what will happen. I urge our representatives to go back to that Convention with those thoughts in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that we have barely 32 minutes left for general discussion, prior to the referral to the representatives.</span></p>
<p>9.32 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook. I am conscious of that fact. I thank the House authorities for constructing this Committee in which we are able to hear the members of the Convention, and I welcome the fact that Members of the House of Lords were enthusiastic in their attendance.<br><br>
I am not a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and it would have been beneficial to me if members of that Committee had put more questions, because then I might have got some impression of the angle at which they are coming at this Convention. I am a member of the European Scrutiny Committee,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
which has paid great attention to it; we have produced a report and interrogated Ministers—in fact, we even interrogated our parliamentary representatives on one occasion. I am particularly grateful to the substitute member, Lord Maclennan, as well as to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and the right hon. Member for Wells, for attending.<br><br>
A few things stand out from the question and answer session that should be taken on board by our representatives. First, they should not compare themselves to the 1787 convention that was referred to by the hon. Member for Stone, because the French revolution of 1789 followed two years later. That was a different period: we are not involved in such a bloodthirsty enterprise. This is a more balanced exercise, and I hope that they will respond to it in a proper spirit.<br><br>
On the general question of subsidiarity, I have serious concerns. It appears as though, because Members of European Parliament may have set their face against the idea of a second chamber, they have conditioned themselves against any subsidiarity that suggests that the construct they have put together—the co-decision making of the Council and the European Parliament—would be diluted if anything were passed back down to the level at which it should properly be carried out. By that I mean the level of the nation state and, I seriously suggest, the sub-nation state if, like the Scottish Parliament, a sub-nation state body has the responsibility of legislating for European directives. That is an issue to be discussed in the context of subsidiarity.<br><br>
The Scottish Parliament must draw up laws in Scotland for devolved matters covered by directives. It is an open question—and the Scrutiny Committee's report perhaps opened the door a little further so that people can see the light coming in—as to whether it might be sensible for the Scottish Executive and civil servants to have privileged access to the Commission and those who put together the directives. That way, when the Scottish Executive legislates, it will do so using full knowledge, and not knowledge filtered through the UK civil service. I am not saying that that is the conclusion that will be reached, but it is certainly one that has many strong attractions for me at the moment.<br><br>
I find what has been said slightly confusing, because we do not really have a UK parliamentary delegation, in which hon. Members are out there on the floor trying to express the view of the UK Parliament. The Conservative member of the delegation, who was chosen by the Conservative party from those available to it, has been putting across a firm view about the future of the European Union that I find quite extreme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I ought to mention that the Conservative party did not use whipping or anything of that kind when electing my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. He was elected in a free vote that was open to members of the parliamentary party. My right hon. Friend can speak for himself, but I should say that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) knows the divisions in the Conservative party on the subject. He can take it that my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0628">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Friend the Member for Wells has full authority to speak on behalf of the party, and need not have regard to the fact that he was voted in by a majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very interesting insight into the democratic processes of the parliamentary Conservative party. My point, as <i>Hansard</i> will show, is that some of the views that the right hon. Member for Wells holds strongly—and I respect him for it—were expressed in the original statement. He basically suggested not amendment or improvement, but a dismantling of the European Union as we know it. I think that that is quite an extreme view, although I may have a jaundiced view of it, having heard it repeated by the hon. Member for Stone time and again as we wandered around the accession countries.<br><br>
Scrutiny and accountability must be markedly improved if we are ever to reconnect with the people who sent us here. We lose credibility over matters such as the refrigerator mountain and the directive on which I questioned the Minister today, which, if put into law, will stop people using food supplements and herbal medicines. The vast majority of people think that that is a subsidiarity matter, and an issue for the UK Parliament, but it has been directed from Europe. I see so many notes expressing worry that the praesidium might, after all talk is done, turn out a document that we will have to rubber-stamp or to which we will have to make a few minor amendments.<br><br>
If the process does not come from the bottom up, and if all the civic and other groups are just window dressing, we will have a much more jaundiced view of what is going on in Europe, and the oligarchy will continue to rule, instead of the democrats telling the oligarchy that it is time to move aside and deciding the programme for the future of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I ought now to make a point that I was saving for the end of the sitting. I have deliberately been lenient this evening in not insisting, as I should have done, on the use of constituencies rather than names. I allowed that because it is a mixed meeting of both Commons and Lords. It is probably appropriate to say that right hon. and hon. Members of the Commons should recall that we refer to our colleagues by the name of their constituency. To help with that, we have an aide memoire that is easy to read. I call Lord Howell.</span></p>
<p>9.19 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Howell of Guildford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for that ruling, Mr. Cook. It will certainly make my life a little easier. This is turning out to be an extremely interesting and valuable evening, and I offer the Committee my profound apologies for arriving a few minutes late for the opening of this part of the Committee sitting, but we have quite a long way to walk to return from our dinner.<br><br>
I begin with the strongest expression of congratulation to the two representatives of the Convention and to the substitute, Lord Maclennan, on their fortitude. Their task is impossible. They are called representatives, but under the system in the House of Commons, there is no recognised validity in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
the concept of representatives. Each Member of Parliament represents their own constituents, to whom they owe their judgment, and Parliament can reach by majority certain views. The idea that the views of Parliament on these vastly complex and evolving issues can be effectively represented is too ambitious. The task of our excellent Members in the Convention will be extremely difficult, and they have my sympathy and support in trying to find a way through the labyrinth.<br><br>
The House of Lords, which is, for the moment, an advisory, scrutinising, second-thoughts Chamber, without democratic mandate, has a tradition of addressing seriously and in detail a range of issues that relate to the European Union and its development. Speaking only for myself, as I represent no constituents these days, there is a very deep concern about the future of European unity and the effectiveness of the European Union. The more we go into detail in our Committees and the more we debate such matters—at the moment there is not much time, as we are full-time in handling legislation that arrives from your House, Mr. Cook—the more alarmed we become that the issues that will bind Europe together are not being addressed and that matters that will tear Europe apart and create impossible tensions are being allowed to fester.<br><br>
We heard eloquent comments this evening from Mr. Cash and others about the feeling of remoteness in relation to all European institutions. That inevitably includes the Parliament as well as the Courts, the Commission and the Council of Ministers. It is partly related, as the Prime Minister told another Committee today, to problems in each of our democracies. Each member state's Parliament is experiencing additional problems in the information age in maintaining communication and not living in a political vacuum. That is a problem at national level, but it is a particular problem and, indeed, is accentuated at European level. The question is whether it is being addressed.<br><br>
The two representatives who have spoken so eloquently must by now have a clear view about the fundamental issue—not that of power to the Commission, to an intergovernmental Council of Ministers or to the Parliament, but of relating decisions to and commanding the trust of the people of the different nation states of Europe. That is the central issue, and until it is addressed, one watches with growing foreboding the forces that will tear—undermine—the European unity that many of us have worked for and been involved in for many decades.<br><br>
We have that problem and the imposition by, inevitably, elites and political groups and lobbies of certain views that are not properly debated. We have sheer overload in a system that is trying to achieve in the next five years something that really should take another 50 years to do in the way of a single defence and common foreign policy. The single money is going ahead, and a single diplomatic corps has been suggested. Those are all huge projects that, if crammed into the next few years, will create impossible indigestion.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
We have the new applicants, and their fears about the acquis communautaire. Countries such as Poland are worried that if they are asked to be net contributors to the budget of the enlarged Union, they will find the proposal unsaleable. Any responsible Polish leader—there have been many in this Parliament in the past few weeks—will tell us that that is the danger. Such countries will find that they cannot carry their constituents toward the development and enlargement of the European Union.<br><br>
The agonies of reforming the common agricultural policy are just beginning to emerge. I do not know how the convention will address such problems and avoid the feeling that the applicant states will be second-class states on low rates of subsidy or none at all, and therefore placed at an appalling disadvantage compared with the protected farmers of western Europe. On the foreign policy side, a growing sense of rivalry with the United States is entering the language. There just is not room for rivalry with the United States in the modern world. Europe must work with it on every front if we are to confront the much larger dangers facing us all.<br><br>
I remember going to see Jean Monet as a young man, and listening to his plans of how progress would probably have to be made by stealth because democratic Governments would not agree to it. Perhaps I should have pressed him with the fact that, after 40 years of success, the Monet model would be over. There can be no further proceeding on the basis of stealth. There must be a total involvement. If the worries expressed can help delegates and their substitutes in the Convention, they are worth uttering, but we are very, very concerned that the true interests of Europe are not being addressed by the Convention, or by any other rather remote institutions that take power, decisions and trust away from the people.</span></p>
<p>9.27 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make three brief points, but before I do that I thank the three representatives of the convention, Lord Maclennan, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston and the right hon. Member for Wells, for their reporting back this evening. It has been first rate, even though some of us may disagree with some of the points made. I thank them very much indeed.<br><br>
My first point is that if we accept, as I do, that in essence the European Union is an association of independent sovereign states that choose to pool their sovereignty from time to time and from issue to issue, the Convention will have to focus increasingly on the role of the Council of Ministers. The Council has to have a far more strategic role in the future. If we look at the second and third pillars, for example, there is an argument to be made for greater coherence on common foreign and security policy, on the new European security defence policy and on justice and home affairs. Those areas are very technical, but they get to the core of how Europe might develop in the future. The role of national Governments is central in that respect.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
That development of Europe requires the Council to take a much more hands-on role. The Council, rather than the Commission, must take a strategic lead, perhaps coming forward with a multi-annual work programme that sets out exactly where the national Governments see the European Union going, not in months, but in years ahead. An interesting suggestion that has been made, which has not, I think, been referred to tonight, is the notion of having a president of the Council. There is much to be said for that. I hope that serious consideration will be given to that during the months ahead.<br><br>
My second point relates to enlargement. I thank the representatives for correcting me when I made the erroneous remark that the representatives from the accession countries were there as observers. They were clearly not, but I can be forgiven for thinking that because I understand that the contribution from those representatives has been very small. The driving force on the Convention has come from the representatives of the 15 EU member states. That is a shame, and it needs to be addressed in future.<br><br>
I say that not just because of the internal work of the Convention, but because, during the next couple of years, there are likely to be referendums in those accession countries for people to decide whether they want to join the EU. The questions that will be raised during those referendums will not simply concern the terms that have been negotiated, but will be asking people how they see Europe developing in the future. It is very important that their representatives in the Convention are clearly seen as stakeholders in the development of a new Europe, so that they already feel a sense of genuine ownership of what is being discussed, debated and hopefully agreed.<br><br>
My third and final point regards the issue of the role of national Parliaments. Like many other Members, I think that in future much will depend on whether we can win the argument in favour of national Parliaments having a central role in Europe's collective development. There is a broad measure of agreement on that, not just between the two Houses in this place, but between the political parties. I hope that our representatives, although they will have profound political disagreements during the course of the next few months, make a concerted effort to ensure that there is a degree of common ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to tempt the hon. Gentleman into territory that he would not want to engage in, but he may remember some of the remarks that I have made during recent months concerning the Whipping system and issues of vital national interest. In the context of the EU and its movement towards integration, and the desire that by all accounts we all share to enhance the role of national Parliaments, some reform of the Whipping system is required if national Parliaments—as compared with national Governments in the light of qualified majority votes—are to have the opportunity to have their voices heard, rather than talking about whether it is a good idea for them to be heard. The difference is between action and talking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I shall not be tempted into that area. I shall stick to the remark
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0630">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
that I was making, which is a limited but important comment on the Convention.<br><br>
Representatives of this national Parliament should make every effort to find common ground in terms of the developing influence of national Parliaments. I think that it is a case that can be legitimately argued because, as the hon. Gentleman will know, during the European Scrutiny Committee debates, significant common ground was established between the parties. The report that was agreed by the Committee received overwhelming support from all parties involved. That is an indication that it is possible to have agreement on the role of national Parliaments. I would conclude by saying that the acid test for many people of whether the Convention has been successful will be whether a coherent, well-thought out position is expressed, with regard to the role of national Parliaments. I certainly hope that that will be the case as far as our national representatives are concerned.</span></p>
<p>9.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Roger Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am utterly delighted that this Committee is taking place. It is unusual to have a Standing Committee at 7.30 pm, especially on a hot summer's evening when we are on a one-line Whip. However, we are making progress—that is the important thing—we are quorate and the Committee is able to perform its very important job: to hold our representatives on the Convention on the future of Europe to account.<br><br>
I am delighted, as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee that worked hard to put forward the idea of such an innovative Standing Committee, to see that Committee taking shape and taking place. The European Scrutiny Committee believes that there are some very important matters in relation to Europe for which insufficient time was available for full debate in the House. That is to say insufficient time was available for Members of the House of Commons to debate not only the Convention but other matters, such as the Commission's work programme and the broad economic guidelines that require fuller debate. If this Committee proves to be a success—we have made a good start today—we might be able to examine applying it, with colleagues from the other place, in the consideration of other European matters of great importance that cannot be debated on the Floor of the House because of pressure of time.<br><br>
I should place on record the specific reference in the European Scrutiny Committee's report to the need for a European Grand Committee. This Standing Committee, which is having its inaugural meeting this evening, could prove to be the precursor to such a Committee.<br><br>
I shall repeat remarks that I made earlier this evening welcoming the commitment of our delegates to the success of the Convention. As has been said, there will be many different points of view. Different members of this Committee and different Members of the House of Commons will have different views, and it is right that we should hear the views of individual Members. One would not expect any Member to agree
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
with everything that any other Member said, but I wish that the right hon. Member for Wells would perhaps spend a bit more time looking for positive things to say about the European Union and a little less time searching for negative points. Like everything and everybody, there is good and bad about the European Union.<br><br>
On the plus side, it is important to put on record on an occasion such as this the fact that the European Union has delivered 50 years of peace in Europe. Through the single market it has delivered unparalleled prosperity for European citizens. It has given Europe a strong currency that surpassed the US dollar in value earlier this week. It is moving into areas of common foreign and security policy and offering not only prosperity and peace but security to the citizens of Europe in the future.<br><br>
It is incumbent on our delegates to put forward not only their ideas and views but to do the best that they can—they will not fail us—to represent the mood and the views expressed in the House of Commons, not least in this Committee. The purpose of this Committee is to allow Members of Parliament to come along and express their views to our representatives who can take those views forward to the Convention. Of course, I know that our procedures in the House of Commons are not exactly the same as the procedures in the other place and everyone will have their view about what it means to be a representative, but I am encouraged by what we have heard this evening from our delegates to believe that the views expressed in the debate—we will hear more of this in the winding-up speeches—will as far as it is possible and reasonable be reflected in the contribution that they make in their individual ways to the Convention.<br><br>
The Convention on the future of Europe is not the Philadelphia convention, but is an important moment for Europe—an important democratic moment too. I hope that future meetings of this Committee will attract contributions from Members of the House who may not have a particular view on or interest in Europe, but who are concerned and moved by the important democratic issues and challenges that we are facing up to in the Convention. All who care about the health of our democracy, all who care about the relationship between the governed and those who govern us, and all who take a serious interest in how our laws are made should be aware of, and where possible participate in and contribute their views to, the questions that are being raised by the future of Europe Convention.<br><br>
I referred earlier to the European Scrutiny Committee's work. We have published two important and major reports on democracy and accountability in the European Union and European scrutiny in the House of Commons. I am pleased to say that there has been tremendous demand for those reports from Committees in national Parliaments throughout Europe. I wish that the high regard in which the European Scrutiny Committee is clearly held by other national Parliaments in the European Union also applied to some of the other Committees of the House. As we have the opportunity to work
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
together, especially with other departmental Select Committees, and as we develop our scrutiny system in the Commons, perhaps that will take effect.<br><br>
Our central concern on the European Scrutiny Committee has been to bring European decision making closer to the citizen. What does that mean in practice? It means that we want European decision making to be more open, transparent and accountable but, crucially, we wish to increase the role of national Parliaments in the European decision-making process. We want to do that not least because national Parliaments are the physical embodiment of the link between Ministers and decision makers, and the citizen. I am sure that Members who invite their constituents to visit the House of Commons are struck by the reverence and awe in which they hold not us the Members, but the institution and what it stands for. It is the physical link between the elected representative and the decision maker in government. That is why, if we are concerned about increasing the democratic accountability of the European Union, it is very important to strengthen the role of national Parliaments and give a greater role to national parliamentarians, as the crucial links between the citizen and the decision-making process.<br><br>
There are low turnouts for local government elections. It is not particularly a fault of the European Union. There is alienation from politics throughout the political system, but the peculiarity of European Union institutions is that they are remote. That is why it is so important that there is some intermediate link or bridge between the European Union and the state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be good enough to confirm that it would be better if other national Parliaments in Europe paid more attention to their procedures to ensure that the aims of democracy and accountability are fulfilled?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Roger Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do think that that would be a good idea but, with respect, the hon. Gentleman has had a taste of his own medicine. The point about national Parliaments is that they are sovereign. Who are we, as another national Parliament, or the Convention to dictate to national Parliaments in Europe how they are to conduct their business? My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston kindly referred to my paper on national Parliaments. The Committee will be pleased to hear that I do not have time now to elaborate on my recommendations. However, one suggestion that I made is that we try to get national Parliaments to sign up to a charter and freely commit themselves to improving their procedures and to performing better the role as a link between the European citizen and the decision-making processes.<br><br>
The second reason why we need to involve national Parliaments more in European decision making is that it is becoming clear that national Parliaments and Governments are losing some of the powers that they once had to control the destiny of their citizens. That is not because of some conspiracy to hand powers over but because of the nature of the world that we live in: a global economy, in which decisions that are taken by investment bankers in Japan affect the jobs of people in our constituencies. We must recognise that we live
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
in a much more international world in terms of economics, and that our politics must become more international, too. As powers move from a national to an international system but also through devolution to a regional system, we must improve and increase the scrutiny role of national Parliaments and parliamentarians.<br><br>
The Convention on the future of Europe is an opportunity for us in this Parliament to enhance and increase our scrutiny role in European decision making. We have made a good start this evening. I thank representatives for their contribution and look forward to further progress through the Committee. We must make progress, because the cost of failure will be to abandon the field to those who wish, ultimately, to undermine the European project. We must succeed above all on behalf of those whom we represent in this place whose prosperity and peace in the future depends as much on the success of the European Union as it has done in the past.</span></p>
<p>9.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord Maclennan of Rogart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by expressing my gratitude to the authorities of the House of Commons for organising the Committee to conduct these discussions, which are of inestimable value? I link that general gratitude to my particular gratitude to those who have chosen to participate in our debate. It has been informative and significant in emphasising the importance that the House of Commons—of which I am no longer a Member, alas—attaches to aspects of our discussion.<br><br>
It is very easy to become bogged down in the detail. Lord Howell said that we must grapple with a great deal of detail, but we must not and will not lose sight of the context in which these examinations take place. It is true, as Mr. Casale said, that the countries of the European Union have enjoyed 50 years of peace. It is also true that the liberation of eastern Europe and the reunification of the continent of Europe present new opportunities for the concerting of policies to enable Europe to speak in the dangerous world in which we live with greater coherence and effectiveness. It is also true that that cannot be looked for as a product of the institutions of the European Union if they do not enjoy the support of the citizens of Europe. It is a major challenge.<br><br>
Neither I nor my party entered these discussions with a clear view of the end point. However, it has been described as federalist. All I can say is that the European Union seems to me not to resemble a federation—at least, it is a federation with a difference. I would not want to construct on the European continent a classical federation, and I hope that seeking ways of balancing effectiveness, democracy and transparency will not be dismissed as the effort of someone with a pre-ordained view of what the desirable outcome should be. The decisions to be taken are extremely difficult and creative and follow no pre-ordained pattern.<br><br>
It is perhaps appropriate to emphasise the impression made on me by our discussion of the role of national Parliaments. I do not doubt their legitimacy or the acceptance of their legitimacy. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
should be possible to involve those Parliaments in a way that helps the Union and takes forward some of the best practices followed in other member countries to enhance acceptability of what is being attempted on behalf of the citizens of Europe and to make it more immediately accountable and understandable throughout the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p>9.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European Union is around 45 years old and I agree with Lord Howell and others who said that it must change. It is no good continuing to justify the structure and procedures by reference to European reconstruction after the second world war, when efficiency and executive acts were possibly more important than democracy. The fact is that today, the European Union does things that intimately affect the public. Its regulations and directives are massively more numerous and more important.<br><br>
In any mature democracy, people must feel a sense of involvement and that they have a chance to change things, even if the measures are themselves desirable. Many environmental measures, for example, are a good thing. Democracy is about debating such measures and examining their implications and the necessary trade-offs among taxation, economic efficiency and social objectives. Such debates are the fuel on which democracy runs, but they are just not happening in the European Union. Scrutiny, which Committees of both Houses nobly undertake, is no substitute if we are simply scrutinising a done deal, with no realistic chance of influencing the outcome.<br><br>
I believe that it is part of being a citizen to feel that one can make choices. One matures, and one's country matures, by making choices and seeing their outcome. That is how all countries progress. We learn by mistakes and we can reverse mistakes. Electorates can reverse them. Such processes are almost wholly absent in the European Union. Instead, one has a perception of a steamroller. That is certainly how the public see the system, and that is why they have almost given up. They grumble, but they feel that it has an inevitability about it and that many of the decisions are made in a submerged part of the Union. It is in the—literally—hundreds of technical working groups and committees that many decisions are made and, in some cases, originate.<br><br>
I have tried, inadequately, to sketch out an alternative, but I do not want that to be seen as a recipe for paralysis. There are things that ought to be done on a larger canvas, and it enhances our own national and parliamentary powers if we can cooperate, and get others to agree and come along with us. That process, however, can take a long time and there are no short cuts. For example, certain core competencies must remain and be resolved by majority voting. However, if a member state felt that its national interests were threatened, and the Parliament concerned objected to a proposal, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
should reintroduce a form of parliamentary Luxembourg compromise so that a veto could be exercised. That would not be a diplomatic move; it could create a political crisis and much debate in the Parliament of the member state concerned. The Ministers concerned would have to go to the next European summit and defend their position. That would be democratic and would create the debate and discussion that we want there to be on European issues.<br><br>
I am pleased that the hon. Members for Caerphilly (Mr. David) and for Wimbledon (Roger Casale), and others, have emphasised the importance of the parliamentary dimension. I am personally very pleased that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston is chairing the committee concerned, which is absolutely key. We must be creative, and not afraid to make propositions that run into immediate opposition from some vested interests—if we can show that they would not necessarily paralyse the good things about Europe.<br><br>
My last comment refers to the important point made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) about sub-national Assemblies and Parliaments. We must give more and better thought to how we can enrich the process at their level. I notice that many of them have offices in Brussels, which is not the way to go forward. Powers should rather be returned to the national level so that we can pass them on, where necessary, to Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. That would be better than trying to influence a process by directly addressing the Commission and others from a multitude of regional offices.</span></p>
<p>9.55 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Stuart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Convention confronts the two past failures of the treaties of Amsterdam and of Nice to establish a framework that allows us to move towards enlargement. We are in the process of enlarging, and we must enlarge because we owe a historic debt to bring Europe together within its historic boundaries. We should not forget that the Convention is so important because it enables us to enlarge.<br><br>
Lord Howell referred to our difficult task, particularly in representing the House—neither House has a historic means by which it asserts its will. I am deeply grateful to all Members of the Commons and the Lords who have attended today. Their presence allows the representatives to return to the Convention with a greater understanding of how some Members think. I very much hope that we can repeat such meetings to enable a continuous dialogue, and that we find some will in the House that can be carried through into the Convention.</span></p>
