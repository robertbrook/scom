	<p>Amendment proposed [	<i>17th February</i>], in page 6, line 31, at end, insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that the Minister may from time to time by order direct that this subsection shall have effect, in relation to houses approved after the date on which the order comes into force, so that instead of the contributions to be made by the local authority being equal to the contributions payable as aforesaid by the Minister the local authority's contributions shall be equal to such proper fraction of the Minister's contributions as may be specified in the order.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) An order of the Minister under the last foregoing subsection shall be of no effect until it is approved by a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament.—[	<i>Mr. Mitchison.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Question again proposed. "That those words be there inserted"</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. R. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cheered as I am by the presence of the hon Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Wade), I really have little to add to what I said yesterday. The object of the Amendment is to enable the Minister, in appropriate circumstances, to be more kind to the local authorities in the matter of proportion of subsidy. That is effected by the ingenious use of the simple mathematical term, "proper fraction" It is not the least use people from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government trying to protest that they do not know what a proper fraction is. A Ministry capable of dealing with the Exchequer Equalisation Grant must be up to fantastic achievements in higher or obscure mathematics. They know perfectly well that the effect of putting into the Clause these potent words will be that the Minister will be able to do good to the local authorities and not to do harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the Amendment in the same page and line of Clause 6 which is on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins):
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The Minister may from time to time by order direct that the contributions to be made by a local authority under the foregoing subsection in respect of houses purchased after the date on which the order comes into force shall be of such larger or smaller part of the contributions payable by the Minister under subsection (2) of section five in respect of such houses as may be specified in the order.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) An order of the Minister under the foregoing subsection shall be of no effect until it is approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament"</p></blockquote>
That Amendment commended itself to the Minister yesterday. It enables him not only to be kind but to be even harsher to the local authorities than he is at present, and it allows him to commit the mathematical solecism of appropriating a part which is larger than the whole, and that is a thing which this Minister in particular ought never to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I hope that the Minister, sympathetically disposed as I understand him to be towards the principle of both these Amendments, will prefer mine as the kinder to the local authorities, the more reasonable and, from the point of view of the English language and simple mathematics, the more correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. W. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge the Minister to accept the Amendment. Even though there may be difficulties in the minds of people who have not been to public school in appreciating exactly what is a proper fraction and what is its effect, the object of the Amendment is clear. It is to try to get the Minister to take power, when he is considering the question of the grant, to change the proportion as between the local authorities and the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would only remind the Minister that this is a point on which all the local authorities have been very keen right from the beginning. The change of proportion of subsidy, from three to one to one to one, which this Bill involves, means inevitably that when a job is done on a very large scale it imposes a much more severe rate burden on every housing authority. The Minister knows that all the local authorities, including my own, who have had very great experience in administering Housing Acts and who have built up their procedure on the basis of a three-to-one proportion, are very concerned about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
I am not one who wants to see the State finding all the money for local government. I think that it is healthy and good that those responsible for local government should bear something of the financial implications of their policy. But I suggest that that cannot be done in the fullest sense until there has been a complete review of local government finance—a subject which I accept it is out of order to argue now. The plain fact is that even on the basis of the present proportion of subsidy between State and local authorities, the cost of their housing operations is not merely becoming heavier but is becoming an alarmingly heavy burden on local rates. Local authorities, therefore, are very much upset about this change of proportion from three to one to one to one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree to look sympathetically at the Amendment. I regret that I was unable to be here yesterday, but I noticed on reading the OFFICIAL REPORT that the Parliamentary Secretary made some sort of friendly gestures in this direction although, as I read it, he referred to the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Dulwich, which provides that the proportion might also be smaller rather than larger in circumstances which the Minister thinks proper. I think that that is wrong and I hope that the Minister will agree to look at this matter a little more than sympathetically. I hope that he will do so with a determination to see that when the time comes to review the subsidies or to look again at the amount that is to be paid for the type of housing work dealt with in this part of the Bill he will agree to be kinder towards local authorities who claim that the proportion should be three to one. I have, therefore, much pleasure in supporting the Amendment in the hope that the Minister will be able to act in the way in which I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members on the benches opposite have kept on talking about the Minister changing the ratio from three to one to one to one, and the hon. Member for Clapham (Mr. Gibson) has reasserted that contention. The fact is, of course, that it is nothing of the sort. The Minister has made no change whatsoever in the ratio for housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>458</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member, but I said very carefully that the change was in relation to the housing which is affected by Part I of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the argument used was that in respect of the first part a change had been made from three to one to one to one. The Minister is making no change whatsoever in the housing subsidies. When the houses which we are now discussing are pulled down the Minister will then give on new housing sites a grant in the proportion of three to one. The proportion is only one to one where social service is being done, that is patching. Therefore, that is something entirely new and not comparable with any other ratio or proportion of Government subsidy to rate subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer my Amendment to the Amendment in the name of the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), but as the Minister indicated yesterday that he was going to consider these two Amendments sympathetically and therefore he is probably likely to make a statement, perhaps it would be wise for us to wait to hear what he says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that the Minister has token power to vary Exchequer contributions and local authority contributions up or down, it seems proper that he should take to himself the same reserve powers to alter the ratio as between the local authority and the Exchequer. I do not think there is any doubt whatever, among those who have some knowledge of housing and the way in which this will work, that this job will cost considerably more money per annum than the two subsidies totalling £6 a year would suggest. Therefore, there is not the slightest doubt—and the Minister might be warned of it—that if he concedes the principle of these two Amendments he or his successors will be faced, very properly, with applications by local authorities that, in the light of experience, the ratio should be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair and just that, having taken the reserve powers in one case, the Minister should take reserve powers as to the ratio between the local authorities and the Exchequer here. On behalf of local authorities who asked me to move an Amendment I want to say that I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>459</span>
most grateful to the Minister for the indication which he gave yesterday, and I hope very sincerely that he will implement it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Edith Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. R. Jenkins). I have been asked to do so by my own local authority, Birmingham. I feel that this is an instance where the experience of Birmingham—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. T. Paget</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Are we discussing the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. R. Jenkins)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. We are discussing both Amendments together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that this is an instance where the experience which Birmingham has so far gained has resulted in support for a recommendation which could help other local authorities. Birmingham feels that the financial obligation of local authorities will toe a very heavy one under the provisions of this Bill. It is felt that if my hon. Friend's Amendment were accepted it would encourage local authorities, because the Bill provides a new experience of the proportion of Government grant and local authority expenditure placing a much larger share of the cost on the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us will wish to take our eyes off the ball, and one of the ultimate purposes of this Bill is re-development. I am sure that no hon. Member would wish to encourage proposals which might be so attractive to local authorities that they might be led to retain sub-standard houses. I am sure that other hon. Members will confirm that local authorities are passionately keen to sweep slum areas away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sometimes dismays them in taking over "make do and mend" properties is the unexpected difficulties which they know will arise, the extra delays which often happen, and the fact that frequently the actual expenditure exceeds their estimates. I feel, therefore, that if the Minister can accept the Amendment and show that he is prepared to be flexible in the matter—he is not asked to bind himself, but to make a review in the light of experience—it will give
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>
yet another indication to local authorities of his determination to support them. It will encourage the local authorities—Birmingham included, because there is still much more to be done there—to use these powers to the widest extent to patch up for the time being, and eventually to clear and provide new houses on the site.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I gather from the hon. Lady that Birmingham is anxious that the Minister should take power to increase its proportion of the contribution in relation to his, or is it only that she has received what I may call the usual Banwell letter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious, as always, to be fair in these matters. The recommendation which I have from my local authority is that I should support, and I gladly support, the Amendment which says that the Minister may take power to vary, either up or down, because we rely on the sympathy of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paget</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every Member of the Committee will have heard with relief and some admiration that the hon. Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) has an Amendment which he actually intends to support. I find some difficulty on this occasion, however, in understanding how the Amendment which he has in mind can possibly be of service to local authorities. In his speech he drew a distinction Which I am bound to say was new to me, in that he said that this was a social service payment and not a housing payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always understood that public money was used for housing because housing was a social service. He said, however, that this is something different from housing. I understood that the object of this was to house people in rather more tolerable conditions than they are in at present. If one may take a parallel, what is the position with regard to requisitioning? That was a temporary measure, and the terms there with regard to the local authority were even more favourable. My own local authority objected to this and felt that the ratio should be at least as good for new housing, and my town clerk gave me three solid reasons which I feel ought to be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman goes on to his next point, may I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>461</span>
point out that, so far as Government subsidies are concerned, local authorities take no Exchequer grant in respect of the losses which they make under Sections 9 and 10 of the 1936 Housing Act. If deficiencies are in fact incurred, there is no Exchequer subsidy. I think that the analogy is fair, and that the work done under Section 9 and Section 10 of the 1936 Housing Act is in some ways more comparable with the work which is being done under "Operation Rescue" In this case the Government do in fact offer 50 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paget</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the obvious argument, but so far as I can recollect, under Section 9 and Section 10 of the 1936 Act the work was paid for by the owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is not aware of the provisions of Section 10. He will find there that, in default of the owner paying, the local authority is empowered to carry out the work and charge the owner with the cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paget</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. The owner pays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the war, local authorities have found that in operating Section 10 they have been unable to recover the money, because the house has become less valuable than the amount of money spent. In the case of one local authority of which I have very great knowledge there is an outstanding debt of £17,000, a very large proportion of which will be irrecoverable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paget</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a suggestion to the hon. Member for another Amendment, which I shall be delighted to support, and that is that this patching should be paid for by the owners whose neglect has made it necessary. If the hon. Member will put down an Amendment to put this on all fours with Sections 9 and 10 of the 1936 Act, that is an Amendment which we will support, though I doubt whether he will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us have no more of this nonsense, no more of this contention that there is something different in patching from housing. Both are operations for housing people as a social service. If the two methods, temporary housing and now temporary patching, are to be judged on their merits, then they should be similarly financed. If the Government finance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>462</span>
patching differently, it is simply because, for window-dressing purposes, they do not want to deal with it on its merits. This patching operation arises primarily out of the war, which was the cause of the arrears of slum clearance which have made it necessary, and as such it ought to be a Government charge. It comes at a time when building costs have risen quite disproportionately to the purchasing power of the rate income available to local authorities. It requires not less support but more support than was received before the war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is, however, as I have said, simply a window-dressing Clause. As such, it is appropriate to this part of the Bill, which is a window-dressing part of the Bill. The proportion put down here does not affect the amount paid by anybody; the Treasury's subscription remains the same, and the balance is paid by the local authority. Whether we have a proportion of one to one or one to ten, that is still the situation. What, then, matters here? What matters is how it looks from the Ministry's point of view. This subscription is raised so as to reduce the deficit, so that the deficit will not look so bad, and so that the real comparison between new housing and patching can be disguised, as the two things are being based on different financial regimes. That is what the real issue here is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can very well understand why the Minister prefers the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Dulwich to that in the name of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison). That, I think, was explained by the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday. What he then said was something like this: if we have a deficit, then if we lower the local authority's contribution we lower the amount in the fund, and we increase the deficit. We know perfectly well that there will be a deficit; so far as this scheme works at all, it will work only if there is a deficit. As I follow the Parliamentary Secretary's argument, the larger the deficit the better the case is for a bigger contribution from the local authority. That is the case which was put to us yesterday, and it means that a large deficit will call for an alteration of the ratio unfavourable to the local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>463</span>
authority, in order to reduce the deficit on this account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have not heard is what are the circumstances which will justify a movement the other way. A large deficit, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, means that more money is required from the local authority. But what are the circumstances—I hope that the Government will tell us this—which will lead the Minister to alter the ratio in favour of the local authority? Will it be if this account is showing a profit? Will it happen if the cost of patching is less than £6 a year? If that was the condition of a change which was favourable to the local authority it would be a reasonable one, because if it were costing less than £6 a year there would be less money to be found, and the local authority would not put up so much. That would be understandable. We know perfectly well, however, that that will not happen. This is really a proposal not to make an alteration in favour of a local authority, but to make an alteration against it, and as such I for my part shall certainly oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (Mr. Ernest Marples)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to disturb the harmonious atmosphere which has prevailed this morning, so that I should like to say at once that my right hon. Friend accepts the principle behind the two Amendments which we are now considering. The wording is not quite as we should like it, and I want to make it clear to the Committee what is being accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 5 there are two distinct types of grant. The first is on the acquisition of the site, and it is a percentage grant, because the amount payable is outside the control of the local authority; it is fixed by the district valuer, and so on. The second type is the patching grant. This is where, I think, some little confusion arose in the mind of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) yesterday. What is spent on patching is solely in the hands of the local authority, and therefore the local authority has a unit grant. This Amendment which has been accepted in principle does not affect the first grant, which is for the acquisition of the site, and that remains
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>464</span>
fixed under the Bill; it refers only to the unit grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, being flexible as always, has decided that this is a new type of procedure and that we do not know how it will work. It may be two or three years before we find out. Therefore, as he already has power to vary the amount of the patching grant, it is only logical that he should have the permissive power to vary the ratio between the local authority and the Exchequer in making up that patching grant. He will therefore accept the Amendment in principle. If the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) will withdraw his Amendment, we will see whether we can find words which are suitable on the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the wording, there are some differences between the two Amendments. The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kettering, for example, speaks in his Amendment of
	<br><blockquote><p>"houses approved after the date on which the order comes in to force"</p></blockquote>
whereas the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Robert Jenkins) speaks of
	<br><blockquote><p>"houses purchased after the date on which the order comes into force"</p></blockquote>
One is, "houses approved" and the other "houses purchased" The wording of the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kettering brings in a wider field, which I think is right and proper. The second difference is that the hon. and learned Member for Kettering does not seem to like the House of Lords, because he says that the orders would require approval
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament"</p></blockquote>
There are therefore certain differences in the wording, but, as we have accepted the principle he so lucidly developed yesterday, we will try to find a suitable form of words on the Report stage, if he will withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will do so, but first I want to see where we are getting. Is the position this: that, having regard both to the Money Resolution and to the terms of subsection (2) of this Clause, the only thing that the Minister can alter is the patching grant, and not the site grant, if I may so describe it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paget</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not entirely follow what the Parliamentary Secretary said; whether he accepted the principle that the power to vary the proportion should be exercised only in favour of the local authority, as in my hon. and learned Friend's Amendment, or whether it should be varied either way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an academic point. Power, I think, will be taken to vary it either way, but my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Aneurin Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 6, line 41, to leave out subsection (1) and to insert:

	<ol>

This is a very important Clause indeed, which is a radical improvement upon the existing law. Subsection (4) of Section 188 of the 1936 Act provides a test for determining when a house is unfit, but it is, as the Minister has decided—and I entirely agree with him—an extraordinarily bad piece of legislation. At the time, perhaps, nothing better could be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>466</span>
done, but it is a vague piece of legislation. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining for the purposes of this Act whether a house is fit for human habitation, regard shall be had to the extent, if any, to which by reason of disrepair or sanitary defects the house falls short of the provisions of any bye-laws in operation in the district or of any enactment in any local Act in operation in the district dealing with the construction and drainage of new buildings and the laying out and construction of new streets or of the general standard of housing accommodation for working classes in the district"</p></blockquote>
That of course has served as a guide but it is not a very good guide, and it has resulted in considerable variations in different parts of the country. The Minister, quite properly, has decided that it is necessary now to give more precise guidance to a local authority to enable it to decide when a house is unfit for human habitation. Therefore, I cordially approve of the desire of the Minister. Nevertheless, we on this side of the Committee are puzzled why it is that he has not accepted the language of the Central Housing Advisory Committee. In the course of the Second Reading the Parliamentary Secretary made use of certain language in referring to this Clause 7. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Now I come to slum clearance under Part I of the Bill"</p></blockquote>
In passing, may I say that I wish that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary would not keep on saying that? There is nothing at all about slum clearance in Part I of the Bill. Part I of the Bill is about preserving slums and not clearing them; but they will go on talking in the House, in the Committee and in the country as though this was a slum clearance Bill. As a piece of public relations it is marvellous, but it. could not more lack veracity. I am certain that the Minister by now has deceived even himself. He believes that he is going down in history as the great slum clearance Minister, but in fact he is the slum preservation Minister. It is no good the hon. Gentleman groaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and I agree with him—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and a new definition was inserted in Clause 7 of the Bill which is based on the unanimous recommendation of the Central Housing Advisory Committee, which examined this question in 1946"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th November, 1953; Vol. 521, c. 804]</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never claimed that it was a reproduction of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that the hon. Gentleman did. I quoted his words. I do not know that we need be at too savage cross-purposes over this, because we are trying to improve this definition. It is not a party point. We are interested in seeing that the language used is precise and that there is no difficulty on the part of local authorities in construing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. H. Brooke) in his speech said that there was no substantial difference between the two. It seems to me that the language of the Central Housing Advisory Committee was more felicitous than the language used by the Minister. For example, the Bill speaks about freedom from damp. Actually that is an absurd use of language. We cannot have a house entirely free from damp. The Central Housing Advisory Committee, being more practically-minded, uses the words "free from serious dampness" which are much better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister say that the local authority must declare a house to be unfit for human habitation if there is any dampness? I am not making it as a debating point, but the Central Housing Advisory Committee was an important body. It consisted of ladies and gentlemen of very great experience who went into this question. In fact, I was responsible myself for asking them to make this recommendation. There was Sir Miles Mitchell, the chairman, Mr. Allerton, a person of very great experience in building work, Sir George Burt, Mr. Calverley, another experienced builder, Mr. Colin Campbell, Mr. Sydney Dilnot, Sir Arthur Hobhouse, Miss Jennie Lee, Mr. Hugh Molson, now the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works—[HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] Perhaps he has been demoted. There was also Mr. Monks, the Marchioness of Reading, Sir David Smith and Mr. J. Greenwood Wilson who was a very experienced
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>468</span>
representative of the sanitary inspectors. This Committee went into the matter at considerable length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my right hon. Friend will not count too much on the silence of the hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Wade), but he left out the one Liberal Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg his pardon; but that was a Freudian lapse. They leave themselves out so frequently that I leave them out myself. The fact is that the Committee went into this question at very considerable length. Let us look at the wording they suggested:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Act a house shall be regarded as unfit for human habitation if it is not—(i) free from serious dampness; (ii) satisfactorily lighted and ventilated; (iii) properly drained and provided with adequate sanitary conveniences and with a sink and suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water; (iv) in good general repair; and has not (v) a satisfactory water supply; (vi) adequate washing accommodation; (vii) adequate facilities for preparing and cooking food; (viii) a well ventilated store"</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that the language is modest and precise and rather better than the language now used in the Bill, because what does that say? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the house shall be deemed to be unfit as aforesaid if and only if it is so far defective in one or more of the said matters that it is not reasonably suitable for occupation in that condition"</p></blockquote>
The recommendation of the sub-committee is much better than that, because what it says is that it shall be regarded as unfit for human habitation if it is not—and then it goes on to define the conditions under which it would be unfit. I think that hon. Members would agree if they look at this question objectively that the language of the sub-committee is better than the language of the Minister. I am certain that in respect of dampness it is better than the language of the Minister because one cannot condemn every house if it has some dampness. Therefore I suggest—and I do not want to make very heavy weather of this—that the Minister might take a look at the matter again. I hope that he will not stick to what he has put in the Bill because he might find on re-examination that the language of the sub-committee is better than the language which he himself has used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

made reference to me. I should like to say a few words, because although I think that what is in the Bill now is probably right, we have a common interest in making sure that we do the best we can in this matter. It is a subject which must be very near to the hearts of all of us. We are unanimously agreed, I think, that the subsection of Section 188 of the 1936 Act is unsatisfactory. We are unanimously agreed that the words in the Bill are an improvement on that, and the right hon. Gentleman is raising the question whether they can be further improvd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like him, I was a member of the Central Housing Advisory Committee at the time when Sir Miles Mitchell's subcommittee presented its report. I think that if he casts his mind back, the right hon. Gentleman will recollect that it was Mr. Willink who appointed the Miles Mitchell sub-committee, in January, 1945.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the terms of reference were decided afterwards in this regard, but I am not sure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were appointed by the Central Housing Advisory Committee in January, 1945"</p></blockquote>
and it goes on to set out the terms of reference. However, that is a minor point. We are all agreed that the subcommittee did valuable work, and the Central Housing Advisory Committee which sat under the right hon. Gentleman's chairmanship, unanimously accepted the Report and caused it to be published. Those were in the days when I was not a Member of this House but I was possibly more acceptable to the right hon. Gentleman because I remember that afterwards he appointed me chairman of another sub-committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One further point which I want to put for consideration on this matter is this. From the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, one would have gathered that the sub-committee recommended the immediate implementation of the new standards. I think it is right—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made no such statement. I am certain that it is in the recollection of the Committee that I neither inferred nor said so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>470</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I have misunderstood the right hon. Gentleman. It might be helpful if I read the paragraph in that sub-committee's Report which follows upon the words which appear on the Order Paper in this Amendment. Having given the new conditions set out in the Amendment, the Miles Mitchell sub-committee said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While we are of the opinion that taking the country as a whole the above standard represents a reasonable minimum we consider that only the Minister of Health is in a position to decide when the right time has come to put it into force. We, therefore, recommend that any legislation which may be introduced pursuant to the preceding recommendations should provide for the revised minimum standard to take effect as from an appointed day to be fixed by the Minister"</p></blockquote>
The situation is different in two respects. It is different in that the Bill uses different words to the recommendations of the sub-committee. It is also different in that, whereas the sub-committee recommended that their new standards should come into force from some appointed day to be fixed by the Minister in the future, the Bill, as I read it, recommends and will enact that the standards laid down in Clause 7 shall come into force immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all respect, the reference by the sub-committee in speaking of the appointed day is not to the terms of art that we use here. The point is merely that the Minister himself is the person to decide when the new standards should be applied. The Minister has no power under any statute that I know to fix an appointed day. The appointed day in the mind of the sub-committee was the new legislation, and this is the new legislation. Surely, that is the only interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that, if the right hon. Gentleman would look at Clause 23 and at the sub-committee's Report, he will find that I am right and that he is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the sub-committee suggested was immediate legislation to come into force on an appointed day; what we are now considering is immediate legislation to come into force on an appointed day. If the hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. H. Brooke) will look at Clause 44 (2), he will find that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>471</span>
that is, in fact, what we are doing. I should have thought that the question when legislation should come into force was one which hardly arose on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must repeat that my reading of the Miles Mitchell Report is correct. The sub-committee recommended legislation. It stated that these new standards could not be brought into force at once, but that they should be brought into force at some future appointed day to be determined by the Minister when the Minister thought it would be practicable to enforce them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question which we have to decide today is whether there has been such a tremendous improvement in housing conditions since 1946 that we can now conscientiously declare that it is practicable to enforce these new standards. Even if there has been a very considerable improvement in the housing situation, for which we are all thankful, I am bound to say that I know countless people in my own constituency who would be very grateful if a house was to be offered to them which was fit in all other respects except that it bad not got a well ventilated food store.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain items in the Miles Mitchell Report which are still too particular and too specific in reference to the conditions of the day. It would be a mistake to legislate on lines which would indicate that houses that were fit in all respects except that one which I have mentioned were to be declared by Parliament as unfit for human habitation. That would not make sense to the ordinary housing committee of any urban local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want this new definition of unfitness which we are to put into the Bill to make sense to everybody, so that the local authorities will be given a chance to enforce it, and we shall rapidly bring all houses up to this new standard contained in Clause 7. Then it may be possible to consider future legislation to enforce at some date in the future the full standard recommended by the Miles Mitchell sub-committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will look at HANSARD for 1st December, 1953, he will find that he said that he saw no substantial difference between the Miles Mitchell standard and the standard
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>472</span>
in the Bill. I completely disagree with him, but I should like to ask him how he reconciles that statement with the speech which he has just made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no substantial difference, but there are certain specific differences. If, in fact, we are legislating on the precise lines recommended by the sub-committee, we shall not find that local authorities up and down the country consider that it is reasonable to act in accord with that new standard. It is absolutely essential, if we are to do our work and carry the local authorities with us in improving housing conditions, to make sure that both Parliament and the local authorities have a common mind about what constitutes unfitness in the present state of progress with housing accommodation. Frankly, I think it wiser at this stage to use the words in the Bill, bearing in mind that, at a future date, and I hope at an early date, it will be practicable to make them still more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one point which the hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. H. Brooke) made was about food storage. Does he consider that it would be unreasonable to ask that there should be a circulating air current in a food store? That is what is meant by a well ventilated food storage. It is impossible for food to be stored in stagnant air. All this means is that there shall be a circulating air current in a pantry. That is practicable almost everywhere, and that is much better than what is provided in the Bill which is to the effect that there shall be facilities for storing food. Everybody knows that there is all the difference in the world between a hole in the wall for storing food and food being kept fresh by the continual circulation of air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. W. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who, for a short time, was a member of the subcommittee, I should like to say that the sub-committee would have made the same comment upon this so-called standard as they did upon the one included in the 1936 Act. All these references to standards of fitness show a misuse of words. There is nothing put in here with regard to fitness. All that is provided, in trying to judge whether a house is unfit or not, is that we shall take note of various features, not the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>473</span>
condition of those things; not the condition of dampness but dampness itself; not the conditions for storage, but storage itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the committee itself said—and I would draw special attention to this—in relation to the standard in the 1936 Act, was this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It does not seek to lay down any standard as to what constitutes a house fit for habitation, but merely enjoins that in judging a house regard is to be had to the extent to which it fails short of various requirements"</p></blockquote>
Then, in Paragraph 14, the Report goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We feel that the efforts which until the war temporarily stopped progress were being made to improve housing conditions and to raise housing standards may to some extent have suffered because of the negative character of the minimum penal standard laid down in the Housing Act, 1936"</p></blockquote>
What we want here is that there should be adequate support and suggestions given to the local authorities concerned that the standard shall be a real minimum standard to which houses should be made to conform. That is better than merely saying to them that, in judging whether a house is unfit or not, they should look at certain features. To lay down all the things that are to be taken into consideration, and to say that, unless it is found that a house falls short of something here set out, it has to be regarded as fit, seems to me not to be laying down a general standard at all, but merely to be persisting in the negative attitude of the 1936 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed with the speech of the right hon. Gentleman in regard to the point made by my hon. Friend. I think we are all now agreed that here we are taking a forward step to write into the statute something which shall give greater definition to what may be regarded as unfitness. My own view is that we have gone certainly as far as it is safe to go at present; indeed, I think it may well be that, for the time being, we have gone too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention was put to me very vividly by my own town clerk, who came to London yesterday to discuss the matter with me. It arises more particularly on subsections (1) and (2), and relates to the question of back-to-back houses which are very numerous in my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>474</span>
part of the world. It is certainly open to argument whether, if we lay down some definite standard in subsection (1), we ought to preserve in perpetuity an automatic standard that any back-to-back house is, 	<i>ipso facto,</i> unfit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my part of the world many of them are structurally superior and might be made suitable at less expense—I am glad to have some indication of assent from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan). But if we are discussing subsection (1), and for the first time attempting definition, it is certainly worth consideration whether some of the rather 	<i>ad hoc</i> limitations which are now in the statute should not be deleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is to controvert, if I may do so with great respect, what has been said by the right hon. Member for Poplar (Mr. Key). The difference between the Amendment and the Bill is not solely or most importantly the kind of difference to which my right hon. Friend drew attention. If the Amendment were passed we should have the absolutely rigid position that any house not conforming to the specific condition, 	<i>ipso facto,</i> is valueless, must be pulled down and only site value paid. Of course, that would not happen. Local authorities are finding it difficult enough at present even to take the steps—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the point of this definition is not necessarily to secure demolition, but to secure that the house has to be brought up to that condition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may intervene about the back-to-back houses. I may have been misunderstood when I nodded my head. I know of a number of cases where a passage way has been made from the front house to the rear house and both houses converted into one. One of the reasons which led me to the Act of 1949 was precisely those rows of houses in some of the older industrial parts of Great Britain, where the houses are quite substantial. If a house were taken down here and there, so as to get rid of monotony and give rear access and a passageway, very many could be converted into good houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much between us, but I think that my point is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>475</span>
valid. Once we start putting into the statute for the first time some specification of what constitutes unfitness, it is by no means certain—and I put it no higher than that but submit it for the Minister's attention—that it would be wise to take out purely 	<i>ad hoc</i> definitions which have been in the statute for a long time, and which it is arguable are out of date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I want to stress—which I think answers the point of the interjection—is that we should not merely have simple definitions of what is unfit, but that we should do something about it. It is no accusation against local authorities but simply a statement of fact, to say that up and down the country there are houses which would be declared unfit were it possible to do anything about it. We do not want to write into the statute some bogus definition which, because it would be so obviously unfair to the owner due to its implications as to site value, would lead local authorities not to use their powers. Is it not much better to put in, as the Minister suggests, something of this kind, which is a definite advance but sufficiently elastic for us to hope that local authorities would use it, rather than have a beautiful definition in the statute and do nothing about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the argument which we have just heard I understand that in laying down some standard of fitness we are going further than public opinion would allow or local authorities operate. I do not believe that. Certainly the Mitchell sub-committee recommended that these standards should be laid down as a minimum. At the bottom of page 8 of the Report it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think that the time has come when the standard instead of being merely a standard for guidance might be prescribed by law as a minimum"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member also read paragraph 24?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is said that we are going too far because there is no published report, but this is the Report of a committee of men widely knowledgeable on housing. They had evidence from all the municipal associations and the Land Agents' Society and unanimously recommended that those standards should be laid down by law as a minimum. And the Central Housing Advisory Committee
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>476</span>
unanimously accepted that recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that all local authorities who have had to handle the housing legislation have been looking for years for a better definition of slum housing than is contained in the 1936 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree that it came before the Central Housing Advisory Committee, but the Report which came before that Committee also contained paragraph 24 which said that it could not be brought into operation in the present circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member will not keep on talking about that, because there could not be a sillier point. We are at the moment discussing the appointed day. In Clause 44 (2), to which my hon. and learned Friend called attention, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Act shall come into operation on the expiration of the period of one month beginning with the date on which it is passed"</p></blockquote>
That is the appointed date, and that is what we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 24 also says that the sub-committee recommend legislation. Our objection is that the Clause tones down the recommendation of the Central Housing Advisory Committee. It will lay down for local authorities a standard not only lower than that which the Central Advisory Committee adopted, but lower than that generally accepted by knowledgeable people in local government service. Paragraph (c) of this Amendment says that a house shall be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"properly drained and provided with adequate sanitary conveniences…"</p></blockquote>
I have recently had experience of how difficult the law is to administer on that basis. In my constituency I have a group of houses which were built many years ago on an old stable yard. I got complaints about dampness and discovered that whenever it rains hard the houses in that quadrangle flood, because the sewers flow back. I found that a manhole to the sewers was underneath the floor of the front room of one of the cottages. When I said that the property was obviously unfit to live in I was told that it was impossible for the local authority to condemn it as a slum. I would have pulled it down immediately; yet people are still
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>477</span>
living in it though the place is not merely damp but suffers from the "serious dampness" referred to in the Amendment. If such a place cannot be dealt with by law as a slum it is time the law was altered, and if the law is to be altered it might as well be done properly on lines suggested by knowledgeable people who gave long consideration to this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to paragraph (	<i>b</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfactorily lighted and ventilated;"</p></blockquote>
I was amazed at the suggestion that a house is suitable if, while not having this amenity, it has all the other good things I should have thought it most important. Millions of pounds' worth of food must be wasted each year because it is put in damp, airless cupboards which were never intended to be pantries. Anyone owning property 80, 90 or 100 years old—as so much of it is in London—knows that often the so-called pantry or larder in a house is damp and lacks air. Bread goes mouldy, meat goes bad and food generally is spoiled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one of the essentials of good housing, but all the Clause says is that there shall be
	<br><blockquote><p>"… facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food…."</p></blockquote>
As my right hon. Friend has said, food can be stored in a hole in the wall but it may be completely wrong to put food inside such a place. The storage space ought to be well ventilated and, if possible on the north wall. In that way food is kept fit and waste is avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Houses lacking such facilities ought to be brought up to these standards. That is what we are trying to ensure. Many houses are so structurally sound that it costs almost as much to pull them down as to rebuild them, but they have all the other facilities mentioned in the Clause. Though some could be improved at very considerable expense, a great many could not be improved at any reasonable expense. They ought to be classified as slums and pulled down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree that in this Amendment we are really trying to help him. He has introduced the standard of fitness which is very much better than that in the 1936 Act, but it is still very vague in many respects. It leaves an enormous field for argument.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>478</span>
It gives an opportunity for legal representatives at slum clearance inquiries to argue for hours and days. I do not think they could argue about the Amendment. We should have a definition which is understandable and which is backed by the authoritative recommendation of the very knowledgeable sub-committee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee. That should be put into the Bill so that the local authorities will know exactly where they stand regarding standards of fitness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman at one point said that he did not wish to deal with this question in any partisan or attacking spirit, but in a spirit of mild and moderate contemplation. He went on to accuse me of being chiefly devoted to preserving slums; but that is part of the infinite variety of his character—one moment all sun and smiles, and the next all storm. To adapt the quotation, "Age cannot wither him, nor custom stale his infinite variety" Or, if one might use the expressive words of an old friend of all of us, who was lately honoured:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I called him a pig-faced baboon and a thief.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>He suddenly struck me. It passes belief"</p></blockquote>
To leave these divergencies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And to facilitate the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful discussion, but perhaps there has been some degree of confusion as to what it is that we are trying to do in the Bill. Hon. Members opposite have been good enough to admit that we are trying to make an advance on the definition in Section 188 of the Housing Act, 1936. What we have done is to take broadly, with very minor amendments, the suggested standard laid down by the Miles Mitchell Committee. I will be absolutely frank with the Committee and say that we do not think that it is practicable at this moment to make it an enforceable standard in the form in which the proposed Amendment would do. The Amendment would say that, under the eight conditions of the Miles Mitchell
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>479</span>
Report, a house must be regarded as unfit if it does not comply with all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that there will be a time when all that the Amendment wants to do would be reasonable to do. But I do not believe that hon. Members opposite, either from their administrative experience or from their experiences in their own constituencies, could believe that if we accepted the Amendment as it stands it would be anything except an inoperative provision, because it would be impossible to put it into operation in a very large number of towns, and even in country districts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman suggest that the standard laid down in every Act of Parliament is always operated automatically by the local authority? Is it not the practice of local authorities to operate standards and even statutes in a flexible way in the light of conditions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so. It may be necessary occasionally to drive a small vehicle through an Act of Parliament, but this is very different. To say that nothing but a great series of coaches and horses can ever proceed through the provisions seems unnecessary and foolish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Amendment were adopted, the house would be declared unfit if it did not satisfy all of these conditions. We have in essence the same list of conditions in the Bill, but we say frankly that we shall not declare that a house is unfit if it does not satisfy every item in the list. It should be deemed unfit
	<br><blockquote><p>"… if and only if it is so far defective in one or more of the said matters that it is not reasonably suitable for occupation in that condition"</p></blockquote>
That is a weaker standard than that pro-provided in the Amendment, not in the definition of standard, but in the operation of it. It is no good pretending that it is not, but much as I would sympathise with the desire to make the thing some day reasonably enforceable I do not think that it can be done at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, we have been told that we have been too bold in putting forward Clause 7 at all, that we might have rested on existing conditions, and that we might create considerable difficulty even with the attempt which we are making here. But I thought that it was worth taking the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>480</span>
risk. One would insist upon these conditions in a new house, of course, but in these cases we should not say that because a house was defective in one of these conditions it was necessarily unfit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to get this definition into the Bill and have attention concentrated on it. We thought a good deal before risking Clause 7. It might have been much easier to rest it on the old Section. We tried to get substantially what the Miles Mitchell Committee recommended, but not to get what is impracticable at the moment. Rather, we have said, "These are matters which, of course, will be required for new accommodation and will be held up as the general standard but which could not be honestly and sincerely enforced in conditions at the present time"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I ought not to have ventured on this advance at all. It might have been easier to have left the matter where it has been left since 1946, because there has not been the faintest effort to move forward. However, we have laid down a general form which can become both the standard and an effective measure and guidance for those who have to operate the provisions of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened very carefully to the Minister's reply and I hope that he will not take it unduly hardly if I say that I am not at all satisfied with it. I do not think that he quite appreciates yet that these houses will be used for the purpose of occupation for a fairly considerable time. Although the right hon. Gentleman, after a considerable amount of pressure, conceded the point which I was trying to make during a previous discussion—that it would not be fair for a tenant to be expected to remain in a house adjoining a neighbour if that neighbour had been given a new house under these conditions—he said that he would indicate that some consideration should be given to the claim of a tenant of that nature for a new house. Nevertheless, all this means that in some circumstances somebody will be accommodated in a house which ought to be demolished but which in consequence of this new venture will be patched up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the fundamental point of the whole matter. It is no use saying that the provisions of the 1936 Act have prevailed since 1946 because this proposal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>481</span>
is an entirely new thing. It is now intended to patch up houses which ought to be demolished and consequently will be used in spite of the fact that they should have been demolished. The hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. H. Brooke) is, to say the least of it, a little illogical in his apologia—and it was an apologia—for not following the lines which he indicated were the proper lines as far back as 1945.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of fact, 1919.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to go back to the Committee of which the hon. Member for Hampstead was a member and no further, because that is in itself sufficient for my purpose. I am referring to the Standards of Fitness for Habitation Sub-Committee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not sit on that sub-committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member sat on the main Committee, which from his point of view makes it worse still and from my point of view better still, because the hon. Member did not produce a minority report. He said, "We unanimously agreed"—for that is what it amounts to—after long deliberation. It was no over-night thought. When the Committee had every facility at its disposal for examining the position thoroughly and accurately, the hon. Member did not differ from the conclusions of his fellow-investigators. On the contrary, he said that the principal Act of 1936 had a provision which was scandalous and must be remedied, because if it were not remedied it would not be playing fair with the people who were living in the houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Report of the Committee states. Now the hon. Member says, "Of course I did not mean that. What I meant was that perhaps in the year 2010 an occasion might arise when this kind of fitness condition would become useful" The hon. Member cannot get away with that. I am sure that on reflection he will agree that what he is saying now is not a fair interpretation of what he thought at that time, and no matter how much he wants to help the Minister at the moment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>482</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to help the Minister so much as help the people who are living in these circumstances. I have never changed from my opinion that the Miles Mitchell standard should come into force at the earliest day that is practicable, and that is precisely what the Committee said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, it did not. What was said by the Miles Mitchell Committee was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think that the time has come when the standard instead of being merely a standard for guidance might he prescribed by law as a minimum"</p></blockquote>
It is perfectly true that in the paragraph to which the hon. Member for Hampstead referred there were the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… we consider that only the (Minister of Health is in a position to decide when the right time has come to put it into force"</p></blockquote>
But, of course, it is nonsense to say that that meant years ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member wants to rely on that paragraph he should read on. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We, therefore, recommend that any legislation which may toe introduced pursuant to the preceding recommendation"—</p></blockquote>
that recommendation set up the standard—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should provide for the revised minimum standard to take effect as from an appointed day to toe fixed by the Minister"</p></blockquote>
I understand that that would mean—and it is a possible way which I would even consider—that we could fix the standard and then say that we do not want it to come into effect in the Bill but that the Bill will give the right to the Minister to bring it into effect on an appointed day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not it at all. It is no use talking about that. The Minister knows that he is dealing with housing repairs and that in fact the Housing Act, 1936, is the principal Act with which this Bill is concerned. Therefore, as that Act is now the principal Act, the right hon. Gentleman is introducing a fresh Bill which complies entirely with what the Miles Mitchell Committee had in mind. In other words, what the Miles Mitchell Committee were saying was, "When you next deal with the Housing Acts, take this into consideration" We are dealing with a Housing Act, because the 1936 Act is the principal Act in connection with this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>483</span>
We on this side of the Committee now say, "The time has come, and it is very belated already, when proper consideration should be given to the recommendations of this Committee, consisting of thoroughly respectable and responsible people who had every possibility of coming to a correct solution" The Minister in answer to that says, "But it does not matter. Although that Committee came to the conclusion that this should be set as a fixed standard, let us leave it to the councils"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we know already, very many local authorities, having had a great deal left to them, have allowed landlords to let their houses go into decay, although they have been paid rents to enable them to do repairs. If it had not been for that, the millions of houses in this country which today are in a very bad condition would never have come into that condition. If the sanitary inspectors had been sent by the local authorities to see to it that these houses were fit for habitation, there would be very few slum houses unfit for habitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill admits that there are very many houses in this country which are unfit for habitation, and we know very well that people are living in them. Therefore, when we come to place these houses in a state which we can ask human beings to accept as meaning that they are fit for habitation, we have to fix a standard. That is my personal opinion. We cannot allow the matter to rest on the opinions of any particular authority or of any particular landlord; we have to decide upon something tangible, so that human beings shall not be asked to live under conditions which are less than the minimum which the Mitchell Committee considered to be essential for the health of the people and for the ordinary purposes of habitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough to say that this is a guide, or that some of these things can be taken. That is what the Minister is saying. He says that some of them will be taken into consideration. One hon. Member—I think the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin)—said that the Minister was much too generous. Let him go to his constituents who are living in houses which are unfit to live in—because that is what we are dealing with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>484</span>
—and ask them whether they are content to continue under those or similar conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member has referred to me, may I ask whether I am correct in understanding his argument to be that in any subsequent Amendments to the principal Act this matter should be deat with, and that that is why it should be dealt with now? In that case, why was not it dealt with in the 1949 Housing Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we were not patching up houses. I do not remember the hon. Member himself raising the point. I do not know whether he was here to raise it, either directly or indirectly. At present, however, we are dealing with a Bill which relates to the Housing Act, and I say that the time has come, when we are asking people to occupy houses which are to be patched up, to ensure that those people are definitely given the protection for which we ask in this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has twice referred to this matter as though it applied to patched houses. It should be made clear that this Clause has nothing to do with patched houses. It is in fact a standard for houses which are in the second class.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is really not correct. I admit that it is a secondary connection, but surely there is a connection. There are houses which have to be patched up and houses which will be condemned. In order to determine whether a house shall be condemned the Minister suggests certain standards, so that there is a definite connection between patching up a condemned house and the standards on which the house is to be condemned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is something in the point which the right hon. Gentleman is making, but, after all, we are discussing Clause 7, and over and over again the hon. Member has referred to these being the standards up to which the patched houses should be brought. That has been said at least twice by the hon. Gentleman. As long as he understands that what he says is not the case, I am content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is the case. We have to take the Bill as a whole when dealing with any specified part of it, and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>485</span>
as my right hon. Friend has said, we cannot dissociate one part from another. Let me finish dealing with this point. The question, in the circumstances, is whether a person shall be required to live in a house of a certain standard, whether it be for patching or otherwise. My statement, and my categorical statement, is that there must be a definite standard, and that a person should not be called upon to live in conditions which are below that standard. There must be a rigid standard to which he can refer and to which everybody else can refer. In those circumstances, I think that the Minister might reconsider his position on the matter and move towards an acceptance of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. E. Mott-Radclyffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I think divides the two sides of the Committee is simply the question of what is and what is not in present circumstances a practicable standard of habitation. I want to say a word about this question in relation to the more remote rural areas. I agree that what is really required is a standard which first of all is practicable in rural areas, and secondly which is capable of easy interpretation, and thirdly which gives the local authorities some latitude in carrying it out. It is not the slightest use trying to pitch the standard so high that it puts the local authorities in a completely impossible position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the best will in the world, the Amendment which is before us does pitch it too high. I very much doubt whether quite a number of the older type of council houses themselves would fulfil all the qualifications in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>h</i>) of the Amendment. I am certain that a large number of rural cottages would not do so. For instance, what does paragraph (c) mean? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"properly drained and provided with adequate sanitary conveniences and with a sink and suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water"</p></blockquote>
Does that mean a piped water supply? If it means a piped water supply, hon. Members opposite know perfectly well that there are very large numbers of houses, both council and privately owned, which are not within miles of a main water piped line. If paragraph (c) means a piped water supply, it is completely and absolutely impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that point only in order to emphasise that it is extremely important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>
that there should not be any vague interpretation of what the standard is, and secondly that it should be a standard which any local authority, be it urban or rural, can really achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to call the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that the language used by the Mitchell Committee in 1946 is almost the same language as was used in 1938 in the Rural Housing Manual issued by the Ministry of Health. That language was almost identical with the language used in 1919, so that what some hon. Members are now suggesting is that we ought not to write into a Bill in 1954 a standard of fitness which was in fact originally laid down in 1919.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mott-Radclyffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I am saying is that it is not the slightest use trying to write into any Act of Parliament—and the right hon. Gentleman himself did not do so in the 1948 Act—a standard of fitness which in fact poses a problem which local authorities cannot conceivably solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe, Sir Gordon, that you did suggest that we should discuss the next Amendment at the same time as this one. I would direct the attention of the Committee to it. In passing, I would say that I am surprised that the hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Mott-Radclyffe) who was referring, apparently, in particular to rural problems, should not have been aware that the standard which we have been discussing in the main Amendment before us was laid down in the Rural Housing Manual. I should have thought that by now it would have been acceptable as a proper minimum standard to be achieved. It is certainly not a standard which, in our view, puts the sights too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment to include heating, which I have put down on the Order Paper, was put down merely to inquire from the Minister what his views were. Frankly, it is not an Amendment which I would propose to press, but I think we ought to realise that we must seize every opportunity to try to improve the heating facilities in houses of all kinds, old houses and new, because of our realisation of the very serious problems both of the conservation of fuel and also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>487</span>
of smoke abatement. It seemed to, me, therefore, that we should pay some attention to the importance of securing proper heating appliances even in old houses, as one way of trying to tackle the very much wider problems of smoke in our cities and the saving of fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that it would be better to insert a proposal of this kind later on in the Bill, when we come to discuss the standards which landlords have to maintain in order to attract higher rents, but it seemed to me that the Minister should express to the Committee his views about the essential need of having the highest standard of heating appliance in all homes. We recognise that this is one of our main difficulties at the present time. I hope that the Minister will find it possible to say something at this stage, therefore, about what his views are on this, and whether he feels that it is possible to lay down, either here or at a later stage in the Bill, requirements about the proper provision of heating appliances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know, for example, that so far as new local authority housing is concerned, provision is made that approved types of heating appliance must be included in the houses if they are to be approved by the Minister. That is one step forward, though many people consider that it is not a sufficiently big step to take. I am asking the Minister, however, whether he does not accept the necessity of tackling also the problem of the old houses, which obviously must make the biggest contribution of all to the general smoke problem in our cities. I shall be glad if he can make some comments on this general point, as it will influence many of us in regard to proposals which we might wish to make at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may have been discourteous on my part not to have referred to this matter earlier, as the two Amendments are being discussed together. It must be remembered that this is what the sub-committee called a penal standard, a standard which, if the house does not reach it, the landlord can be forced to spend money to attain, and, if he does not do that, the house can be taken away from him and no payment made. Whether it would be right to introduce heating into some other standard might
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>488</span>
be considered, but I should have thought that, since the sub-committee did not deal with it, it would not do, in this minimum or penal standard, to introduce considerations which, however valuable they may be, do not seem to come into this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman agree to look into the matter at a later stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. Can we now reach a decision on this matter? We have had a very long discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important Clause. A number of hon. Members opposite have spoken on it, and I see that another wishes to speak now. I do not think that the Minister can say that he is being particularly helpful on this matter this morning, and I am very disappointed indeed. I was hoping that he would be able to say that he would have a look at the position, because some of us consider the drafting of the Clause to be exceedingly bad. Not only does it not come up to the standards of the Mitchell Committee, but it is a badly drafted Clause, and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) wishes to call the attention of the Committee to that aspect of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to press the Committee unduly, but since we are speaking about drafting I should like to point out that this Amendment would have the effect that the house would have to be defective in all the respects listed before it could be declared unfit. That is the actual legal reading of the Amendment, and if we are to discuss drafting I would just make that observation. That, however, is a purely verbal matter. I do not want to press the Committee unduly, but I should have thought that the Committee might reach a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Granville West</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the opinion that the right hon. Gentleman has expressed that of the Law Officers of the Crown?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The attitude of the Government side of the Committee on this matter is most disappointing, but I suppose it lis in line with what we have heard upon every suggestion for improving the general standards of housing, and, indeed, of other social matters. We are always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1953-1954V002P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>489</span>
told that this proposal is going too far, that it is premature, too rigid, and that now is not the time. I have heard that throughout the whole of my local government and Parliamentary life from the party on the other side of the Committee. I did think that the Minister, in view of his zeal in this great campaign which he is launching through the instrument of this Bill, would give a lead towards a higher and better standard of housing in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather shocked when he told us this morning of his proposals with regard to Clause 7, that he was taking a plunge and a risk. I suppose the Minister really desires, as far as he can, to bring about a general raising of the standards, particularly in the older houses—those houses which at the present time have very few amenities. One would have thought that he would have done something better than what is proposed in the Bill. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan), the previous Minister, has said, this falls far short of the standard suggested by the Ministry of Health in 1919, 30 years ago. At that time the Ministry of Health put UP for the guidance of the local housing authorities a list of conditions at which they should aim to. bring about in houses occupied by members of the working class, to use the phrase of the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be aware of that standard, and the Mitchell Report which has been quoted this morning sets out the standard which the Ministry of Health suggested 30 years ago. But the Minister has evidently decided that the standard which was set 30 years ago is now too high for his Bill. It is lamentable that at this time the Minister in charge of the housing of this country cannot bring himself to set a standard higher than that suggested by the Government 30 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. H. Brooke), I thought, attempted to deal fairly with the proposals made by the Mitchell Committee, but he ignored or conveniently overlooked the essential point of the proposals. The Committee suggested that there should be inserted in the next housing Bill a new standard for the guidance of local authorities. I would draw the attention of the hon. Member for Hampstead to the point that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>490</span>
the Mitchell Committee laid down standards which they put in paragraph 23 of their Report stating specifically that these, in their opinion, were the minimum standards. The Minister has not only rejected the minimum standards laid down by the Mitchell Committee, but has declined to come up to the level suggested by the Ministry of Health as long ago as 1919.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister does not really believe that the Amendment, in some form if not in its exact form, would in practice prevent local authorities from applying the Bill and working towards a higher standard. He must know very well that in all these matters the local authority is not only necessarily guided by the words of the statute, but it applies the statute in the circumstances and difficulties of any particular period. I am sure that he would have been rewarded not only in the estimation of himself and that of the local authorities, but by some progress in housing if he had taken the plunge and had encouraged local authorities to look to something higher than we have had before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of that he has reverted to a standard lower than was suggested over 30 years ago. To that extent I think that on this essential point in the Bill he has failed to come up to the expectations that many of us had in his zeal for better housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Eveline Hill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to the Amendment standing in the name of myself and my two hon. Friends in page 7, line 6. We have heard a good deal about the Committee over which Sir Miles Mitchell presided. As he is a member of my local authority, it will be realised that we in Manchester are alert to the necessity of minimum standards. But in the Bill itself there is no suggestion whatever of any provision for adequate washing accommodation. It is referred to in the provisos under the Mitchell Report, but there is not in the Bill any specific mention even of a sink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In paragraph (	<i>g</i>) we see the words "drainage and sanitary conveniences," but there is no suggestion of adequate washing facilities. While it will not be possible in all houses to have a completely separate washing place—an extra scullery—at least we want to be sure that we have a deep sink and facilities for washing within the house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. A. Wilkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to refer to a similar point to that which the hon. Lady has just mentioned. I wonder whether at this stage we might make an appeal to the Minister to be a little forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have listened to the debate I have been sorry to see that we are seemingly divided on some very narrow points. Indeed, I would suggest that it is mainly on matters of definition. I was interested in the observations of the hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Mott-Radclyffe) who called our attention to paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of our Amendment on the Order Paper, and asked whether in that proposal we included an adequate water supply. He complained that that paragraph was vague. Of course, in fact, it is paragraph (	<i>e</i>) which suggests a satisfactory water supply. I suppose that in the case of a country area such as he referred to, a good well supply would be regarded as a satisfactory supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I wanted to say about the remarks of the hon. Member for Windsor is that I think that the term "vague" applies to all the proposals in Clause 7. That is our major complaint against these proposals. They are, indeed, vague, and when we separate the terms, which we have done in this Amendment, and make a comparison between the Amendment and the (provisions of the Clause, we realise how vague those terms are. For example, we say, "in good general repair," but in the Bill it simply states</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If that is so then why not try to make this the best practical standard. That is where I find myself in disagreement. The truth is that the standard in the Bill is too vague. I was speaking only a few days ago to our chief sanitary inspector and he told me of the enormous field of disagreement in one item alone, namely, the question of what is dampness and what is serious dampness.

I submit to the Committee that these Mitchell standards are more definite than the rather vague standards which we have already in the Bill.

	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 24; Noes, 18.</p>
	<p>indeed, and the Minister made a very short speech in reply. That is all that has been said about these Amendments. Therefore, Sir Gordon, if you take the view which you have expressed that no further debate is possible, then it will be necessary to move the Closure on these Amendments. The Closure can be moved only on an Amendment which is before the Committee. It cannot be applied to all three of these Amendments. If we are not to have any discussion on the other two, it will be necessary to move the Closure.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paget</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the position is this. We can only have one debate; that is, the three Amendments can only be debated once, but, in the middle of that one debate, if the Motion is moved "That the Question be now put," as to the first Amendment, the carrying of that Motion means that the first Amendment is thereby disposed of. That does not bring the debate to an end. The debate can come to an end only when the Question is put on the three Amendments; that is to say, when three Questions are put. Each of them would have to be subject to the Closure Motion in turn before each single debate is brought to an end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my view, the Committee agreed to debate all three Amendments on the Question relating to the first, and the hon. and learned Gentleman knows that there cannot be further debate now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As a result of this Ruling, which we must accept, we must in future resist any proposal that Amendments should be taken together if that means that they cannot be considered adequately. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, we have on several occasions ourselves made suggestions that certain Amendments should be grouped for the purposes of discussion, but it is extremely discourteous, it seems to me, to prevent discussion upon Amendments which have hardly been mentioned at all.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. H.

Members can preserve their rights to vote upon each of them, but they may not be discussed. I do not think that anyone can say that the time we have given to this group of Amendments has not been fairly long. While I do not want to do anything to alter the traditional system by which the work of the House is carried out, and though it would give the right to hon. Members to vote upon them, it would not be right to discuss the other Amendments again after one debate has covered all three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that three Amendments which are being considered together cannot be moved at the same time? I submit, therefore, that when the Question was put, it could only refer to the Amendment which has been moved, because no Question could be put in regard to the other Amendments which have not been moved. Therefore, the discussion cannot thereby be brought to a stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any discussion of the second Amendment would be completely out of order.

These two points, which the local authorities wish to raise, can be dealt with very shortly. The words which it is suggested should be left out are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the house shall be deemed to be unfit as aforesaid if and only if it is so far defective in one or more of the said matters that it is not reasonably suitable for occupation in that condition"</p></blockquote>
Many local government lawyers and other legal people throughout the country who are responsible for defending the actions of the local authorities before the courts feel that considerable difficulties and disputes may arise when the Bill becomes law. The reason for the suggested omission is that there should be no doubt whatever as to the standard of fitness. It is understood, that, in the view of the Minister this Clause, while containing a comprehensive list of matters to which local authorities are to have regard, is intended to enable them to say that a house is unfit because of the cumulative effect of minor defects under a number of heads, as well as the effect of a major defect under one head.

It might be held that dampness was not, in itself, sufficient to make a house unfit for human habitation, or that the items from (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>h</i>) might, in themselves, individually not be sufficient to warrant the house being considered unfit for human habitation. The local authorities are worried about that and want all ambiguity taken away. They want it made abundantly clear that in the case of each one of the items not being, in itself, a cause for the house to be dealt with, together they would constitute a house unfit for human habitation. The local authorities' advisers consider that the words from line 7 to 9 could be, or might be, construed by a county court judge as limiting it to the one cause—each cause having to be established. If the Minister, on the advice he has received, can say that, as it stands, that is clearly not so, it would be unnecessary for me to pursue this Amendment. On the other hand, the local authorities' feelings on this problem should be on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose which my hon. Friend, and the Association of Municipal Corporations with whom, I think, he has been consulting, has in mind in making the Amendment and my purpose is precisely the same. It is that a number of defects, none of them by itself decisive, can be taken together to make a house unsuitable for human habitation. In other words, a number of smaller defects, none of which separately might be decisive, would cumulatively be a cause for deciding that a house was unfit. That is what he wants and that is what we want. I am advised that that is what those words do. I will, of course, consult again, with the Law Officers of the Crown if need be—or if I may be allowed such a le	<i>se majeste</i> with so many lawyers about, more effectively consult with the draftsmen to make sure either that those words mean what we want, and what my hon. Friend wants, or that the wording upon Report stage makes it clear beyond a peradventure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I tenatively share the view which the Minister has just expressed—and from that point of view the Amendment is somewhat unnecessary—in another way I am rather disposed to support it. I should still prefer, however, the alternative in the next few Amendments. Nevertheless, we have had so very few concessions from the Minister during the course of this Bill that one feels inclined to say better half a loaf than no bread.

The Amendment rather appeals to me, because this so-called definition is no definition at all. Subsection (1) says that we have to have regard to certain things, but that does not take us much further by way of definition. Then we have to see for what purpose we must have regard to them. That purpose is to limit the plain, ordinary question of fact of whether a house is reasonably suitable for human habitation to another question of whether it is reasonably suitable by reason of one or more of these matters.

If I read the Clause correctly it comes to this. A house can be not reasonably suitable for occupation at all. One would have thought that an unfit house. But it is not an unfit house unless its unsuitability for occupation happens to arise from one of these matters. That is a most extraordinary and thoroughly reactionary doctrine. I was unable to express my objection on a previous Amendment because of the Closure—without which we seem unable to have a division in this Committee—but, apart from the alternative presented by the Mitchell Committee, this Committee ought to consider very carefully whether this subsection, without anything else in it, ought to be allowed to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make myself perfectly clear and to have no misunderstanding about this. A house may, as a matter of fact, be not reasonably suitable for occupation. What we are going to put into the Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
as I see it, is a provision that such a house will only be said to be unfit for human habitation if its unsuitability happens to come from the list that has been prepared. Really, we are taking too much upon ourselves. We cannot, and no one ought to try to, state completely the reasons for which a house may be unsuitable for occupation; yet that is exactly what we are trying to do. If the last three lines of the subsection are to be omitted, as the Amendment proposes, we shall certainly have omitted that dangerous and reactionary limitation and have it left that we must have regard to a number of considerations, and no more.
