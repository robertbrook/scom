	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would serve the convenience of the Committee if we discussed with this Amendment the next Amendment on the Order Paper, in the name of the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin), in page 6, line 14, to leave out paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (c).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simmons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am here seeking some clarification of the purpose of this sub-section, which I admit it is difficult to grasp. We have had the week-end to examine it but I am still befogged. At the last sitting of the Committee even that high legal luminary the Attorney-General said it was difficult to keep one's mind clear when examining the various provisions of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where apart from this subsection a payment would be payable by virtue of this section …"</p></blockquote>
That confuses me. I do not understand how, "apart from" can be "by virtue of." Such qualifications befog the lay man. Does it mean that the subsection qualifies the Clause or is apart from it? Apparently, paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) of subsection (5) have the virtue mentioned in line 6 of the subsection. But just how virtuous are they? Or is all the virtue in the Clause itself, and, if so, what is the purpose of paragraphs (a), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Attorney-General said at our last sitting, this is rather complicated language, and I should like some clarification. Perhaps the Attorney-General would quote some cases to illustrate the effect of (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (c). That would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1236</span>
useful, because anything which removes doubt is worth having, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman has himself said. I am sure that the majority of hon. Members are "doubting Thomases"—and I mean no reflection on the Chair. I hope that the Attorney-General will be able to deal explicitly with the purpose of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>), and not say, as he did at the last sitting, that it will be all right so long as the experts can work it out. We laymen wish to try to work it out for ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point on which I think we need some enlightenment. It is quite a simple point, and I do not expect the Attorney-General to reply with a despairing "We do not know" or put a wet towel round his head in order to work out the reply. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee detest dictators. In this Clause we are giving to the Central Land Board the right to refuse or to disallow a claim, not by virtue of anything in the Bill but in a way which the Board may determine to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should not be much difficulty about qualifying that right, because the Bill is full of qualifying words, and an extra one will not make very much difference. Here the right is vested in the Central Land Board to allow or disallow payment, and it can determine what deduction is appropriate. We do not know what is the yardstick the Board will use or by what standard it will judge, and I can find no reference to that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise that I am asking for enlightenment on this most important point, both as regards equity and justice, and from the point of view of democratic procedure. The bureaucrat should not be allowed to have the last word. Can the Minister or the Attorney-General define the position? Can we be told that the Land Board must give reasons for its decisions, and that there will be a right of appeal? If we cannot have those assurances the position is monstrous; and, if we can, I suggest that the position should be made clear in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General (Sir Lionel Heald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Simmons) for putting his inquiries about this Clause so clearly. Perhaps I may start by dealing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1237</span>
with his last point, which is very important. I can say definitely that it is intended—Amendments will be moved later with regard to this matter—that the power of the Central Land Board to exercise its discretion shall be subject to appeal to the Lands Tribunal. In addition, I shall be able, in a few minutes, to make it clear why it is necessary that the Board should have that discretion. There will be some complicated cases where only part of a development charge payment comes into question, or where only part of the land comes into question. It is not possible to lay down any mathematical or arithmetical rules, and the Board will have to make the necessary adjustment. I think that the hon. Member's point will be safeguarded by the right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the Clause as a whole, the key to it is this. As one can see, by reference to the marginal note on page 5 of the Bill, this Clause deals with a case where provision has to be made for payment where there has been development charge incurred by a claim-holder or his predecessor in title. In certain circumstances that would result in a man getting paid too much. That is why, when we come to subsection (5), it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where apart from this subsection"—</p></blockquote>
that means to say if subsection (5) was not there—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a payment would be payable by virtue of this section by reference to a development charge, and by reason of the payment of that charge"—</p></blockquote>
certain things happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then provision will be made for the Central Land Board to
	<br><blockquote><p>"reduce or disallow the payment as the Board may determine to be appropriate…."</p></blockquote>
This machinery will prevent a man receiving more than he should. One has to go back to the 1947 Act as it stands before amendment. (Under Section 22 of that Act provision is made for the case where planning permission is revoked or modified. If that is done no compensation is payable in respect of depreciation of the value of the owner's interest unless development charge has been paid in connection with the permission, or, under Part VIII of the 1947 Act, none is payable at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If development charge has been paid then, under Section 22 of the 1947 Act,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1238</span>
the owner will have received compensation in full for the whole of the damage to his interest. That damage will include the money he paid out in development charge, which was wasted because he could not take advantage of it. In that case the owner will already have, in effect, received back the development charge, and if he gets it again under this Clause he will be getting it twice over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore we say that this is a case where, apart from this subsection, the owner would get X plus Y We do not wish him to have Y so we have to make provision for Y being taken away, and this is the way that is done. Therefore, paragraph (	<i>a</i>) deals with the case which I have already mentioned, where a man has already received the equivalent of his development charge back by virtue of Section 22 of the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) deal with different cases. They deal with a case where the land in respect of which development charge has been paid has been compulsorily acquired or sold under the threat or shadow of compulsory purchase powers. Exactly the same point arises there because, under Part V of the 1947 Act, when an interest in land was compulsorily acquired the compensation payable disregarded any value attributable to the grant of planning permission for any development beyond the existing use except in the same two cases; that is to say, where development charge had been paid in respect of the development, or where, by reason of Part VIII of the Act, none was payable at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There again, if development charge has actually been paid the value attributable to the permission to develop is included in the existing use value compensation, and the result is that, in effect, the man has already had compensation in the shape of repayment of development charge, or the equivalent. Therefore it is obviously right for that reason that the previous owner should not be entitled to claim under the Bill on the ground that he has paid development charge, because he has also had back the equivalent of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time it is right that he should still be paid for the development value of the land, and that he will obtain under Clause 6, which we shall be shortly discussing. Under that Clause he will get the claim holding value or so much of it as attached to the land
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1239</span>
bought. The hon. Member rightly says, "Yes, that is all very well, but why should the Central Land Board have the power to do what it thinks fit?" The reason is that in some cases planning permission may not have been revoked; it may be that it has been modified. In that case there must obviously be some sort of proportion sum or apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other cases it may be only part of the land which is affected; only part of the land on which charge was paid may have been bought and, therefore, in that case the owner can be said to have been compensated for only part of the relevant charge payment, and someone has to make an adjustment. That has been dealt with by providing that the Central Land Board shall have the discretion to do what is right. We entirely agree that it should not be left in that way, and that there should be an appeal to the Lands Tribunal, which will have the right to put right anything which has gone wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained the matter. I think one can summarise it by saying that it is helpful, in considering this Clause, to remember that this is a sort of clearing-up process, as it were, because if the matter is taken on too broad lines we shall find that people will be getting too much. In some cases in this Bill provision is made in respect of people who may be getting too little, but this is a matter to deal with those who may be getting too much. The language is rather tightly compressed, but I hope I have managed to explain that this is a case where, if subsection (5) were not in the Bill, payment would be made by virtue of the Clause; that is to say that the main part of Clause 4 would result in too much being paid. Therefore these complicated provisions are inserted in order to cover those cases where a man has already, in effect, been compensated in respect of his outlay on development charge or its equivalent, or part of it, and provision is made that he is not to receive payment in respect of it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be better if I left the matter in that way, but if there are further details which I can provide, I shall be glad to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I shall have to ask my right hon. and learned Friend to speak again. I understand that we are discussing two Amendments together, and as he did not give
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
me an opportunity to explain why I put down my Amendment, I shall have to argue quite a different point from that with which he has dealt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend. I thought that it would be more convenient if I replied first to the hon. Member for Brierley Hill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not complaining at all. The point I wish to make is somewhat distinct and that is why my Amendment refers to paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). The explanation of paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is com plete; it is to prevent double payment under Clause 22 of the principal Act, which no one would claim that those concerned were entitled to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) raise a somewhat different point and I wish to put it to the Committee because this is the first ripple revealing the rock on which this whole settlement of the Minister will founder in a few years if we are not careful. It is an illustration of the unfairness which will arise increasingly between the case of a man who keeps his land and that of a man who is C.P.O.'d. While in certain of these cases it leads to local authorities getting the land cheaper, that is unwise, in the long run, even from their point of view, because they have to operate with the good will of their neighbourhood; and where unfairness arises and becomes obvious, it is not to a local authority's advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless I have misunderstood their purpose, paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) are not on all fours with paragraph (	<i>a</i>) and do not merely prevent a double payment. Consider, first, the position of the man who at all material times has kept his land. In effect, the Bill wipes out the 1947 Act altogether. The man had an existing use value and a claim; he has paid development charge, and he will get it back. If, therefore, at the outset he had land worth £1,000 and as a result of working on it had increased its value by £500 and had paid development charge of £500, he is left at the end of the proceedings with land, as a result of his work, now worth £1,500, because ho has got his development charge back. That is as it should be, and that is the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But consider what happens to the man who is in every other respect in the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
position, and who had land exactly as valuable but has had the compulsory purchase order procedure applied to him. He starts with land with the same existing use value; he does the same work on it, and it is true that after the compulsory order procedure he gets more than he would get if he had not done any work on it. But when he comes to draw his claim, that amount will be reduced from his claim under paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He will, therefore, not be left with land worth £1,500, for it has been taken away from him. He will not be given £1,500, because he will get only the original existing use value, the increase on it due to his development, and a claim which has that same increase deducted from it under the provisions of paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). Therefore, this man has his land taken away from him although he has done exactly the same as the man who kept it; but instead of having £1,500 or land worth £1,500, he will have only £1,000. That, I understand, is the effect of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that that is exactly what is intended to happen generally in the future; that is quite logical. But it is precisely that which many of us look upon as the most dangerous feature in this settlement. Within a few years public opinion will say that it is intolerable that while in one set of circumstances a man should have £1,500, another man should have only £1,000 for a precisely similar thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless I have misunderstood the operation of the Clause, that is what will happen. I hope that my right hon. Friend feels that it may be possible to reconsider the subsection, which admittedly deals with past proceedings, and, therefore, the matter is all tied up and by itself cannot do any further damage. The unfairness, if it is unfairness, rests where it is. Unless I entirely misunderstand the way that this provision will work, the Clause has the effect that the man who has never parted with his land compulsorily has the provisions of the 1947 Act completely wiped out, whereas the man whose land has been the subject of a compulsory purchase order, and who has had to part with it against his will, does not get back the increase in the value for which he obtained planning permission because it will be deducted from the claim when
	<span class='label label-info column'>1242</span>
eventually he receives it. I hope that my right hon. Friend will look into this point and, unless my interpretation is wrong, see whether it might be possible to reduce this unfair discrimination against a man whose land has been the subject of a compulsory purchase order as compared with the man who has been lucky enough to keep his land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a change, we are getting away from the legalistic side of the Bill to its practical applications, and I am happy to join in the discussion. I hope it will not embarrass the Minister if I support him in resisting the taking out of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). Let us consider first what happens in the normal free market of land, even assuming there is no 1947 Act and, therefore, no Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of a compulsory purchase order is to give a local authority power to acquire for public purposes the land of an unwilling seller. Since, to protect the public, the district valuer was associated with the compulsory purchase order, a person who had his land compulsorily purchased always got a lower price than the person who sold in a free market. Therefore, even under a completely free market, as envisaged by the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin), the person subjected to a compulsory purchase order was always at a disadvantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The district valuer's job was to find the fair market price, and very often it was perfectly amicably arranged. I have known of thousands of cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was amicably arranged because the owner knew that the local authority had the compulsory purchase power and was prepared to use it. A local authority would not have used the compulsory purchase order procedure if there could have been a free sale and the price agreed with the district valuer behind the scenes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Clause, where a person has been paid and there is then a compulsory purchase order, the public is protected against a double payment. If, under a free sale, a person keeps his land and sells on a free market, if he manages to get away with it in later years it is a matter entirely for those concerned; but to try to draw a distinction under the Clause is entirely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1243</span>
We are departing from the 1947 Act, the great virtue of which was that there was a once-for-all nationalisation of the development values of land. Whether development was allowed or disallowed did not make a great deal of difference to the individual landowner at a particular time. When we are taking away those development rights from the nation and are giving them back to private hands, while still retaining the right either to allow or to disallow development within an area, there is always likely to be the trouble to which the hon. Member for Oldham, East referred, about one person not getting as much as he originally expected. In those circumstances the provisions, as outlined by the Attorney-General, are fair and reasonable in intention and purpose from the general point of view of a local authority in carrying out public work on behalf of the public as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin) will expect me to enter into a discussion on the question of principle. He will probably approve if I confine myself to trying to make clear that the provisions of paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) simply apply the general principle of the Bill in circumstances that I have already tried to explain. The effect of paragraphs (6) and (c) is to disqualify the vendor from claiming under Clause 4, but also to do something else which I am sure my hon. Friend had in mind but did not mention: that is, to substitute instead a claim under Clause 6. Obviously, one cannot have both claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a case which is covered by this provision the effect, therefore, is that the vendor will get three things. He will get the value of the land for present use, and he will get something on account of the fact that development charge has been paid, plus, thirdly, the claim holding. There are various ways in which that might be done, but this has been thought to be the simplest way of doing it. If the vendor were entitled to claim under Clause 4—that is, supposing paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) were omitted-he would be paid twice on account of the payment of the development charge. There would then need to be a provision in Clause 6 cutting him out of entitlement under that,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1244</span>
or at any rate cutting him out to that extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the compensation or sale price is based on the strict provisions of the 1947 Act the vendor would, under Clause 6, receive the whole value of the claim holding, or, at any rate, such part of it as was relevant to the land which was sold. That is because—I apologise for anticipating, but it is necessary to mention Clause 6—the payment in Clause 6 is based on the value of the claim holding reduced by any amount by which the compensation or sale price may have exceeded the existing use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand my hon. Friend wishing to ventilate a general point of view on principle, but once one accepts the principle paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) are necessary unless we are to reorganise the whole of Clauses 4 and 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Lynn Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are obliged for that explanation. It is casting no reflection on the Attorney-General if I say that the explanation that we have had this morning has been much more satisfactory than the explanations on previous occasions. The right hon. and learned Gentleman—we are grateful to him for it—has given, quite fairly and fully, the kind of explanation which we are seeking the whole way through the Bill. We should be grateful if he would continue in that way to give us the kind of full explanation which he has given so adequately this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot refrain from making an observation on drafting. In Bills of this complication it would help very much if they were not dealt with purely as Chinese puzzles, fitting in one piece of legislation with another and leaving it to a collection of experts to work it out—if they can do so. If we had what is found to be convenient in drafting Chancery documents, with which solicitors are extremely familiar, not the introductory words of a recital but with the effect of a recital, showing the purpose of the enactment, which could easily have been adapted from the Attorney-General's words at the beginning of his speech, it would make the approach to the Bill very much easier, and would make it easier to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate at once the Parliamentary draftsman's technical objection to that course. He would immediately say,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
"You are asking for trouble because the introductory words will be in the construction, and might affect the construction. I cannot run that risk" Nevertheless, I believe it is extremely important that the form of these Bills should make it reasonably possible for experts throughout the country to understand what they say—and that is certainly a problem which, we face all the way through this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning next to the discretion of the Central Land Board, we accept that that discretion is inevitable in legislation of this kind. When an effort is being made to undo the 1947 Act and to unscramble what has been scrambled, it is impossible to deal with the matter except by way of giving discretion. But that leads to the observation that when we introduce a discretion of that kind there are bound to be anomalies and there are bound to be heartaches. There can be no entirely satisfactory solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a reflection upon the machinery which is to be adopted but is an inevitable consequence of the principle which the Minister has accepted in attempting to unscramble the 1947 Act at all and, particularly, of the way in which he has attempted to do it. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) that paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) fit in with the Minister's general scheme and are an essential part of his two-tier system. If that two-tier system is to prevail, then obviously paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) must be included, and we do not suggest otherwise. It is an essential part of the principle carried on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, however, made perfectly clear our position on the two-tier system as such, and we entirely agree with the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin) that when the Bill is operated it will break on the two-tier system of payment, although the solution which the Conservatives would propose for that problem and the solution which we should propose are very different. We support the inclusion of paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment is not much more than a drafting Amendment, and it is linked with Amendments in Clauses 7, 11 and 12. The hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Simmons) referred to the importance of a system of appeal from the decisions of the Central Land Board to the Lands Tribunal. That is provided, but, as a purely drafting matter, there is a danger that the appeal might not be wholly affective.

There are various references in different parts of the Bill to the Board "satisfying itself" or to "if the Board is satisfied" This is rather like the famous provision in many Bills, "if in the opinion of the Minister" It might be held that these words preclude the operation of the appeal system because it might be argued—I do not say that it would be successfully argued but we fear that it might be argued—that the use of these words, which often in other directions have been held to make a decision final, would make it final in this case. It might be held that one cannot ask what ought to have been the opinion of the Minister or what ought to have satisfied the Board. I move this Amendment to make it quite clear that the appeal system is to be effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the latitude which the Central Land Board must have if the Bill is to be operated, we are in entire agreement with the Minister's general intention. Much of the machinery of the Bill is to deal with exceptional cases, and in this connection discretionary power must be given to the Board. It is true, however, that the fact that there was no appeal in certain circumstances may have been a defect in the 1947 Act. The provision for appeal to the Lands Tribunal is correct, and we accept it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this opportunity of raising a point which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>
perhaps it would have been more convenient to raise on the earlier Amendment. It arose out of the Attorney-General's observations on the position of the owner from whom land had been compulsorily acquired. I am not sure that I completely understood the Attorney-General. I understood him to say that, in the sort of case to which subsection (5, 	<i>b</i> and 	<i>c</i>) refer, where the land had been compulsorily acquired, the owner would be paid a sum made up of the following factors: first, existing use; secondly, something for development charge; and thirdly, the claim holding. Would the total of those three amount to more—as would appear to be the case—than the present use plus the claim holding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the principle of these cases was that payment should be restricted, as the maximum, to the present use plus the claim holding. I think the principle most clearly appears, although it runs through all these cases, in Clause 9 (4), which says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the principal amount of a payment made by virtue of this section"—</p></blockquote>
and that is a different case, but I am relying on the principle which I under stand to apply to all cases—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of a claim holding shall be the value of the holding or the amount of the consideration for the disposition, whichever is the less"</p></blockquote>
If I am wrong in my understanding of this principle, I should like to be corrected and to know on what ground the differentiation in the case of a compulsory purchase or sale under the shadow of compulsory purchase is made by paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where the development charge has been paid, the provision is intentionally inserted that there shall be some recompense. It has, in effect, become associated with the existing use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must probe this matter a little further. I understood that the fundamental principle, emphasised time and again by the Minister on Second Reading and in Committee, is that in relation to a payment in respect of compulsory purchase or in respect of compensation in the future for injurious affection or anything of that kind, the principle shall be the same the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
way through and shall be the 1947 valuation added to the existing use. I still do not see what difference in principle there is between this compulsory purchase with which we are dealing, or purchase under the shadow of compulsory purchase, and the general principle which the Minister has enunciated time and again as being fundamental to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we be given an example, with figures allocated to the present use value, the development charge and the claim holding to see how they dovetail with each other; to see the effect, and how and to what extent they amount to more than the present use plus the claim holding; and to see what is the principle which justifies that which is reconcilable with the principle which the Minister has said time and again is fundamental to the Bill—namely, that the claim holding should be the maximum payment for development value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the point which I tried to make. If what I was trying to do by leaving out paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) is in fact done by the interpretation of this provision—and I was just as interested in the Attorney-General's reply as was the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East (Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas)—then that is precisely the point of the case which I gave. If Clause 6 does simply what I wanted to do under Clause 4—because development charge has been paid and it seemed more appropriate that it should be dealt with under Clause 4—then I am satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all that happens is that paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) take the matter out of Clause 4 into Clause 6, because although development charge has been paid it is a compulsory purchase and, therefore, should come under Clause 6; and if Clause 6 has the effect that a man who has done this development and paid this charge gets his original existing use value plus his original claim plus the development charge which he has paid, then that is what I tried to do by leaving out paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is what is being done, as the Attorney-General seemed to indicate, I am perfectly satisfied, but, with great respect, I very much doubt whether that interpretation, which both the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East and myself seemed to get from the Attorney-General's speech, is what will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1249</span>
happen in fact. That will please the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, North-East and it will not please me, but we had better know what is going to happen That is why I sought to include the provision within Clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the position is that when development charge has been paid the development which it represents is regarded as notionally passing into the existing use value and thereby increasing it, and we propose to pay the claim on the top of that. That may, of course, be more than the existing use and claim, without development charge, but under the 1947 Act that is what happened. Under the 1947 Act, in the compulsory purchase price we had allowance for the development charge and we also had the claim on the £300 million, so that this seems to be the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. and learned Gentleman talks about the 1947 existing use he ought to remember that we are not always limited, as we said the other day, to the 1947 existing use. It may be that when we are able to do so we can take existing use at the date when we are considering the value. When we are dealing with past cases, however, we cannot do so because they were dealt with on the then existing use value. I should have thought that the addition of the development charge element to that was equivalent to the increase one gets when a man is able to claim on the existing use value in 1954 instead of that in 1947. I do not think there is much difference between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I must pursue this matter a little further. First, I should like to ask what subsection in this Bill carries the develop ment charge into existing use value as a subject of computation? Secondly, I make an observation on the general method of dealing with this matter. The development charge, as I have always understood it, is something which counterbalances the claim holding, the claim holding being the counterbalancing factor to the development charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I shall be corrected if I am wrong in my interpretation. There is the claim holding, which represents the old
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
claim on the £300 million fund, and the claim holding goes with the dropping of the development charge. They are counterbalancing items. If that is so, how is it that the development charge is carried into the present use value? It does not seem to be the contra item on the other side of the account. That is what is puzzling me at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then one turns to page 8, line 25—Clause 6 (4). That says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The principal amount of a payment made by virtue of this section in respect of a claim holding—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) in a case falling within paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section, shall be the value of the holding, reduced by any amount by which the compensation or sale price exceeded the existing use value of the interest;"</p></blockquote>
There is a similar provision in Clause 6 (4, 	<i>b</i>). Here again we seem to have the principle that the maximum payment in addition to the existing use value is to be that of the claim holding, yet we are told that that is not so, because something for the development charge—or the development charge itself, I am not quite clear which—is to be imported into the existing use value. It makes the matter extremely difficult and confusing to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, under the 1947 Act one could pay the development charge in two ways. One could either pay in cash or one could pledge the claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only on a single plot holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could set it off. If, under the 1947 Act, the development charge had been paid in cash and a compulsory purchase was then contemplated, that would take place at a value which would then include the old existing use value plus the new value created by the development which took place. But, by that, one did not abandon one's claim on the £300 million. That remained. If it had been paid last summer as it was supposed to be, one would still have had one's proportion of the fund. I think that this is just the same principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise to the Committee? I was most anxious to avoid anticipating. I did go ahead for one moment, but then stopped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
I did not read in Clause 7 (1) the words which show the point as regards this question of existing use. The existing use value of the interest is dealt with in Clause 7 (1, 	<i>b</i>) in such a way as to include in it the additional compensation attributable to the permission in respect of which the development charge was paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One therefore gets the result which I have indicated, because the fact that because one paid a development charge and received, on acquisition, something more than the value of the land on its present use, does not prevent one receiving the whole value of the claim holding, because in Clause 7 (1, 	<i>b</i>) there is a specific provision which defines existing use value to secure this result. That is seen in the last lines of the paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as modified by sections fifty-one to fifty-five of the principal Act"</p></blockquote>
That does give the extended meaning to
	<br><blockquote><p>this expression</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the existing use value of an interest…."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it then mean that in the case of Clause 7 (1, 	<i>b</i>) the payment for existing use value includes a payment for potential development value? If that is so, then, as I understand it, it is by reference to the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In past cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in past cases. If that is so why, on top of that—when they are having that payment for potential development value—are they to have this extra payment? That is what puzzles me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I am the cause of the trouble. I had not observed the significance of this point with regard to Clause 7, but, as I understand it, it is quite clear now. One has, in effect, the new existing use and one is getting back an existing use which is partly what is on the ground and partly a right for which one has paid. In addition to that one has a claim—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly the same as the existing law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the object before was to get rid of the 1947 Act. We can hardly be blamed for not observing that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
the object of paragraph (a) of Clause 4 (5) was to get rid of the existing law whereas the object of paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) was merely to preserve it. But I am quite satisfied now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin) is satisfied, I am very worried. If he is satisfied then I am certain there is now a double payment to landlords. I was looking at certain subsections of this Clause from the point of view, very largely, of abortive expenditure, that is, where there had been permission to develop, and certain works and proposals had been undertaken. As I understand it now, we are considering a case where the owner put in certain proposals for the development of a parcel of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those proposals were agreed. The owner paid the development charge but undertook no work whatever, although in fact there had been a planning permission and payment of development charge in anticipation of works to be carried out. On compulsory purchase that person gets, not the existing use value and his claim, which would have been fair, but the existing use value of the land plus the additional value of the development which he intended to, but did not, carry out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He paid for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He paid for it but, after all, he was to get his payment in addition to a claim on the £300 million, which had a relationship to the development charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An individual example would make this point very much easier for the lay man to understand. Suppose we had a piece of land valued at £100 an acre. The development charge for placing a house on that land was to be £300 an acre—as land developed for building purposes. That makes £400 an acre for the parcel of land. Because the owner's proposal to build had been agreed he had paid £300 development charge and still had a claim on the £300 million. If the local authority now comes along and wants to acquire that land the owner is to get the existing use value plus the development charge which he has paid—that is £100 plus £300—plus a claim on the £300 million. That brings it to £700.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the hon. Member for Oldham, East, being quite satisfied,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
but surely that result is totally wrong. If the person building the house had got the footings in and had carried out certain works, and then a laggardly local authority had said, "Now we are going to purchase compulsorily," I think that the owner would be entitled to compensation for abortive expenditure. I should never oppose that. But if no expenditure has been incurred surely his only entitlement ought to be the existing use value plus the claim under the £300 million—and even under that he is getting the full claim, whereas it is likely that many owners thought that they would not get it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member realises that the owner would have been entitled to the original existing use and his claim, if he had not paid a penny to anyone, so surely, in addition to that, he is entitled to the amount of money he paid over to the authority. If, having paid nothing, he should get the original use value it must surely be fair for an owner to get back in addition the money he paid over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I put this in a simple way I hope that the Clause may receive the assent of the Committee. If this is a criticism at all, it is a criticism of the 1947 Act, because it is simply what would have happened. It is purely a mathematical calculation. If the owner has paid the £300 that is really part of the existing use value. Therefore, if he did not get it back and did not have his claim we should be acting unfairly but, because we thought that what was done in the 1947 Act was righ—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —we have tried to follow it. That is all that it amounts to. I am only a layman, but it seems to me to be a purely mathematical calculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are very much obliged to the layman for his intervention. I think that I understand it and am now seized of the point. It really is a most astonishing reflection upon this Bill when we have the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin)—to whom the Minister has referred, quite rightly as an expert—quite solemnly seeking to omit paragraphs with a view to achieving the result which is achieved by the inclusion of the very paragraphs which he seeks to eliminate. It is a fantastic
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
position. It shows how extremely difficult this Bill is to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I can say almost without contradiction that the 1947 Act—which I have been re-reading in relation to this Bill—is child's play compared with this Bill. The hon. Member for Oldham, East, nods his head in agreement with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two meanings of the words "child's play."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it would be a very precocious child, but all these terms are comparative, and, compared with this Bill, the 1947 Act is child's play.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I first, at some risk, suggest to the Committee what I think Clause 5 means? I may be under a delusion, but it seems to be a rather simple Clause—a machinery Clause. Where a development charge has been considered to have been incurred, the Clause merely determines the person by whom it was incurred, and the amount of the charge. Subsection (2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Part of this Act the person by whom a development charge was incurred shall toe taken to to the person by whom or on whose behalf the charge was paid or, if the charge was not paid in full in the first instance, the person who undertook to pay the charge or the unpaid balance thereof"</p></blockquote>
The question that arises is to whom did the person undertake to pay? I should have thought that in this case it must have been the Central Land Board, and I should have thought it would have been much clearer if we had said so. If we do not, there may be all sorts of interesting speculations about what this provision means, and I am sure none of us wants any more mysteries in this Bill, which is already so full of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that from the construction of the Clause as it is that intention would have been read into it, but I think it would be just as well to make it as clear as possible and, therefore, I would advise the Committee to accept the advice given us by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington), and to insert these words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment agreed to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeffington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question to put arising out of subsection (3, 	<i>b</i>). I wonder whether there is anywhere in the Bill a provision specifically requiring the Central Land Board to determine what would have been the single capital payment. Another question is whether there is, when that amount has been fixed, any appeal, should there be any dispute about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is any provision anywhere else in the Bill that requires determination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would not be an appeal in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. A. Sparks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Clause is concerned with the proposal for a development, upon which the Central Land Board has assessed development charge. It frequently happens that persons apply to the local planning authority for permission to carry out certain developments, and in cases such as that the Central Land Board would have to assess the development charge thereafter. It often happens, however, that the development is not carried out at all. It may be, and, indeed, I think it will be found, that the Board will have to assess development charge on development that has not taken place and may never take place; or there may be an unknown period of time extending over a number of years before the development takes place. Suppose the development takes place in 10 or 15 years' time. Is the developer liable to pay the development charge already assessed by the Board? That point requires clearing up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can answer the two points that have been put. This Clause defines the circumstances in which the development charge is deemed to have been incurred. It must be assessed as a capital sum because that is the only way in which we can assess it. For the convenience of the individual it has been arranged that he can pay the determined sum as a series of instalments, but it can be assessed only as a capital sum. Although it may be paid in a different way, it is assessed in that form. That is the answer, I think, to the first question. The fact that, for convenience, it is paid in instalments does not detract from the fact that it is assessed as a capital sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the second point, it was not desired to have appeals to the Lands Tribunal in these rather complicated unscrambling arrangements. There never has been an appeal from the Central Land Board to the Lands Tribunal on development charge. I do not think we should wish to open up that possibility because it would lead to long, complicated and troublesome procedures. Nor is it really necessary. We have the appeal that hon. Members thought was right in these rather complicated assess ments where the Central Land Board has to make an act of judgment on the problem dealt with in this Part of the Bill, but I do not think it right to go against what has always been the principle, that there is no appeal against an assessment of the charge by the Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeffington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and I would point out that I was not advocating that there should be an appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite understand. I think that is the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause is simply for the purpose of arriving at a conclusion for the purposes of the application of these unscrambling provisions. I understand the position to be that no further provisions are required for any tidying-up in the direction which the hon. Gentleman mentioned because the 1953 Act deals with the termination of development charge, and provision is made for no development charge to be payable on development started after 18th November, 1952, and if money was paid over

The Amendment is intended to deal with such cases as partitions, dissolutions of partnerships, and exchanges, and transactions of that nature, which are not covered by the Clause. Case B is the case of the owner who sells his land and retains the claim. Case C, in Clause 8, is the case of the landowner who gives away land and retains his claim. Between those two types of transactions, the sale and gift, there are certain intervening classes that, I think, can best be explained by an example. The example is taken from a case involving a £20,000 development claim. So it is of considerable importance.

We establish our Part I claim under the 1947 Act, and we then proceed, in 1949, to sell half of Black Acre. In that respect we undoubtedly come within this Clause. There is a sale, and if we have retained the claim and sold the land, then there is a right to come within Case B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are left, say, with the established claim over the whole of Black Acre but only half of the land. Then, in 1950, we decide to split up this estate between
	<span class='label label-info column'>1258</span>
us and enter into a deed of partition whereby, let us say, the Minister takes the half of Black Acre, but we do not split up the established claim because we are doubtful of the value of it at that time. So that is retained in the hands of the joint owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, let us assume, the Minister sells the half of Black Acre which he acquired under this deed of partition which we have entered into. At that time he is not the holder of the claim. The claim is still vested in the joint ownership, and unless at the time of sale he is the holder of the claim he does not come within the terms of Case B. Clause 12 deals with the residual claims, and one turns to it in the hope that he may come under the provisions of that Clause, but under Clause 12 he would be excluded by the latter part of subsection (2) of that Clause because the sale wholly excluded the development value. So we are in the position of two joint owners holding an established claim not qualifying under either Clause 6 or Clause 12 for any payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, I think, must have happened in many cases of deeds in family arrangements. It will certainly happen in the case of exchanges of land. I take again the example of the Minister and myself. Suppose the Minister owns Black Acre plus an established claim, and I own White Acre without any established claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a point which was raised earlier in the proceedings of this Committee by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), when he mentioned the position of dissolutions of partnerships. If there were a partnership comprising land with an established claim and one partner retired, leaving, for some consideration, the land in the partnership there would have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1259</span>
no division of the established claim because at the time the value of the established claim was doubtful. As the Bill stands neither the continuing partner nor the retiring partner would come within any of the Cases A, B, C, D, or the residual cases under Clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to meet those cases that I move the Amendment. Although the wording of the Amendment may be rather too wide, I would ask my right hon. Friend to consider its substance, because the wording of the Clause, where it deals with the sale and the price, seems far too narrow, and may cause considerable hardship in the kind of cases I have tried to illustrate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment points to a difficulty which I admit on consideration may be found to exist in a very small number of cases. We have to remember that in this Part of the Bill, which is the unscrambling part, we are dealing with a number of cases which have happened. Therefore, all this does not apply to the future, but to the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the purpose of his Amendment is to try to bring within the scope of Part I of the Bill those cases in which there has been a disposition of land which is not strictly a sale and not strictly a gift, but some kind of intermediate transaction. One example he gave was where there had been an exchange which could not be said either to be a gift or a sale, and another was a disposition of an interest, previously owned by a partnership, to one of the partners. He was good enough to include me as one of the partners in this hypothetical operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that there are possibly cases of that kind which are not included in the definition, because they can hardly be described either as dispositions by sale or by gift. It is difficult to find precise words to cover such cases, which I imagine are very special, but we will certainly try to find suitable words to cover them, as well as all the other kinds of transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood my hon. Friend to indicate that he thought the words of his Amendment—which he put down to call attention to the problem—would not be suitable, because they were too wide. I would ask him, therefore, to allow us to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
see if we can produce a more definite provision to cover these rather special cases. I imagine they are few in number, but it is important that we should cover them if that be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind my hon. Friend that the Clause cannot function unless it be possible to assess the value of the consideration and, therefore, however much we desire to cover such cases, there must be some method of assessing the consideration. That having been said, perhaps my hon. Friend will allow us to leave the matter for the time being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot refrain from making the obvious observation, that this is another instance of the many difficult cases which are bound to arise in the administration of this Measure, in which one is trying to unscramble something which has been scrambled. I am sure that as we proceed to discuss this Bill, hon. Members will reach the conclusion that it becomes more desirable to have a clean-cut solution and to come down firmly on principle on one side or the other, rather than to have what this Bill is—a compromise upon a compromise which no one can understand; and which, when it comes to be worked, will create an enormous number of anomalies and consequent heartburnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the Minister about the difficulty of finding, and the need for having, a valuation where a price has not already been decided. That means more machinery for deciding how to assess the value, notwithstanding that there will be obvious delay in the matter. It is another instance of the kind of difficulties which inevitably arise from the operation upon which the Minister has embarked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my right hon. Friend for his assurance. I do not think there need be any great difficulty about assessment, because in all these transactions there will have been assessment for the purpose of Stamp Duty. The matter will have gone before the district valuer for that purpose, which may provide a means of ascertaining the value in an easy way. In view of the assurance of the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand, Mr. Thomas, why you miscalled an Amendment a few minutes ago because I find great difficulty in sorting out the "pages" of the Bill from the "panel" of the Committee. Even that pun is excusable on such occasions as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were discussing compulsory purchase orders earlier I wondered whether that discussion in part covered what I am endeavouring to deal with now. Subsection (2) reads as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No payment shall be made by virtue of this section by reason that an interest in land was compulsorily acquired or sold as mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of the preceding subsection if the compensation payable in respect of the acquisition thereof, or the price at which the interest was sold."</p></blockquote>
Does this mean that if land has been acquired by agreement in the open market by an authority having compulsory powers the previous owner will receive no compensation for the difference between the price paid and the existing price value, plus the admitted claim?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have carefully read what the Minister said during the Second Reading debate, and that does not help us very much. I must apologise if I appear to understand more and more about less and less, or less and less about more and more, but this Bill is an extraordinary Measure. It reminds me of what Wilde said about foxhunting—that it was the pursuit by the unspeakable of the uneatable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with some compulsory orders by local authorities, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) that it is the purpose of such orders to bring under public ownership land from unwilling sellers. But in reading all the cross-sections here it would appear that we shall require to have another lengthy explanation from the Attorney-General about what the Bill does not mean. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will, of course, be corrected later by the Minister, who will tell us what the Bill does mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
If anything I have said prompts an hon. Member opposite to say that the point has been dealt with earlier, and that I should have understood it, I can only quote the words of the hymn
	<br><blockquote><p>"Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see The distant scene; one step enough for me"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the point I wish to make is so short it will save time if I put it now. It is not a point of substance but, for once in a way, of explanation. If the Committee will turn to page 8 of the Bill and look at subsection (3, 	<i>a</i>) they will find that no payment shall be made by virtue of this section at all,
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) if it was a compulsory acquisition, or a sale to a public authority possessing compulsory purchase powers, was effected in pursuance of a notice to treat served, or a contract made, on or after the sixth day of August …"</p></blockquote>
Unless that be so, no payment shall be made. But if that is so, under the provisions of the 1947 Act I do not see how a case under subsection (2, 	<i>a</i>) can arise at all, because compensation under the provisions of Part II of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1944, was abolished by the 1947 Act. Therefore it seems to me that if one cannot get any payment unless it was a transaction of the kind mentioned in subsection (3, 	<i>a</i>) it is impossible that there can ever be cases in which compensation would arise under subsection (2, 	<i>a</i>)..
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanation may be that there were some transactions in process where, under some provision, the Minister allowed compensation to go on being assessed under the 1944 Act, although in fact under the 1947 Act they would have been ruled out. Unless that is the case I do not see how it can be possible, under a provision which was wiped out, that subsection (3, 	<i>a</i>) should attract compensation under the provisions of Part II of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1944.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must express my gratitude to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Pannell) for his invariable courtesy in these matters. I assume that he was referring to me as being "unspeakable" and to himself as being "uneatable"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member is perfectly right in saying that this point has not been dealt with before. The subsection which he proposes to leave out refers to special cases, and I think I should best explain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
it if I put the matter in a simple way. The main purpose of the Clause is to provide payments, and there are some cases in which payments ought not to be made, so that an exception must be included in the Clause. The exception is that no payment is to be made in consequence of the sale of land to a public authority with compulsory purchase powers in two special types of case. I am told that there are few cases under each of the two headings, and that the disqualification which we wish to apply is equally applicable whether the land is acquired by compulsory purchase or by agreement in the shadow of compulsory purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may take the second case first, it states that no payment must be made if—and then comes paragraph (	<i>b</i>)—it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"compensation calculated on the basis of equivalent reinsatement, or a price agreed by reference to compensation so calculated"</p></blockquote>
Rule (5) of the 1919 Act rules provides that in certain circumstances compensation may be paid on the basis of equivalent reinstatement. The actual language is if the land,
	<br><blockquote><p>"is devoted to a purpose of such a nature that there is no general demand or market for land "for that purpose…"</p></blockquote>
and reinstatement on some other site is intended. In those circumstances one is entitled to have the whole cost of reinstatement. It seems clear that, having had that, one ought not to be entitled to anything more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is more complicated because it deals with transitional cases. The particular transitional case in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is where the compensation was assessed on the basis of the 1944 Act, but where the purchase was not completed until after the 1947 Act was in force. Wher that applies it will be found that compensation under the 1944 Act includes the compensation for development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention under the 1947 Act was that people who received compensation under the 1944 Act should not have any claim on the £300 million. Unfortunately, this was one of those cases in which there was a miscarriage of the provisions of the "perfect Act" of 1947, of which the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) is so proud. As a result, a number of people were left with the right
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
to make the kind of claim which I have just mentioned but which they ought not to have been allowed to make. Some people did not try to profit by the anomaly but others did, and there are a few cases outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee would agree that we must make provision for that sort of case. It is a matter which would have been dealt with in the Treasury scheme. The provision in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is limited simply to rectification of those cases. There are, therefore, two quite limited classes of case where provision must be made to prevent people from getting money to which they are not entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's explanation, I propose to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is usually so correct about these things that I am a little hesitant in replying to him. He may not, perhaps, have appreciated that this is one of those cases in which rather unusual events may have occurred. It is true that in the great majority of cases the compensation or the sale price would represent nothing more than the existing use value, but in a number of cases that was not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there were cases where certain provisions—Section 55 of the 1947 Act, for example—produced an unfairly low figure and acquiring authorities were allowed and encouraged to pay more than the existing use value. In another case, where there was no question of any technical anomaly, the acquiring authorities, either because there was urgent need or for some other reason, paid more than the existing use value rather than invoke their compulsory powers. Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) ensures that there is no double payment in those cases. I am told that very few cases are involved, but they must be taken care of

<br><br><!-- lb -->
An odd position seems to have arisen. As the Bill is drafted, a man who has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1265</span>
already sold an option and has, therefore, completely lost control of his land if it is taken up after the operation of the Bill, will suffer; and has no means of doing anything about it. If the option was already granted, there can be no question of trying to take any advantage of the Bill; the thing has already been done. It is not clear why it should not be possible to get compensation under the Clause unless the man to whom the option has been sold exercises it before the coming into operation of the Bill. The position may be dealt with by a later provision, but the operative point, I should have thought, was when the option was granted. If it has been granted between the qualifying dates, I do not see why compensation should be paid only if the man exercises the option before the Act comes into force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Horobin) is perfectly correct. As the Bill is drafted, payments under the Clause in respect of sales pursuant to an option have to satisfy three tests; three hurdles, as it were, have to be jumped. First, the option must have been granted between 1st July, 1948, and 18th November, 1952, when the White Paper was published. The second condition, which my hon. Friend proposes to delete, is that the option must have been exercised before the Bill comes into operation. Thirdly, the sale must have been completed at the time when the application is made to the Central Land Board for payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On consideration I think that my hon. Friend is quite right, and that there is no need for the second hurdle. The first and third conditions, taken together, are quite satisfactory. It would be a difficult situation, of course, if in 10 or 20 years' time a claim could be put in under Part I, after the whole established claim had been paid under Part V or Part II. But, of course, the Central Land Board have discretionary powers in dealing with applications for payment. Therefore, I venture to advise the Commitee to take out the second of the three conditions, because it is not necessary, and the position is properly covered by the first and the third conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sparks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise a question on subsection (4, 	<i>b</i>) There are many cases in which land has been sold at a price above the existing use value, and in which the person who sold the land will already have been in possession of an established claim from the compensation fund. His claim would be the difference between the existing use value and the development value of the site. If, in the meantime, however, he sold the land for a figure above the existing use value, he is not entitled to full payment of his claim because he did not observe the rules which the 1947 Act established: namely, that the land should have been sold at its existing use value. His claim would have made up the difference to him between that amount and the full development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be completely wrong, but I should like the Minister to say whether cases of this kind are covered by subsection (4, 	<i>b</i>) Does it mean in effect that there will be deducted from the total of the established claim the amount by which the land was sold above the existing use value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member. He has, in effect, described the purpose of the Clause. We are coming presently to Clause 7 and to all the interpretive machinery for carrying it out, but broadly speaking the purpose of the Clause is twofold. First, it deals with the compulsory acquisition case, which the hon. Member has not raised but which was discussed on some of the Amendments. The second purpose, apart from compulsory acquisition, is, in general terms, to compensate persons, who hold claims in respect of land which they sold between the qualifying dates, for the development value represented by those claims in so far as that value has not already been recouped by the sale. In other words, the answer to the hon. Member's question is, "Yes"

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeffington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to emphasise that as I understand the purpose of paragraph (	<i>a</i>), which is part of the machinery for carrying out the principles enshrined in Clause 6, I am very much in favour of it. The Amendment is intended to elicit information as to how the machinery will work in the case in which, under a claim, the amount of compensation already paid or the price attributable to disturbance or severance should be excluded from the amount which the local authority in turn has to pay. This is a question which has aroused a good deal of interest in local authority circles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Horobin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it your intention, Mr. Thomas, to select the Amendment in my name, in page 10, line 21?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may fall on the Minister's earlier Amendment. The hon. Member, therefore, will have his opportunity to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of Clause 6 is to compensate people, who hold claims in respect of land that they sold between certain qualifying dates, for the development value which is represented by their claims, so far as it was not recouped in the sale. Here we are dealing with the special cases of compulsory acquisitions, in which compensation was assessed under certain different heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there was compensation for the land which was taken. In addition, there was compensation for other things, including what is known as severance. For example, if the man holds other land and the taking away of the portion acquired reduces the value of the remainder, he is entitled to compensation for severance; or it may be that the land is made less useful for its purpose or more difficult to work, as often happens in agriculture. Then there is a third class of compensation for disturbance, which is purely persona] and attaches to the man con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1268</span>
cerned. The simplest case is that of compensation for the man who is involved in removing somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is to deal with a case of that kind, those elements must be stripped from the claim. Let me take the simple example of a market gardener, half of whose property, as so often happens, is purchased for housing. He would receive from the local authority the value of the half that is purchased. That would be assessed on the value of existing use, and is the compensation for the land that is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, he would say, "That is all very well, but as a result of the land being taken from me the half of the holding which has been left to me is less economical and more expensive to work, and, therefore, is worth less than it was as part of the entire holding" Compensation is payable in respect of that damage to the land which has not been bought. That is called compensation for severance, or injurious affection. In addition, there may be a claim in respect of the growing crops which have been disturbed or in respect of loss of profits in respect of the business as a result of its interruption through the acquisition of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There we have two elements of compensation which are not related to the value of the land bought. Of course, compensation for disturbance is not related to the value of the land at all in this respect. As, under Clause 6, we are to compare what was paid for the land which was taken with the existing use value of that land plus the value of the claim holding which relates to that land, we must keep these extraneous items out of the comparison; and that is achieved by the definitions in subsection (1) of the Clause, which fixes the meaning of the terms which have been employed in Clause 6; and, particularly, in the provisions of Clause 6 (4, 	<i>a</i>) which says what is to be payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That applies only to purchase under compulsory purchase or in the shadow of compulsory purchase. If we are dealing with a private sale, a figure is settled which has to compensate the vendor for all his losses, into whichever department they fall. If we adopted the same approach, it would be necessary to break down the price paid in each case under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1269</span>
the headings which have been described, and there are obvious difficulties in doing that. There are cases in which the amount paid for severance or injurious affection was too small because of the provisions of the 1947 Act. These come later, in Clause 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir L. Ungoed-Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that these provisions do not bring in and make assessable for compensation any element which was not already the subject of compensation under the 1947 Act. Secondly, in the case of future operations, I should like to know whether these extraneous elements—for example, severance—will be compensated for on the same basis in the future or whether they will be limited within the ambit of the claim holding which will exist by reference to 1947. I gather that these extraneous elements are outside and always have been outside this calculation, that they were outside it under the 1947 Act and will be outside it in future. I should like confirmation of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macmillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first question is, "Yes" The answer to the second question is that we come to the future in Part III. Here we are dealing only with the past.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 9, line 43, to leave out paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer, first, to Clause 6 (4), in which the principal amount of a payment made to a Case B owner is set out? Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) states that the payment is to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"the value of the holding, reduced by any amount by which the sale price exceeded the restricted value of the interest"</p></blockquote>
What is meant by the "the restricted value of the interest" is set out in Clause 7 (2), which states that the restricted value is to be that value at the time of the sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand the principles of the 1947 Act correctly, at that time there were declared to be two elements in the value of land—first, the existing use or restricted value which remained in the landowner, and, secondly, the development value which was transferred to the State, leaving the owner with what is now
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
called an established claim, that is, a promise to pay under certain conditions.

Between 1948 and 1951 that existing use value could have increased by only one of two causes—either the landowner developed the land and increased its value in that way, in which circumstances he will be paid the development charge and come under Case A, or the existing use value of the land was increased by the development of neighbouring property. The question posed here is this: is the owner entitled to the increase in value in the second case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 6 and 7 certainly assert that he is, and it may be that they are right, but I wanted to call attention to the effect of that on a purchaser, who is perhaps the present holder. Perhaps I can do so by giving an example. Let us suppose that there was a landowner in 1948 who established his 1947 Act Part VI claim at £500 on figures of £550 unrestricted value and £50 restricted value. He later sells the plot for £150 instead of his restricted 1947 value of £50. If the existing use value was the same when he sold it as when it was fixed in 1948, he will be entitled under the Clause to a payment of the value of the holding—£500—less the amount by which the sale price exceeded the restricted figure. I have given £50 as the restricted value and £150 as the selling price, so that £100 would be deducted from his payment, giving him a payment of £400. The purchaser would have an unexpended balance, for use later in development, of the remaining £100.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a simple case, but as the Bill stands it is possible for the vendor to argue that at the date of the sale the restricted value was £150 and that he was asking for only the proper value at that date—an increased value not because of any development which he had carried out on the land but because of the development of the adjoining land. The vendor is therefore, entitled both to his £150 in selling the plot and to the whole of the £500 established claim. The effect on the purchaser is that he is left with no unexpended balance for use in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle which I suggest will involve a lot of revaluation and the valuation of the property at the date when the sale occurs; and from that point of view it will undoubtedly cause a great deal of administrative work. But why should the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
unfortunate purchaser lose his unexpended balance and the lucky vendor in effect receive payment twice over for an increase in value due not to his own development of the land but to the development of the adjoining land? I have moved the Amendment in order to obtain some explanation of that position for the unfortunate purchaser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I get this point clear? The 1947 Act required that people should sell at the restricted use value.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point. The 1947 Act said, "In future you shall sell at the restricted value as fixed in 1948 or you shall sell at the restricted value at the time of the sale" I think Clause 7 means the second of those propositions, and I am pointing out how unfortunate that is for the purchaser who, therefore, has his unexpended balance reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (Mr. Ernest Marples)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This part of the Clause deals only with private transactions and not with compulsory purchase orders by local authorities. In the case of compulsory purchase orders by local authorities, the payment is, of course, based on the restricted value or existing use value at the time of the sale. We are dealing here with payments made by the Central Land Board to the holders of claim holdings who sold land at prices wholly or partly excluding development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Clause stands, the payment to the holders will be based on restricted value at the time of the sale. There is an abatement which takes place in the amount to be paid, on the lines requested by the hon. Member for Acton (Mr. Sparks). My hon. Friend's Amendment seeks to ensure that payments will be made on the restricted value at January, 1947, which is the relevant date of the 1947 Act. That is the purpose of the Amendment. It is, in fact, contrary to the basic doctrine of the 1947 Act, as the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Lindgren) pointed out. That basic doctrine is that the restricted value remains, for better or worse, with the owner of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
the land. If he sells in 1955, he sells at 1955 prices. If he sells in 1968, he sells at 1968 prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1947, the Government urged people—they did not require them to do so but they urged them to do so—to sell their land at the restricted value or existing use value at the time they sold it, not at the existing value of January, 1947; and some transactions followed on that plea by the Government. This Bill rests on that principle. It maintains the position established by the 1947 Act. It is one of the basic principles of the Bill that we shall take the restricted value or existing use value at the time of the sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I read what the Minister said on compulsory purchase orders during Second Reading?
	<br><blockquote><p>"I now come to Part III, which deals with the compensation to be paid upon compulsory acquisition. It maintains the position established by the 1947 Act. The price of land bought by public authorities will continue to be its value for existing use at the time of purchase… "</p></blockquote>
As reported in the next column of HANSARD, my right hon Friend continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…I want to emphasise that everyone will be paid the full current value for his existing use. I repeat, that means the full current value, whatever it may be, at the time of compulsory acquisition"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th March, 1954; Vol. 525, c. 56-7.]</p></blockquote>
If that is the basic principle of the Bill, it would be unfair if an owner of land which is compulsorily purchased were to get the restricted value at the time of sale, while a private purchaser of the land had applied to him the principle that it was the restricted value as at 7th January, 1947. It would be wholly unfair that, when land is compulsorily acquired, the compensation payable should be based on one type of existing use value but should be based on another type for private purchasers. The Amendment would be a breach of the principle upon which my right hon. Friend has based this Measure, and I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sparks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see the substance of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument. Two wrongs never made a right. I should not have thought it a good principle whereby land was permitted to be acquired under compulsory purchase orders at the current existing use value. Presumably the owner of the land about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1273</span>
to be sold would be in possession of an established claim. He would, therefore, be entitled to his established claim, which is the difference between the existing use value at the date in 1947 and the development value. I do not know why that owner should now be permitted to receive, in addition to the established claim, the difference between the existing use value as at 1947 and as at the time of purchase. There is really no case for that at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may interrupt, the value may, of course, go up or down, and the 1947 value is not necessarily lower than the current value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sparks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With that added complication, I agree. We are, however, really concerned with the proper use of public funds so far as we can control them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent we are again in confusion about this matter. I raised this matter earlier and asked the Attorney-General whether it was, in fact, the case that where in a private transaction the owner had received a sum which was in addition to the existing use value as at 1947 that additional amount would be deducted from the established claim. I understood the Attorney-General to say, in effect, that it would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood that if, for instance, the existing use value of the land in 1947 was £50 and the owner later, or round about that time, sold it to a purchaser for £150, he would be getting £100 more than the existing use value of the land upon which his claim for compensation was determined, and that that £100 would be deducted from his established claim. I now understand that the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is right, that the £100 would not be deducted, and that he would receive his established claim in full, plus the £100 which he had received on selling the land, which was over and above the existing use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here again I do not think that the principle upon which we are working is a good one: we should take 1947 existing use values as the basis throughout. Just because the hon. Gentleman has made a mistake in regard to compulsory purchase orders we should not, therefore, make a second mistake in regard to private sales. I think it most inequitable. If, where a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
claim is established and the amount that the owner is to get is known, the owner then deliberately sells the land at a figure above the existing use value, it means that the purchaser has to pay more than he should be expected to pay. In my opinion, the purchaser in that case ought to be recouped for the amount which has been extorted from him as a result of the sale of the land above the existing use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what the Parliamentary Secretary says now is correct it means that the purchaser of the land is not to be entitled to recoup to himself the excess amount he has had to pay because the owner, having already an established claim, wanted a bit more for himself. I think that it is quite unfair and inequitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Though much of the point of this Amendment has departed, its purpose is very largely to try to find out from the Attorney-General precisely what is the Government's case in this Clause. Paragraph (c) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a case where the interest was sold subject to a mortgage, subsection (3) of section sixty-two of the principal Act (which requires a mortgaged interest to be valued as if the mortgage had (been discharged) did not apply; and"</p></blockquote>
Section 62 (3) of the principal Act is very brief. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The restricted and the unrestricted values of an interest in land which is subject to a mortgage shall be computed as if the mortgage had been discharged"</p></blockquote>
The essential point of Section 62 (3) of the principal Act was incorporated in Part VI of the principal Act. That lays down the basis upon which payment out of the central fund in respect of the depreciation of land values shall be established. In arriving at the amount of the claim it means, in effect, that land which was sold under a mortgage shall be regarded as having the mortgage discharged. As I understand it, therefore, no notice whatever would be taken of the fact that there is a mortgage when the value of the land is computed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1275</span>
I cannot understand what cases there would be outside that category. As far as I can see it would be quite impossible to establish a claim to compensation which did take into consideration its value in so far as a mortgage was concerned. This, I think, is one of the exceptional or anomalous cases which the right hon. Gentleman needs to cover. If, in the light of the provision of the principal Act, he could explain the intention of paragraph (	<i>c</i>), it would be very helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Acton (Mr. Sparks) has so clearly pointed out, one of the assumptions in Part VI of the 1947 Act, when dealing with valuation, was that any mortgage was to be disregarded. That was when we were assessing either the restricted or the unrestricted value. It was, after all, a necessary assumption if we were to arrive at the true measure of the development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the owner of the mortgaged land wants to sell it he can deal with it in several ways. He can pay off the mortgage and sell the land free from it, or he can do what is provided for here—sell it subject to mortgage. If he does that we have to consider what we then have to do. Ought we to take the mortgage into account or not? In that case it is quite obvious that he will have secured a lower price. That obviously should be taken into account, because the amount which he is to be paid is the value of the claim holding reduced by the excess of the sale price over the restricted value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Clause 6 (4, 	<i>b</i>) if the sale price was reduced because of the mortgage, but the restricted value was not reduced, then the vendor would get the amount of the mortgage out of the claim holding, although he had sold subject to it. That is why we have to provide for reduction of restricted value, because here we are performing an operation different from that under the 1947 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>
	<li>in a case where the land was requisitioned land at the date of the sale and, by reason of a payment under the War Damage Act, 1943, the value of the claim holding referred to in subsection (1) of the last preceding section was affected by a re-determination of development value under paragraph 6 of the First Schedule to this Act, the state of the land had been at the date of the sale what it would have been at the beginning of the period of requisition if the war damage had occurred immediately before the beginning of that period; and</li>
	<li>in a case where the value of the claim holding aforesaid was affected by reason of the fact that Rule (3) of the Rules set out in section two of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, was disregarded as mentioned in paragraph 10 of the First Schedule to this Act, the reference in subsection (1) of section sixty-two of the principal Act to the said Rule (3) were omitted.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The Amendment is one of not much more than a drafting character. Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) as at present drawn was intended to secure that, where the modifications in the First Schedule affected the basis on which the restricted value of an interest was assessed for the purposes of Part VI of the 1947 Act, the basis on which the restricted value was assessed for the purposes of Clause 6 should be modified in the same way. That was the purpose of paragraph (	<i>d</i>) but its wording is not altogether effective, because, looking at the Schedule, it is drafted by reference to the determination of development value, and not by reference to the assessment of the restricted and unrestricted values from which the development value is built and by which the calculation is made.

	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that where the Minister issued in respect of that land or any part thereof a certificate under section eighty of the principal Act (which relates to land ripe for development before the first day of July, nineteen hundred and forty-eight), then—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>

	<li>the said references in the last preceding section shall be construed as references to the amount aforesaid increased by 	<i>the</i> amount of any development charge which, in the opinion of the Central Land Board, would have been determined to be payable in respect of the development of that land or that part, being development specified in the certificate, if the certificate had not been issued and the charge had fallen to be determined at the date of the sale.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This Amendment goes rather further than the previous one, but it is for the same purpose, to remedy a defect of the provisions of Clauses 6 and 7 where they apply to cases where dead-ripe land is sold to a private purchaser and the vendor retains the claim on the £300 million fund. Hon. Members will remember that the main effect of a certificate under Section 80 of the 1947 Act was that no development charge was payable in respect of the development specified in the certificate. Consequently no claim could be made on the £300 million fund in respect of the development value attributable to the prospects of that development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases—in nearly every case—no claim could be made on the fund at all because the development specified in the certificate under Section 80 represented the most profitable use of the land. The Bill is not concerned with cases where there is no claim at all. In a number of cases, however, the development specified in the certificate did not exhaust the development value of the land. The certificate, it may be, was in respect of the erection of houses, whereas the land may have had a higher value for the erection of something else—a factory, let us say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a case the owner may have established a claim on the £300 million fund under the 1947 Act for the difference between the housing value and the most profitable possible development of the land. Let us call it for this purpose the "factory value" That is the kind of case with which the Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
is concerned. If the owner has sold the land, retaining his claim on the fund, he will have looked at the sale price to recompense him, not only for the value of the land or its present use, but also for the value attributable to the certificate which was excluded from his claim on the £300 million fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the sale was to a public authority with powers of compulsory purchase then the value attributable to the certificate would have been included in the existing use value, and the formula in the Clause will give the proper result. That is all right where there has been a compulsory purchase, but in the case of a private sale the formula in Clause 6 (4, 	<i>b</i>) would not operate fairly because the restricted value as defined in Clause 7 (2) does not include the value of the certificate. The result would be that the additional amount which the vendor quite properly received in his price on account of the certificate would be deducted from the value of his claim holding in assessing the payment due to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Amendment does is to remedy that by providing that where the land sold was the subject of a dead-ripe certificate the reference to the restricted value in Clause 6 (4) is to be taken as a reference to the restricted value of the land plus the value attributable to the certificate. The value of the certificate is the value of the exemption from development charge which it confers. The simplest way of getting a fair result is by adding to the restricted value the amount of the development charge which would have been assessed, if the certificate had not existed, on the development specified in it. The assessment has to be made as at the time of sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that is the simplest way of dealing with what otherwise would have an unfair result. Perhaps I can best illustrate it by an example. Suppose a piece of land had a restricted value of £100. Its full market value, building houses at 15 to the acre, would be £2,100. Therefore the full development value was was £100 and the full value was £2,100. Therefore, the full development value was £2,000. Suppose the planning permission and the certificate were for development at 12 houses to the acre, and that the corresponding development value would be £1,500. That leaves a gap of £500 between the full development value and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1279</span>
the development value included in the certificate. This difference between £1,600—the restricted value plus the value of the certificate—and the unrestricted value of the £2,100 is the Part VI claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume—and I am not dealing with compulsory purchase, for that is covered already—that the land with the certificate was sold for £1,600. According to the proper principles of the 1947 Act, that is certainly what the vendor ought to have got—£100 for the restricted value and £1,500 for the certificate value, a total of £1,600. As the Bill is drawn, and this is the object of the Amendment, the vendor's payment of the £1,500 which is the excess of the sale price over the restricted value of £100, would be deducted from the £500 claim, and the payment would be nil. Obviously, this £500 is owing to somebody, and this Amendment is simply to see that the payment is not by our formula made nil, but that the £500 goes to the vendor. The Amendment achieves that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindgren</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister for his lengthy and most detailed explanation, but this is one of those cases, in which we need a little more information. The Section 80 cases were excluded from the Act, and they were cases where there were plans for development and in which preparations had been made for development, and in which, but for war circumstances, development would very likely have taken place between 1939 and 1945, certainly between 1945 and 1948, when the Act came into operation. It would have taken place but for the restrictions which were imposed by the war-time Government because of the war, and by the succeeding Government because of the difficulties of the post-war years. These were cases of pieces of land which were ripe for development but were excluded from the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I cannot see is why, if the development was that for which the plans had been made prior to the 1947 Act, there should be any compensation. It is true that in some cases there could have been intensified development or a different type of development, but if the development was of the sort that would in any case have taken place, why should there be this payment of £500?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understand, however, that the Clause deals with the provisions relating to compulsory acquisitions and sales. I have tried to make either head or tail of the

I do not know whether that is clear to anybody else. It certainly is not to me. It looks as though its object is to increase the payment. The words "increase the payment" are in line 22.

The Central Land Board can increase the payment. I am always suspicious when it is proposed that we increase payments to landlords. The Government have done a little in that direction by another Measure, increasing the payments to landlords of houses. This appears to be increasing payments to landlords of land. Usually this means a burden on tenants, the people who inhabit dwellinghouses.
