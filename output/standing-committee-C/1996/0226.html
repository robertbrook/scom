</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is in order for me to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill. I understand that this is your first Standing Committee as Chairman. You shake your head, so clearly it is not your first time as Chairman—perhaps it is your second. However, as will rapidly become clear, this is my first Standing Committee as the promoter of the Bill and I have no doubt that I shall be seeking your indulgence during our proceedings. Exactly what our constituents in Bournemouth will make of the situation, we may find out in a few week's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would replace the word "audit" in the Bill with the word "assessment". All my amendments are drafting amendments to give the Bill greater clarity and they have been tabled in response to widespread consultation that I have undertaken with the Department of Trade and Industry officials, the DTI-led Taskforce 2000 and the top 100 companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Dalyell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify a matter for me? I suspect that all of us have been approached by the Confederation of British Industry, which has expressed how unhappy it is about the situation. Was the consultation process extended to the CBI? If so, what was the response?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking that question, because I spoke to someone from the CBI earlier today. I understand that a reassessment of its original position on the Bill is currently under way. As the CBI becomes more clear about the Bill's merits and uniqueness, I hope that that reassessment will result in a more supporting attitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments have been tabled in response to the widespread consultation process that I conducted. Those that we are now discussing were suggested by the chartered accountants, BKL, 3i plc and Freshfields. The use of the word "audit" has caused some confusion because, first, it is equated more with the audit of financial accounts as opposed to the audit of millennium compliancy of the computer systems of companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the word "audit" could imply that an independent third party would be required to examine the computer systems of companies, which is not necessarily the case. Therefore, the word "assessment" is a more appropriate word to use in the Bill; it is more flexible and it could mean an internal assessment, an external assessment or a detailed or cursory appraisal. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr. Ian Taylor)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill. Before I deal with the amendment, I wish to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) on his initiative in getting the Bill this far and on stirring up such a vital debate. If I catch your eye during the clause stand part debate, I hope to be able to extend my comments in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, the amendments were tabled to avoid there being confusion with the statutory financial audit and the implication that the assessment must be carried out by an external auditor, independent of the company. I accept them in principle, but I believe that it will help the Committee if I express now the Government's position on these and other amendments, and on the Bill itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did not object to the Bill being given a Second Reading without debate because we were keen for the Committee to have the chance to consider the serious problem of the century date change. That decision was more than justified by the publicity surrounding the subject and the Bill—not least in this morning's edition of the 	<i>Financial Times.</i> Nevertheless, we believe that the best way forward is for companies to take voluntary action and, on further reflection, we consider that the Bill would impose an unnecessary burden and cause a wrong shift of focus for what is undoubtedly a severe and serious problem. In that context, the Government do not intend to support the Bill in its—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the phrase "wrong focus". Will he explain why it would be a wrong focus? I think that we are all agreed that it is an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
extremely serious problem but, putting it bluntly, some of us do not know sufficient about it to pass judgement on whether the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East is going about it the right way or not. What exactly is the wrong focus?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my intention to speak at greater length on clause stand part. However, I apologise to the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell); in order to confine my remarks to the amendment, I did not go into detail Suffice it to say that because the Bill will shift our focus to the legal process, with all the necessary to-ing and fro-ing with lawyers, much energy will be focused on not dealing with the problem. The problem is urgent and immediate; it is essential to deal with it if British industry is to survive the problems that will be caused by computers not recognising the "00" at the end of the year 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 17, in page 1, line 12, leave out 'audit' and insert 'assessment'.—[	<i>Mr. David Atkinson.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 1, line 12, leave out '31st December' and insert '1st October'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 6, leave out 'in 1998 or 1999' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'on or after 30th June 1997 and before 1st October 1999'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments were suggested by Ernst and Young and Rolls-Royce during my consultations with the top 100 companies. They rightly pointed out that various firms have different accounting dates and year ends. The amendments allow a realistic maximum of two full financial years prior to the century date change to assess the millennium compliancy of computer systems and to make a report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not in any way doubt the hon. Gentleman's good faith. I am sure that he has engaged in the most detailed consultation. Indeed, everyone should be grateful to him for his initiative in bringing the subject forward. I do not doubt that the hon. Gentleman consulted; I wondered what was the position of the Confederation of British Industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already explained, it is being reassessed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment shows that there are difficulties even in the Bill's phraseology and drafting, regardless of its overall purpose. For example, amendment No. 11 would oblige companies whose financial year ended on 30 June this year to undertake an assessment before that date, which would put an intolerable burden on them.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The Government want to look much more closely at the problems that would emerge if the Bill were enacted. The double digit in the date 2000 presents an obstacle in that it will click in very early in the computer for those companies that have long lead times which go beyond the year 2000, whereas for others, the problem will not arise until that midnight or, for technical reasons, afterwards. There is no doubt that there will be problems, but they will affect companies in different ways, which is why it is difficult to legislate. We are not minded to accept the amendments, especially amendment No. 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the clear advice from my hon. Friend the Minister and his officials, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 13, leave out 'capacity' and insert 'capability'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss amendment No. 2, in title, line 1, leave out 'capacity' and insert 'capability'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is a response to advice that we received from Sir Colin Marshall of British Airways. It would help to avoid a potential confusion over the term "capacity", which, in information technology terms, means a computer's memory capacity, whereas the word "capability" would be more appropriate in the context of the Bill's purpose</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better be careful about Capability Brown and call him Capacity Brown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 1, line 13, leave out 'used' and insert 'operated'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments: </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 8, in page 1, line 13, after 'company', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and essential to the continued trading of the company'.</p></blockquote>
No. 13, in page 2, line 12, leave out 'used' and insert 'operated'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 7 and 13 would replace the word "used" by the word "operated". I hope that the Committee will agree that the word "operated" is more appropriate, as the word "used" could be construed to include the computer systems of third parties, which do not apply under the Bill. Those amendments were proposed by, among others, Denton Hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my ignorance of procedure, I am not sure why amendments Nos. 7 and 13, which are identical, are grouped with amendment No. 8, which would clarify

what computer systems the Bill applies to—namely, those essential to the company's viability or, as the amendment proposes, those
	<br><blockquote><p>"essential to the continued trading of the company".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 8 was recommended by the NatWest Group, the Bank of Scotland and Hutchison Ports. I hope that the amendments as grouped are in order and that they are clear to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too worried about amendments Nos. 7 and 13. Amendment No. 8, however, goes to the heart of the problem. In some ways. I welcome my hon. Friend's change of emphasis as shown by amendment No. 8; I know that that amendment comes from some solid corporate stables. Nevertheless, by changing the scope of the Bill by inserting the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"essential to the continued trading of the company",</p></blockquote>
we raise the problem of defining what is and what is not essential to the trading of a company. It would be for the directors to make that judgement, and it is unclear whether it might be tested in law after a company had failed, or in an action prior to the company's failing.

We face some difficulties. Although we welcome the move away from general requirement on companies to assess even systems that may not be critical, we get into the detail of what are almost value judgments. I understand why the various companies mentioned suggested the amendment because it would reduce the burden on them but in our view it would increase the work of lawyers. Therefore, I am not persuaded that amendment No. 8 would enhance the effect of the Bill as drafted, and am not minded to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to solid corporate stables. I was invited to lunch on Friday by one such solid corporate stable—the hospitable people who run the Standard Life Assurance Co. in Edinburgh. They wanted to talk about the single currency, which I believe we should enter at the first possible opportunity, and devolution, on which I have a history which I shall not go into. They mentioned this problem, and I had the impression that what the proposer of the Bill was saying represents the view of the banks and insurance companies. Is that the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of banks have responded positively to the Bill; they welcome it as clarification. The banks consider the present failure of companies to react to the millennium compliance problem to be especially threatening to their industry—it being a worldwide industry. That is why they welcome the clarification that the Bill would achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
In response to my hon. Friend the Minister's comments that the amendment might produce a greater work load for lawyers, one of the objectives of the Bill is to avoid the legal problems that will arise come the year 2000 when computer systems fail because they have not been retimed, reprogrammed, or replaced so as to recognise the year 2000. People will then wake up and say, "Why? Who was responsible?" The aim of the Bill is to clarify the situation well in advance, and to put the responsibility on those who run companies—company directors—to ensure that their computer systems are properly timed and tested in time so that they, and thus the business, will not be vulnerable come the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the essential aim and merit of the Bill, which I feel that my hon. Friend the Minister and his Department have not yet sufficiently recognised. I hope to persuade my hon. Friend to do so, instead of threatening to kill my Bill, as he has already done today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The need to anticipate difficulties is the chief reason why we ought to applaud the hon. Gentleman. It will be a fat lot of good trying to solve these problems in the spring of 1999, and he has therefore done the House a service. I should like to ask the Minister what advice has the Department received from banks and big insurance companies. The Department must have taken legal advice and received advice from the big corporate institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister will, no doubt, respond to the hon. Gentleman's question in due course. I shall continue to respond to my hon. Friend the Minister's comments on the amendments. As he rightly said, of course I had problems in drafting the Bill because we are dealing with a whole new area—information technology is pioneering stuff. Not only did I seek appropriate legal advice on the drafting of the Bill but, as I have said time and again, I consulted those whom the Bill would affect, such as the top 100 companies and others. I have moved the amendments in response to their professional advice and expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister said, the amendment goes to the heart of the Bill. It would isolate the computer systems that we want to ensure are millennium compliant from all the computer systems that a company owns that are not essential to its viability in the year 2000. Under the amendment, the Bill would include only the computer systems that are necessary for a company to continue in business, which would not now recognise the year 2000 but which would do so as a result of the action that company directors would have to take under the Bill. Therefore I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will withdraw his opposition to the amendment and allow it to be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The direct response to the comments of the hon. Member for Linlithgow is that we have not done a legal survey of British companies, whether insurance companies or banks. However, Taskforce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
2000, which my Department set up and funds, includes representatives from a wide section of British industry. It is closely involved with the CBI, which is part of Taskforce 2000 and co-operates closely with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty this morning is that under normal parliamentary procedure the clause stand part debate comes after debates on individual amendments, so I am somewhat constrained in giving clarification. In fact, the Government have consulted widely on this matter, but not in a formalistic way. We are grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East for the work that he has done in writing to so many companies and receiving their responses. However, the picture is clearly mixed in many cases. Barclays, NatWest and Commercial Union are not necessarily pushing out the boat for legislation, but they are aware of the problem; others are more in favour of the Bill. I have already said that, on balance, the Bill is not the right way forward. However, in the context of what I have just said, I will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of delaying the proceedings, but I shall mention two developments that have occurred since the House gave me leave to present the Bill last December. They further justify the need for legislation to deal with the millennium problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the outcome of the DTI-led Taskforce 2000 survey, which was announced two weeks ago at a press conference attended by my hon. Friend the Minister, showed a total lack of progress by British companies in taking action to tackle the problem. The companies that Taskforce 2000 surveyed were approached a second time eight months later, and were asked the same question. The answers are revealing and worrying. Last year, only 15 per cent. of senior managers were aware of the problem; today, 28 per cent. know about it. To some extent, that is encouraging. However, last year 8 per cent. of the companies surveyed had completed an audit, and thus taken action; today, that figure has increased to only 9 per cent. That is depressing. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, it shows a failure to tackle the threat of computer chaos. That confirms my view that there is no alternative to legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Bill has received overwhelming support from the top 100 companies. In the words of this week's 	<i>Sunday Times,</i> "Bosses Back Meltdown Bill". Eighty per cent. of the replies I received in response to consultation with chairmen favoured the Bill, as amended by the Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with a unique problem and it will be in force for only two years. It will help British business to survive the inevitable problems that will arise in three years' time better than businesses in other countries. It will enhance our competitiveness. Surely no hon. Member can object to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Cope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has done a good job in bringing the problem before the House and to a much wider audience. He recently made a speech about it in the Council of Europe. I congratulate him on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To which companies does the Bill apply? I want to avoid placing undue burdens on small companies and businesses. They experience difficulty in dealing with complex regulations and constant changes in the law. I do not wish them to avoid the problem, which can be as great for a small firm that uses computers—and most firms do—as for a large company. Nevertheless, we should lighten the burdens on small companies as much as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Sir J. Cope) for his comments, not least his reference to my speech at the Council of Europe three weeks ago. What he said echoed what was said by the hon. Member for Linlithgow about the effect of this matter on the introduction of the single currency. The hon. Member for Linlithgow favours introduction as soon as possible, but that may be sabotaged, not only by fudging among members countries, but because it will prove impossible to ensure that computer systems are single currency compliant while ensuring that those systems are millennium compliant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two projects will be the largest undertaken in the history of computer systems. To undertake them at exactly the same time in 1999 would fly in the face of reality. As we cannot put back the millennium, only one thing can be done, which is to change the time scale of the single currency's introduction. That is the point that I made at the Council of Europe, and it has not yet been addressed by anyone anywhere else. I am glad that my right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has given me the chance to comment today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon also asked what companies the Bill would apply to. It seeks to amend the Companies Act 1985 and applies to all companies—large or small—that have to abide by that Act. That includes companies whose directors are required to produce an annual report to the shareholders. If the Bill, and its amendments, are enacted, those companies will have to take account of the need for millennium-compliant computer systems as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister and I are trying to promote the essential message that it will be no good waking up on 1 January 1999 to say that 2000 is just 364 days away and something had better be done. It will be too late then. Companies must decide what will need to be done as a result of an assessment of their systems, for which the Bill provides. After that, time will be needed for testing, and that will take about half the time of the whole project. Only then will the shareholders' investment in the relevant companies be safe when the year 2000 comes.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Action is required now, and that is what the Bill provides for. If the Bill is not enacted, I fear that we will encourage complacency and delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Durant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend quoted a recent survey which showed that there had been an increase of only 1 per cent. in action. Why does he think that that is so? He has approached the 100 top companies, and they seem to be aware of the problem. However, they do not seem to be doing anything about it. I suspect that the Government want voluntary compliance, but why, in my hon. Friend's view, are companies aware of the problem but not bothering to do anything?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Simply, it is human nature to tend to put off things that do not require an immediate response. This is a clear example of people thinking that 2000 is still two and three quarter years away, so no immediate action is required. But that flies in the face of the cruel facts of the situation. The only answer that I can offer my hon. Friend is that companies are addressing more immediate problems rather than responding to this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have another answer. I was curious about the same point as the hon. Member for Reading, West (Sir A. Durant). My impression is merely anecdotal, and I cannot prove it, but I have talked briefly to three or four companies and have discovered a feeling that this is someone else's responsibility, the attitude is "for God's sake, don't land me with that. That is my colleague's responsibility." I suspect that they are playing musical chairs to see who has to carry the can for this complicated, time-consuming and worrying operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only echo the hon. Gentleman's remarks. The comments that he has heard are similar to the comment I heard from a senior DTI official who wished that the problem would go away. The problem cannot and will not go away. Therefore, we must respond to it not at the beginning of 1999, but now. That is the purpose behind my Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The companies that are aware of the problem and are taking action realise that they face a question of priority. They realise that, such is the measure of the task before them, they will have to prioritise. They do not have enough time to ensure that all their computer systems become millennium compliant. Therefore, they must decide which are their most important computer systems and ensure that they become millennium compliant. That will avoid some, but not all, of the problems. A new word "triage" has been introduced into the debate and it describes the way in which companies must prioritise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if companies act responsibly by becoming aware of the problem and by taking action to reprogramme or replace their computers, they will face another problem. The computer systems of companies
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
that have acted will be linked to the computer systems of other companies. If the other companies have not taken the same action to make their systems millennium compliant, the systems of the companies that have acted will fall anyway. There will be a domino effect. We must ensure that all computer systems in the country are millennium compliant. If they are not, there will be knock-on effects. That is why the Bill is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the hon. Member for Linlithgow. It has enabled me to emphasise the points that show the need for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Durant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do companies believe that the computer industry will produce a magic chip that one can just bung into the computer to cure the problem? Do companies think in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the magic chip, to which my hon. Friend refers, is known more widely in the industry as the silver bullet. It remains elusive, however. I admit that I am largely computer illiterate even though I have learnt a lot in the past year or so. However, I am aware that a silver bullet is the software that would get to the heart of the problem. It would target the dates in the programmes and would then manipulate them so that they recognise the year 2000. Although some companies suggest that they have found such software, it has, to my knowledge, not yet been discovered. However, an increasing number of computer supply companies have developed software that will help companies to solve the problem. I hope that I have answered my hon. Friend's query.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say again how much I appreciate the work that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East has done to raise this issue. He deserves even more credit because he raised the issue at Prime Minister's Question Time 15 months ago, and he was one of the people who alerted me to the problem. At that time, other voices were talking to me about it, so I decided that we should galvanise ourselves into action. I then had a strange experience for a Minister. I was raising the problem of the year 2000 with chief executives of companies rather than them raising it with me. I was horrified to learn how few of them had ever heard of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to impinge on hon Member's time, but anyone who reads the record of our proceedings might be confused by what we are talking about. I shall therefore explain in the most succinct terms possible that the problem relates to the fact that to save memory in the early days most computer programmes used only two digits for a year. This year, for example, is expressed as "97". In the year 2000, the computer may interpret the double digit "00" as referring to the year 1900, or it may not recognise it at all. It may invent a date, perhaps when the software programme was first applied, or it may just shut down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before hon. Members think that shutting down and then starting again may be the safest option, I point out that it would be unwise to be in a lift on the 20th floor of a building as the midnight hour struck. The lift may have an embedded system and it would be alarming to find out then that there was a problem
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to scaremonger. I merely want to underline the pervasiveness of the problem: there are embedded systems in lifts, in air conditioning, in safety control systems and in aircraft. Many of the main airlines, if really pushed, are beginning to worry about what they may safely do on new year's day in the year 2000 because they may not have had a chance to carry out trials on their computing and embedded systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is not the right place to go into further detail, but I hope that it was helpful to state precisely what is the problem—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman's</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and six Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The size of the problem, therefore, can rapidly be understood. Its impact on any one company is less easy to appreciate. Some companies are heavily computer-dependant, some much less so. Legislation is therefore a slightly blunt instrument. The Department of Trade and Industry has attempted to lead an awareness campaign. I take issue with my hon. Friend on the matter: I chaired the press conference to which he referred as a result of the PA Consulting survey. I entirely endorse his anxiety that only 9 per cent. of companies surveyed completed their audit. The survey showed that 65 per cent. of the organisations surveyed had started their audit, which is a considerable increase on the previous year, and that full or partial awareness among senior management reached 93 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put the matter in a different context and deal with the worries of the hon. Member for Linlithgow and my right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon. Many companies have failed to tackle the matter, first, because of lack of awareness of the problem and, secondly, because the chief executives have failed to get a grip of a problem that is not in essence a problem of technology but of management decisions and resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past 15 months and more I have constantly raised the issue in the House and at meetings in the European Union with the European Community Telecoms Council I have lobbied the Commission, had bilateral discussions with the American Government and considered whether we should raise the issue in the Organisation of Economic Co-Operation and Development and elsewhere. At every stage I stressed the fact that the matter should be dealt with by chief executives if they obtain the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
necessary management resources. My worry is not about the statistics but about the preparedness of companies to make the necessary resources available. When companies start to assess their problem, they first discover that it will take them longer and, secondly, that it will cost them much more money than they expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representatives of Morgan Stanley International, who came to see me the other day, gave me permission to reveal the following figures: the bank's New York partners had calculated that it would cost £55 million to put in order its own operations in respect of its trading ability and its ability to continue to be a computer-based trading operation. It has now employed 200 people specifically for the task at hand. That is one bank in one situation, and it is very concerned about the ramifications elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solution is not so much at hand as a continuance of the awareness campaign using every available weapon. My officials have talked with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales about drawing up rules that may well be applied by auditors throughout the country in asking directors whether they have made a proper and fair representation of the liabilities within the company, and therefore provision within the accounts for correcting this problem. I have intimated to the stock exchange that I think that the directors who have not made clear statements to their shareholders may well be in breach of stock exchange listing requirements. It is not for me to say whether they are or not; I am raising the question as a point of discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have issued a whole series of challenges to the industry, but I will not take time in this Committee to go into them. Anyone who is interested in further information can contact Taskforce 2000, which my Department has set up and funded. I am delighted to say that industry is now sharing in the costs of funding Taskforce 2000, which was always the original intention. Some disparaging remarks have been made about the amount of money that we have put behind that body. In my judgment, taxpayers' money is not intended to solve the problems of the private sector, but it can well be used to promote awareness of the problem and to encourage—through Taskforce 2000 and the work that is now being done in various areas—ways of tackling the problem. Incidentally, the business links system is now gaining the expertise needed to distribute to companies across the country—particularly the smaller companies that my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West mentioned—so that they can grapple with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One key point that comes across in the trawl of the largest companies carried out by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East, is that whether or not they are in favour of legislation, they are all fairly well aware of what is happening. They are keen. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
precisely why the CBI, which is part of Taskforce 2000 and is not changing its publicly identified rules, has said that it considers that further support for the development of initiatives such as Taskforce 2000 is a more effective way of dealing with the problem than legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The supply chain has become crucial. Any company in a supply chain—my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East specifically mentioned this—will not be happy to deal with another part of that supply chain if it is not satisfied that that other company has made its systems compliant, and—here I stress something that never seems to get stressed—compliant in a way that is compatible with others in the supply chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are various ways of dealing with this problem. There is no point in dealing with the problem and then finding that one's solution is not compatible with someone else's. The Bill does not help in that respect, which is why we are encouraging every supply chain to look at that problem. We are beginning to make breakthroughs. BT, for example, has said that it will not deal with a supplier that cannot satisfy BT that it has dealt satisfactorily, and in a compatible way, with the problem. Visa has indicated the same. As it often issues credit cards well in advance, Visa already has difficulties with going beyond the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow raised several concerns. I assure him that the Government take the matter seriously. We have made it quite clear that we will have reviewed our systems by October of this year and will have run trials and corrected our systems by December 1998. I have issued a public awareness warning that it is implausible to believe that the Government, having corrected their systems, will contemplate dealing on an open basis with any computer system that cannot guarantee to the Government that it is compliant with the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some severe warnings for companies to act immediately—in their severity, they go well beyond anything in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained as succinctly as possibly why the Government are not backing the Bill, but also why we warmly welcome all the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East as part of the awareness campaign on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
