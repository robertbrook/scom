</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have circulated a note to all members of the Committee which explains the purpose and background of the amendment, so I do not need to speak at length. Since we last examined such matters during consideration of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 there has been a great devolution of police powers. That process is continuing. To all intents and purposes, the commander at local level—the person in charge most of the time—is the inspector. Superintendents also have increased responsibility, but at divisional level. To make the powers effective, therefore, it is important that the decision at operational level is taken by an inspector. That is the essence of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that Opposition Members have tabled another amendment that would provide additional safeguards if the police wanted to extend the power to stop and search beyond 24 hours. I cannot presume whether the Committee will accept that amendment, but if it were accepted in addition to my amendment, there would be adequate safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say what a pleasure it is to be a member of the Committee dealing with this important Bill? The Committee also has the distinction that, so far, the longest speeches have been made by the Chairman. That is perhaps a measure of the agreement on the Bill and the care taken by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) and those who have supported him in trying to get the Bill right with cooperation across the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to talk about the changes within police structures and their effect on inspectors at operational level. It is important to have safeguards, which is why I seek the Committee's support for amendment No. 16. It would require an inspector making the decision to report immediately to a superintendent, which is according to the normal management structure. If an inspector were going too far beyond the intentions of Parliament, he could, through management supervision, immediately be reined back. That is the sensible balance between decision-making as it now takes place in the police and supervision at the level of superintendent or above.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other part of the safeguard is the fact that the extension of time to a second 24 hours would require the authorisation of a superintendent or above. If the Committee accepts the Minister's amendment and my amendment, it will strike the right balance. I will support the Minister's amendment if amendment No. 16 can also be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diana Maddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 16. Many people are concerned because we are exending the right to stop and search
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
but the amendment will provide more security governing the extension of those powers, so I am happy to support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us that when the Bill, which we all hope will become an Act, is in place, matters will be reviewed from time to time to ensure that the legislation cannot be abused. I am particularly concerned that young people have a negative attitude towards the police. We need to ensure that we are not alienating young people who do not carry knives because we want them to work with the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Committee that the Government will support amendment No. 16 in the name of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and that the matters will be reviewed from time to time. The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) will see from some of the amendment that I will move formally that the police will have to record the reasons for a stop-and-search operation. For example, they will have to say whether it was conducted to search for knives or because of concerns about public safety. Such operations are monitored because the police have to record the total number that they conduct each year and the operations are subject to inspection by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Powers as important as stop and search are always carefully monitored, not least by the police themselves, who are conscious of the dangers they face if there are rumours of the powers being abused. If those rumours are false, it is distressing to the police as well as to parliamentarians.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's amendment and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth are evenly balanced. There was much discussion of the Bill on Second Reading and consultation has taken place with the Police Federations. I therefore accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 7, in page 5, line 36, leave out subsection (3) and insert—
	<br><q><p>'() Subsection (2) (exercise by chief inspector or inspector of power to give authorisation) is repealed.'.—[	<i>Mr. Maclean.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 5, line 41, after 'authorisation)', insert '—
	<br><q><p>() for "the officer who gave the authorisation or to a" substitute "an officer of or above the rank of";'.</p></q>
This is the other part of the balancing exercise. An inspector is the appropriate officer to authorise the exercise of stop-and-search powers for up to 24 hours. If it is necessary to extend them for a further 24 hours, however, it would be appropriate for a more senior officer, such as a superintendent, to take the decision. The arrangement for which we have just voted and that in amendment No. 11 would provide the operational flexibility that is required to respond quickly to events. Authorisation would initially come from an inspector, whereas a senior officer would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
provide a check if the stop-and-search period continued beyond the initial 24 hours. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendments made:</i> No. 8, in page 5, line 41, after 'authorisation)', insert
	<br><q><p>'—() for "incident" substitute "activity";'.—[	<i>Mr. Maclean.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>No. 16, in page 5, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>() After subsection (3) insert—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"(3A) If an inspector gives an authorisation under subsection (1) he must, as soon as it is practicable to do so, cause an officer of or above the rank of superintendent to be informed.".'.—[	<i>Mr. Maclean.</i>]</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 5, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'() In subsection (9) (matters to be specified in authorisations) after "specify" insert "the grounds on which it is given and" '.</p></q>
I speak to the amendment simply to underline the assurance that I gave to the hon. Member for Christchurch. The amendment requires the officer who authorises the use of stop-and-search powers, which he must do in writing, to specify his reasons. It is important that he makes it clear whether he has authorised the stop-and-search exercise because he thinks that incidents of serious violence will occur, as in the original section 60, or because he has a reasonable belief that people are carrying knives. I am sure that both sides of the Committee will welcome the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been much confusion about the Bill's long title. We included the words "stop and search" in it so that we could amend section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and give the police powers that they did not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. You would no doubt agree that it would be inappropriate to offer lavish praise of the work of officials and yourself this morning. Nevertheless, I should like to thank you for your excellent chairmanship of the Committee. Real praise, however, should go to the hon. Member for Provan who has piloted a complicated Bill through the House. The Government have been pleased to assist him with it, but it was his own initiative that brought the measure forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no simple task to change English and Scottish criminal law or to achieve consistency—regarding Ireland and Wales too—throughout the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman has succeeded in introducing two complex areas of law and in handling the complicated politics behind them. Politics has not been much in evidence this morning, but it has been in the past and no doubt will be in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank all members of the Committee, including all Opposition members—particularly the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and the right hon. Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon), as well as the hon. Member for Provan—for their co-operation and help. They have helped to make even better what was a good Bill from the outset. We were all seeking to do something sensible about the problem of knives and we all had problems trying to get the definitions right. We all knew what we wanted to ban if only we could define it properly. If we arrive at even better definitions in future we may all wish to return to the problem once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure before us—in dealing with the marketing of knives and in banning those which are aggressively described as combat knives—is an important step forward. With the sensible extension of stop-and-search powers, the police will have more practical measures on the ground to take against the knife-carrying gangs that we all despise so much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer thanks all round. I look forward to this measure sailing through the other place without too many votes against from any quarter. We should remember that it is not an entirely Home Office-inspired measure so the Lords should let it through without too many further amendments. I end by thanking the hon. Member for Provan once again for his success in steering this excellent Bill through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. May I echo the Minister's congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Provan and say that our discussion today represents only the tip of an iceberg regarding scrutiny across the Chamber? It shows the House at its best. A private Member has brought forward a measure that has massive public support and which addresses an issue that has worried many people both inside and outside the House of Commons for many years.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
I listened to the Minister's welcome for the Bill and it is fair to say that some Opposition Members at least have been convinced for a long time that the matter should be dealt with neatly and tidily. The Minister and I have debated the matter at least twice in the past but have not reached the measure of agreement that we shared this morning. Today's agreement is perhaps a tribute to the golden tongue of my hon. Friend the Member for Provan, who has succeeded in persuading everyone to support a commonsense measure.

Today's proceedings are a small step towards tackling the dangers of the knife culture that has created such a problem in so many of our cities and other parts of the country. I thank everyone involved, but wish to pay special tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Provan. I suggest that the Bill provides a model for parliamentary debate. Back Benchers have been encouraged to take up the issue, and there has been co-operation between Government and Opposition in trying to find the right balance between giving the police the powers that they need while building in the appropriate protections to prevent the misuse of those powers. That lesson could be carried forward to future legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Martin. As the promoter of the Bill I am delighted that we have dealt with the amendments today in a positive and co-operative atmosphere. I hope that the Bill will go through its remaining stages and become the law of the land without delay.

I am especially pleased to have had the good fortune to obtain first place in the ballot for private Member's Bills. That gave me the opportunity to tackle the knife culture and the scandalous way in which some people have sought to promote the possession of combat knives and other weapons with no legitimate purpose. There is no magic wand to end the danger of violence, but the Bill will go some way towards making the streets safer for everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth for their help in improving the Bill without delaying its progress. I am especailly grateful to those hon. Members who supported me as sponsors of the Bill—my right hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow, my hon. Friends the Members for Preston (Mrs. Wise), for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig), for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams), for Sunderland, North (Mr. Etherington), for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood), for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) and for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Cunningham).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to those who supported me on a cross-party basis: the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), the right hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor) and the hon. Member for Christchurch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to thank everyone involved with today's sitting, although I am delighted that no one has been detained too long. I thank the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff, the police and officers of the House. I thank you especially, Mr. Martin, and the Clerk who has advised the Committee on the conduct of proceedings. We can all feel that, through our attendance today, we have made a positive contribution to progress.

Finally, one can get very used to sitting on the Front Bench. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) might be shaking in his shoes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my congratulations to the hon. Member for Provan on his success in steering the Bill so far? I have been through the process and so know just what it entails and how difficult it can be. Sometimes one is successful, sometimes not: I have been successful once and unsuccessful on another occasion. I know that it takes much hard work and soul searching to find something on which everyone can agree, but I agree with the Minister of State. He spoke about the nature of the cross-party support for the Bill and said that such support is an example of the House at its best. I hope that such co-operation happens more often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Provan for his kind remarks, and for his comments about the hard work of the officers of the House, the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers and the Clerk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pay my own tribute to my hon. Friend. We grew up not far from each other and have known each other for a long time. He was brought up in the Gorbals district of Glasgow, which has produced many fine Members of Parliament, while I was brought up in the Anderston district, just over the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
It is the ambition of every hon. Member to put legislation on the statute book. Many hon. Members reach high office without ever achieving that ambition, but my hon. Friend has been able to do so with a Bill that will help ordinary, decent men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Long before my hon. Friend entered the House, he served it in a way, because he was the parliamentary agent for a much-loved former hon. Member, Mr. Frank McEhone, who was loved by every person in the House, and for the late Bob McTaggart, who is still remembered in Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was always able to put colour into the Glasgow political scene. I remember that when all of us had to go down and lodge a deposit prior to the general election, we turned up with our agents and walked into the office but the parliamentary agent for Frank McEhone turned up with him in a pony and trap, which was driven by a war veteran wearing all his medals. Guess who got front-page coverage in the Glasgow newspapers, thanks to my hon. Friend? I also recall being told as a young councillor in the city chambers, "You'll be all right as long as you stay away from Jimmy Wray". It did not turn out that way—we became the best of friends. Glasgow city chambers was a very colourful place, thanks to Councillor Wray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the Bill well in its remaining stages. I am sure that it will be on the statute book before long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
