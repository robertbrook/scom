	<p>[SIR JAMES HILL 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Road Traffic Reduction Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Keighley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I am sorry to interrupt our proceedings so early, but members of the Committee are faced with a difficult problem. It will not have escaped your notice that the amendments to the Bill would have the effect of re-writing it. The promoter of the Bill and my hon. Friend the Minister have had discussions since it was debated on Second Reading, as a result of which amendments have been tabled that would create an entirely different Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that amendments cannot be tabled to new clauses. In other words, we shall not be discussing amendments that are relevant to how the Bill might emerge from Committee. There will be an opportunity on Report to discuss amendments to the Bill in its new form. However, because of the parliamentary timetable, we do not know how much time will be available for further debate. The Bill that emerges from Committee will certainly be different from that which was presented to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So that we can fulfil our proper role of parliamentary scrutiny, it might be advisable to provide an opportunity for organisations outside the House that are concerned with the environment, planning and transport to study the amendments and the new clause before the Bill is debated in Committee. Would not it be appropriate, therefore, to adjourn the Committee at this stage? Given that the amendments and the new clause were tabled as recently as Monday of this week, there has been no opportunity for organisations outside the House to assess their impact and to make their views known to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Greenway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Everyone will sympathise with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) in that scrutiny of a Bill is fundamental to its acceptance into law by the House and our society. I have two problems with my hon. Friend's argument. First, although the amendments were tabled on Monday, which, I accept, is late in the day, that is common practice. It is difficult to argue that the Committee has been hijacked and such an argument does not stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Bill is of such importance that I hope there will be no impediment to it, bearing in mind the great importance of getting the spirit and intention of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
the Bill into law. It may mean making a compromise, but that is the way of the world and of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. No one would accuse my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) of trying to frustrate the message of the Bill or the work that could be carried forward were it to become law. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Greenway) spoke of compromise. The best understanding of that word is agreement. If the Bill's hijacker can also be its promoter, we should not be too worried, especially if we are all willing participants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that those who object to the proposed improvements to the Bill—an improved Bill is better than one that is not improved—would prefer to keep some of the specific targets and dates. If they feel strongly about the matter, there will be the opportunity to make suggestions in another place or on Report, although an extended Report stage might result in the death of the Bill and thus no legislation on road traffic reduction in this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would probably be in keeping with Standing Orders, and with the mood of the Committee, to proceed and to discover whether the amendments and the new clause would improve the Bill. Most of us, on both sides of the argument and both sides of the House, would prefer progress to be made. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister for Railways and Roads and the promoter of the Bill, the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), on their consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Road traffic reduction is immensely important. During the past 18 years, the Government have proposed no such legislation. If they had, we should have had time to deal with the points made this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken this private Member's Bill as far as we can. I see no reason for delay in putting it on the statute book. Detailed negotiations have taken place to find a common line; we should proceed on that basis, although the Bill will not include as much as I should like. Certainly I do not want an adjournment or other delay, because it would stop anything getting to the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Keighley is wrong in his belief that the amendments and new clause will fundamentally change the Bill. Were he to study the 	<i>Official Report</i> of the Second Reading debate, he would know that the Minister proposed a number of changes to the Bill and explained some of his worries. The hon. Gentleman will know also that I made it clear when winding up on Second Reading that I understood many of those worries and was willing to deal with them in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Keighley referred to concerns that have been expressed by other organisations. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
will know that those concerns have been taken into account in the amendments. I hope that the Committee will proceed rapidly to debate amendments that will make the Bill more acceptable to all Members of the House and to many of those organisations to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully. I received a letter this morning from the Ford Motor company on parliamentary relations, so I am sure that those who wanted to write have already written.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was plenty of time to table amendments to the amendments. I am told by the Clerk that the new clause was tabled yesterday, so there has been time to table amendments to that. In any case, I am sure that the Committee will thoroughly discuss the new clause. We shall see what comes from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not prepared to accept a dilatory motion. Adequate notice was given and we must now make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have dealt with that point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a different point of order, but it arises from the comments that you, Sir James, have just made. I was advised that amendments to amendments could not be tabled, but you have just said that there was time to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard a whisper that you were given incorrect advice. We must be careful in this place because we receive much incorrect advice from time to time. We must make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>INTERPRETATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 6, leave out from "say" to end of line 10 and insert—
	<br><q><p>" 'local road traffic' means traffic consisting of mechanically propelled vehicles on roads for which the Secretary of State is not the traffic authority".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 2, in page 1, leave out lines 12 to 21 and insert
	<br><q><p>"any council which is a local traffic authority;</p></q>
	<br><q><p>'traffic authority' and 'local traffic authority' have the meaning given by section 121A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to repeat the debate on Second Reading; I am sure that you, Sir James, would rule me out of order if I tried to do so. However, it is important to explain that these amendments and others which we shall debate later have been tabled in the light of comments by many hon. Members, including the Minister, on Second Reading. As I said earlier, I made it clear on Second Reading that I was extremely anxious that a Bill on road traffic reduction should reach the statute book, as that would be a major
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
change of policy. Therefore, I was willing to work with the Minister and hon. Members from all parties to produce amendments that would give the Bill a fair wind in Committee and during its other stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some might argue that elements of the Bill have been lost. Certainly, under the amendments, we shall lose reference to national targts. Many people would like there to be national targets, but I think that they are matters for later. I still think that the Bill, as I hope it will be amended in Committee, will make a substantial difference to the amount of traffic on our roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely grateful to the Minister and his officials for the work that they have willingly done to help to prepare the amendments. Amendment No. 1, would widen the Bill's definition of road traffic to include all forms of motorised transport and, therefore, would delete the term "public transport" from the Bill. The decision to exclude public transport is based on the fact that private cars and lorries make up the bulk of traffic on our roads. We hope that local authorities will concentrate on the reduction of that traffic when setting targets. However, I understand that it would be useful for councils to review all types of road traffic in their areas before deciding whether to set targets. Consequently, I accept that it makes sense to widen the definition of road traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 2, it was originally intended that the Bill would place a duty on a range of local authorities to draw up plans and set targets, so that councils at all levels would recognise the need to pay proper attention to traffic levels. However, on reflection, I recognise that there are benefits to be had from not extending that duty to all tiers of councils with overlapping areas of responsibility. Therefore, I was convinced by the Minister's suggestion that the duties proposed in new clause 1—which I hope will become clause 2—should be confined to local traffic authorities, although, importantly, they would have to consult widely with other tiers of government in reviewing traffic levels and drawing up reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendments and look forward to the debate on the new clause with which they are linked. For those who follow our proceedings, it is worth noting that, in our final considerations during Committee, we shall leave the words "for related purposes" in the long title. I am glad that we are retaining lines 1 and 2 and line 11 of clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) say whether, if a mechanic—or any other person—is bicycling, that counts as a mechanically propelled vehicle? Is cycling included?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Railways and Roads (Mr. John Watts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment upon the inclusion of public transport in the categories of motorised transport to be considered in drawing up reports. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) explained, that does not mean that we expect local authorities to draw up plans to reduce the use of public transport. Indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
I suspect that as part of a plan to reduce traffic generation through other modes—the car and so on—it may be appropriate for local authorities to set a target for increasing the use of buses. That will be made clear in the guidance that we shall issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to amendment No. 2, we agreed that it was better to focus the responsibility for preparing reports and setting targets on the traffic authorities. However, as the hon. Member for Bath said, the guidance will spell out the need for wide consultation in preparing such plans, including consultation with other tiers of local government, the business community and other interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the chairmanship of this most important Committee, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of walking, cycling and public transport is crucial. Our real problems stem from the fact that we do not have an integrated transport network or strategy, so the guidance that will be issued by the Government will be crucial. As to strategic transport planning and the finances that will be made available for it, I want to make certain that the Government's planning guidance will ensure that all modes of transport and the ways in which they interconnect—I include walking, cycling and motorcycling—are fully taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Bill because I represent an area that suffers from some of the worst traffic congestion in the country. I am confused about one aspect of the Bill, to which clause 1 seems particularly relevant. How do the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment and their counterparts at local level—in my constituency, the planning and highway departments of the county authority of Kent—relate to each other? I have had only a brief chance to look at the drastic changes that we shall consider later, but, while we are discussing the general definitions, I should express my concern that we do not create crossings of responsibility and duty that could generate confusion and extra administration and paperwork at local government level. The Bill is important and many of my constituents want it adopted, but I am anxious for assurances that it will not create a conflict of duties between the two parallel areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to members of the Committee for those contributions. Like the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley), I believe that it is vital that there be clear reference to all forms of transport in the Government guidance,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern about cycling is easily answered. As the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) knows only too well, it is not intended that cycling be included, but as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North rightly pointed out, cycling and its promotion will be an important way to reduce the amount of traffic on our roads. As a result of the Bill, examples of good practice that will appear in some local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is vital that local authorities make plans to instil early habits of cycling and walking, especially among children travelling to school, and that local plans should include examples of safe routes to school and other ways to encourage children to take up those habits at the earliest possible stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. I for one have welcomed the work of the organisation "Safe Routes to Schools", which has in my constituency and neighbouring areas tried to develop the sorts of initiatives to which she refers. The critical thing to remember is that the definitions contained in the amendments would place the duty on highway authorities—as the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) mentioned—to prevent confusion between the different tiers of government. As I said earlier, it is vital that highway authorities consult widely with other tiers of government, because they will want to have a say on various issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that consultation will go wider than other local councils. It is important, for example, that there be consultation with businesses in the area. We must acknowledge that in some areas of the country there may be, for economic development reasons, a need to increase traffic growth in an area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely take the hon. Gentleman's point about vertical consultations. However, my point related to horizontal consultation. Who within a local authority is supposed to be responsible for the plan: the highways department or the planning department? That is not an arcane point, because the planning department is answerable to the Department of the Environment for its planning arrangements, whereas the highways department will, under the Bill, be answerable to the Department of Transport. If two parts of the same authority are answerable to two different Secretaries of State under separate legislative frameworks, it could create much confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but he will be aware that different councils choose to organise themselves in different ways. It would not be appropriate to include in the Bill any instructions to councils about how they are to organise themselves. The duty will be placed on the council, and it will be for the council itself to determine how it will produce the report. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that, if there happens to be a highways department and a planning department in a particular council, consultation and discussion between those departments will be most important. Planning issues will clearly play an important part in the impact that the plans will have on traffic in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. It is important that the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport match what happens at local level to create strategic plans. The report

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
published earlier this week by the United Kingdom Round Table on Sustainable Development, "Getting Around Town", makes precisely that point. It is important that, when considering guidance, transport Ministers work in tandem with the Department of the Environment. We need one message about sustainable transport to come through from the top to the bottom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Government have welcomed the report, and would argue—although it is not for me to respond on behalf of the Minister or the Government—that in the past two or three years they have increasingly come to the same view as the report: out-of-town planning can increase the amount of traffic in an area. I shall give a local example. I am extremely concerned about some out-of-town shopping developments that are proposed outside my constituency. They would not only increase traffic in the vicinity but have a devastating effect on the local economy, and I am concerned about such planning for two reasons. As the hon. Member for Canterbury, said it is important that the council department which is responsible for drawing up the plan and passing it to the Department consults with other departments, and that the planning department is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North and the Committee to know that the planning guidance that deals with matters such as out-of-town shopping—PPG 13—is a joint policy issued by my Department and the Department of the Environment. Yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport announced that we are bringing trunk road planning within the regional planning guidance system, precisely so that the roads for which we are directly responsible can be planned alongside land use planning at regional level. Therefore, we are moving in that direction nationally, and I am sure that local authorities will have no problem replicating that move locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Bill as amended will impose any burdens other than the work that ought already to be done when composing transport plans—such as monitoring traffic and becoming aware of the consequences of investment decisions. Any well-substantiated bid for resources would already include such background information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will disagree to clause 2 and pass new clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is at the heart of the matter; it is the most critical part of our debate. The new clause makes the Bill somewhat different from that which we discussed on Second Reading. Clause 2 imposes a duty on councils to draw up road traffic reduction plans containing targets for reducing traffic volume or rates of traffic growth. The new clause would place upon councils the duty to prepare a report. I am always surprised by the fact that the Department
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
appears to be unhappy with using the word "plan" in such circumstances, and insists on the word "report". Nevertheless, there seems little difference between them, and I am happy to accept the use of the word "report".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause will place on councils a duty to prepare a report examining existing and forecast levels of road traffic in their area and to consider whether to set targets to reduce them. It will also oblige them to publish their reports and submit copies to the Secretary of State. Finally and importantly, it makes it clear that the Secretary of State may issue appropriate guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will recognise, the new clause introduces an element of flexibility into the process of setting targets, as it envisages that authorities should set targets for reducing traffic or that they may decide against setting targets in the light of their reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some may argue that that is a watering down of the original proposal, but that is not the case. The Minister made it clear on Second Reading that there could be some circumstances—perhaps relatively few—in which, having conducted a review, the local authority decided that it was inappropriate to set targets for road traffic reduction. As hon. Members will realise, if authorities choose not to set targets, they must publish their reasons and submit them to the Secretary of State for approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the detail of clause 2 has been removed from the Bill, but that does not mean that it has been lost. After much discussion with the Minister, I have agreed that, rather than some of that detail appearing in the Bill, issues such as consultation and the measures necessary to achieve targets would be more appropriately covered in the separate guidance that the Minister will issue to local authorities. The Minister has helpfully circulated to all members of the Committee an outline of the areas that such guidance is likely to cover. As the Committee will see, much of that derives from clause 2. The Bill makes it clear that, in drawing up their plans, authorities must take note of the guidance that will be circulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that anything has been lost. Much of the original content of clause 2 is still alive, as it will be contained in the guidance that authorities must take into account when drawing up their plans. I have no doubt, Sir James, that if the Minister catches your eye, he may want to give us a little more detail of his thinking on the clause. In particular, I hope that he will refer to the proposed guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's main concern with clause 2 is that in its adoption of a rather inflexible and prescriptive approach, which would require all principal councils to draw up road traffic reduction plans and to set targets for reducing traffic levels or rates of growth, it fails to recognise that circumstances may differ from one part of the country to another and, indeed, within a single authority's area of responsibility. The needs of a largely rural authority
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
may differ from those of an urban one and the case for having targets relating to a specific conurbation may be quite different from that for the whole of a shire county's area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that in some locations other highly worthwhile initiatives may result in traffic growth. I am thinking specifically of places where regeneration programmes are under way—I mentioned one example on Second Reading. Local authorities have to balance the damaging effects of traffic against other considerations, such as the speed at which viable alternatives might come on stream and the need to promote good accessibility and foster economic growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause places a duty on local authorities to review traffic levels on local roads in their area and to forecast growth. When they have that information, they can consider whether targets for reducing traffic levels or traffic growth have a useful role to play in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should stress that, in giving local authorities the option of deciding whether to set targets, we do not intend that they should take the issue lightly. It will not be acceptable, for two reasons, for an authority simply to say it does not agree with such measures and that it will not set targets. First, subsection (5) of the new clause would make it clear that authorities would be obliged to explain in their reports their reasons if they decide not to set targets. Secondly, I expect to sound a suitable cautionary note in the guidance to be issued under subsection (6) of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the detail under clause 2 could be covered more usefully in guidance notes. As the hon. Member for Bath mentioned, members of the Committee have already seen a rough draft of them. Covering such issues in guidance notes, rather than in the Bill, does not mean that we regard them as less important than other measures. Indeed, subsection (6) of the new clause makes it clear that local authorities
	<br><q><p>"shall have regard to any guidance when preparing a report."</p></q>
In particular, the guidance will make clear the importance of local authorities consulting on the setting of targets. The new clause would retain the obligation for local authorities to publish their reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another crucial advantage of that approach is that it will allow us time to consider with local authority associations the detailed mechanics of how it will work. It would be a mistake to take an over-prescriptive approach in the Bill, only to risk finding that we had imposed in legislation something that is not workable. The new clause would also place a duty on authorities to submit their reports to the Secretary of State who will, in turn, lay them before Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister for his attitude to the Bill. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Bath who also presented the Bill in previous Sessions. I am sure that we all acknowledge that the Bill was less fashionable a couple of years ago and that it has required all-party interest and interaction with the Department of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
Transport for it to reach the stage when it is likely to pass through Parliament, as a result of which all interested parties deserve praise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too many villages, towns and cities are bedevilled by too much traffic. The amount of traffic will increase because each cohort drives more frequently than before and has a greater opportunity to own cars because of the rise in the standard of living. In Eltham, my present constituency, the housing estates that were built 20 years ago have no provision for cars. It was assumed at the time of planning that council tenants could not afford to buy cars and that, if they had driving licences, they would drive vehicles only in their roles as delivery drivers or workers in the building trade, and not for domestic purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the constituency for which I shall be a prospective parliamentary candidate, nearly 50 per cent. of people are above retirement age. A growing proportion of people who will replace them will be car owners and will expect to drive for much of their retirement. There is nothing wrong with that. The real problems are caused by those who could easily substitute journeys in cars by travelling by foot, accessible public transport or those who, for that matter, could shorten their journeys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) mentioned schools. It is not just a matter of finding safe and accessible routes to schools which children can use by themselves or in groups, but of continuing to improve schools so that more people are happy for their children to attend those near to their homes. In my 20-odd years as a Member of Parliament, the biggest change that I have noticed is that nearly all teachers drive to school. That did not happen 20 years ago; they either lived closer to the schools or used public transport to get to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not everyone can change his job or his place of residence, but we should be encouraging shortening the distances that people commute from their homes to work. Those who have the opportunity of moving home or changing their work should aim to reduce the amount of time between the two, rather than continue suffering from the twin perils of alienation and anomie. Some people cannot bear to be at home, so they leave at 6 o'clock in the morning; they cannot bear to get to work so they spend three hours driving round on the M25 listening to the radio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities can provide a focus in the community, not to impose their will on residents or those who visit the area but to get people to think about what they are doing and to think what changes are possible. Not all change is immediately welcome. For instance, when Westminster City council altered traffic arrangements outside Buckingham palace, the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> ran a ludicrous campaign saying for months that that change would do harm. In practice, however, it has done good. Similar arrangements would help in Parliament square and Trafalgar square, where allowing two-way traffic on three sides would provide more capacity than one-way traffic on four sides—a simple change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was discovered some years ago that motorcyclists and cyclists were in more danger in cities and towns
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
with roundabouts. As a result, places such as Cambridge removed many roundabouts, which has improved safety for those who use alternative forms of transport. It is important to spread that sort of insight. Making the roads safer for pedestrians and those who travel by cycle or motorbike is as important as bearing down on motorists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the Government against the crazy idea of raising money through motorway tolling. We know already that the greatest diversions would be at night, when the motorways are least crowded, but we know also, for example, that Cambridge could not take the traffic that would divert from the M11. We want to continue using our special roads and to keep their special attraction. Raising money by increasing fuel duty would be far more sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who believe that congestion charging is a sensible way to reduce traffic in towns should think again. Most of those who commute by public transport to the City of London have cars and a fistful of fivers. If they were offered the chance to use their fivers to buy spaces on the roads for their own one and a half ton steel waistcoats, they would crowd the roads more than if we made public transport more attractive. We have learnt plenty of lessons already. Let us not forget them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Cousins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak directly about new clause 1. I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I do not engage in the normal courtesies and preliminaries of such debates. However, I would like to place on record my respect and admiration for the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis), whose work on this matter has been an example to us and to all parliamentarians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 will repay a certain degree of specific examination. For example, clause 2 lays the duty to prepare plans directly upon local authorities. In new clause 1, that duty is mediated through the Secretary of State for Transport and his request that such plans be prepared. How will the Secretary of State use those intermediary powers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 also imposes a duty on local authorities to prepare plans within one year of the coming into force of the Bill. I wish to be entirely clear about the Minister's intentions on timing before allowing that particular point to be struck out of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 clearly refers to measures to be undertaken to secure delivery of those targets. Such a reference is not to be found in new clause 1. The Minister said that he intends to cover many of the details of clause 2 in the proposed guidance. If that guidance contains a clear reference to those measures, even if it is not in exactly the same terms, I should be happy to forgo clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been said, new clause 1 will give the local authorities on which the duty to prepare plans will be laid the option to say that they do want to do so. The Minister and the hon. Member for Bath have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
assured us that those authorities will have to give reasons for saying that. I would like the Minister to say what guidance he proposes to give to local authorities on what reasons would be acceptable for saying that an area should be exempted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath said that local authorities would, of course, have to report on their decision not to prepare plans and that that would be subject to the Secretary of State's approval. However, new clause 1, in fact, contains no reference to the approval or disapproval of those reports by the Secretary of State. That is an interesting and important point, and I want to be clear about it before sacrificing clause 2. I hope that the Minister and the hon. Member for Bath can put our minds at rest about those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As has already been said, new clause 1 represents the nub of the Bill, as it is intended to emerge into the public domain. I yield to no one in my commitment to the environment, although I fear that people often forget that we are talking about the people's environment and that, essentially, people's quality of life is one of the key factors that must be taken into account when considering the environment. However, I consider myself part of the environmental lobby in its broadest possible sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, major problems result from traffic. Motor vehicles have brought enormous benefits to people during the 20th century, but they can of course be the enemy of people if they are not kept under control and in their proper place. The achievements of Governments during this century should not be underestimated when considering people's quality of life and the aspirations of so many people to have personal mobility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, it was said that traffic would most likely double during the next 25 to 30 years. It is fair to say that the most recent assessments state that traffic is less likely to increase at that rate in future years. However, the problem still needs to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the Bill is more about wish fulfilment than practicable measures. In many ways, it is bureaucratic and unworkable. I want a different approach to be adopted. My concern increased when I read the discussion draft of possible guidance to local authorities that the Minister has proposed. Many of the measures proposed in part V of that document, although extremely desirable, are not achievable without the production of proposals for suitable bypasses. There is not the slightest reference in the discussion draft to the role that new bypasses and relief roads can play in improving the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many towns, parking, pedestrian zones, restraint measures, passenger information, a better environment for cycling and walking and improved public transport are dependent on new bypasses. I know of many towns where bypasses are urgently demanded because people are unable to walk or cycle safely and buses are held up in traffic and cannot
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
move freely. I regret that not a word has been said about the role of bypasses, despite the fact that more than 200 communities in this country hope to have a bypass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of the Bill is that it might represent an end to all road improvements, including the bypass building programme. Under the Bill, it will be more difficult to build bypasses which might, in certain circumstances, generate small amounts of extra traffic in some areas while reducing it in others. Such an outcome would be contrary to the views of many local people. In many cases, the majority of local people support bypass construction because it draws traffic from town centres and, hence, reduces urban congestion. The reduction of congestion must be our ultimate objective, rather than the simple consideration of traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If enacted, the Bill would not make up, as some more starry-eyed people would like to believe, for the lack of money available for improving public transport, providing cycleways and better pedestrian environments and building bypasses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise the need for cleaner, safer vehicles. In many ways, what the motor industry has achieved, and hopes to achieve, is more significant to the quality of the environment, especially the atmosphere, than many of the measures on which the Bill concentrates. My fear is that target setting, if adopted nationally or locally, might be used as a straitjacket, not as a door to a more environmentally beneficial future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reference in new clause 1 to the need to consider specific roads. Subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) of new clause 1 contain no reference to specific roads; they refer, in effect, merely to specific areas. There should be some sort of road hierarchy. It is not sufficient just to look at areas; the right traffic must be put on the right road. Capacity improvements must be funded as well as traffic mitigation measures on primary roads and traffic reduction and calming measures on roads lower down the hierarchy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, some enlightened local authorities could use the Bill in the way that some of us would like it to be used; others will use it as a means of frustrating the wishes of those who want new road developments to improve their environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not yet discussed the new clause with the planning and highways department of Bradford council, but I know that it was concerned about the resources that might be required to draft the sort of plans proposed under the Bill as it stands. The department was fearful that the Bill would create new work in acquiring information, establishing targets and drafting plans. It was also fearful that significant new resources would be required to put those plans into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the Bill's measures to reduce traffic are already being pursued by local authorities as part of their transport policy. Some authorities that are involved in best practice will find that they are hampered rather than helped by the bureaucratic structure that will be imposed on them and that may be duplicated elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
Let me refer to a particular situation, as it is very easy to talk about theoretical outcomes. The town of Bingley, which lies just outside my constituency, could soon become as well known as Newbury and Fairmile—protestors are already digging in at the Keighley south bog. The matter will be an issue at the forthcoming general issue, as it should be. The Bingley relief road scheme on the A650 is popular with local people and businesses; indeed, the Keighley business forum put it at the top of its list of priorities in the agenda that it is preparing in the approach to the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has only to walk up the main street in Bingley to realise why a relief road is needed. The street is unsatisfactory for vehicles and people. Many of the shops are doing badly and many are empty; it is not a good place for shopping. I want to improve the environment there in its broadest sense, and I want to improve road safety, as the level of casualties is significantly higher than the average for trunk roads. The quality of the atmosphere is appalling, largely because the traffic through the town centre is slow moving. It would be far more desirable to have a relief road along which traffic can move at a reasonable and constant speed—we all know that the maximum emissions are released when traffic is moving at walking pace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I challenge anyone to say how the problems of a town such as Bingley can possibly be solved except by constructing a bypass or relief road. A question that I tabled recently evinced the response that the cost to industry of congestion in that one small town because of the lack of the relief road, which has already been long delayed, is more than £1 million per annum. That is typical for many of our towns. There is no real alternative to the construction of a relief road or bypass combined with measures to make the town more pedestrian friendly, cycling friendly and people friendly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the discussion draft makes no reference to such a strategy. That makes me fear that the Bill and the guidance, which ignores the need in some—certainly not in all—circumstances to construct roads, will lead to disaster and will not benefit the environment. I speak as someone who in his time has appeared at public inquiries to object to roads—I am thinking in particular of a scheme on the A65 at Manor Park—as well as someone who has wanted new roads to be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to be realistic about the Bill and the new clause. We must recognise that we will not do anything to reduce traffic simply by proposing traffic reduction plans. We need also to consider the need for new road construction as well as local measures to achieve our objective to alleviate congestion, so that we can reduce the costs to industry and improve air quality and people's environment. If we accept that, we are on the right road. Many of those who are in favour of the Bill do not accept it, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the Bill could become an objector's charter, hold up improvements, and thus cease to be something that would benefit the environment. That is my main anxiety about the new clause, which I hope will be allayed before the Bill progresses further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak briefly on the new clause, which will form a major part of the Bill if it is accepted, as I hope it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the measure has come so far; as the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) said, two years ago the ideas expressed were nothing like as popular as they are now. I never dreamt at that time that a Road Traffic Reduction Bill would get anywhere near to going through Parliament and I pay tribute to the Government for their willingness to find a way of starting the momentous process of a change in culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change is widely reflected in public opinion: a majority want the process that the Bill will encourage to be implemented. Cars are needed in my rural constituency, but, in the past year or so, many people have brought to my attention their anxiety about the amount of traffic going through their villages. In the past two years, some kind of threshold has been crossed that has begun to make traffic intolerable in places that hardly noticed it before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My local authority, in its former guise as the Ceredigion district council, expressed support for the Bill, which should take account of the needs of rural areas. The fact that it had the support of a rural local authority suggests that a strategy is needed in country places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal would provide different authorities with a flexible framework and allow a variety of interpretation. It would encourage local authorities by requiring them to concentrate their minds on this important topic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain anxious that authorities may not be required to set targets and I would like the Minister to say more about that matter. Authorities that do not set targets either for traffic reduction or for the reduction of traffic growth should be the exception rather than the rule. There are few places in which there is no opportunity to reduce traffic flow. I want to know more about the circumstances in which the Government might allow exceptions to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would allow variations in targets in different local authorities throughout the country. That is perfectly reasonable, but it is important that local variations should be allowed in relation only to an overall commitment to reduction of traffic or of traffic growth, especially in respect of by-passes, which we discussed earlier. I do not deny the need for by-passes in certain cases, but, if a bypass is allowed, we know from experience that additional traffic will be generated. A decision to allow one needs to be taken in the context of a general commitment to reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the difference between reduction in traffic, and a reduction in its growth, it is important that the guidance makes it clear that the former is preferable—that our first course should be to reduce traffic. If that is not possible, the fallback position is a reduction in growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
As for consultation, a list of organisations is given in the draft guidance, which also mentions "others". I was hoping that the Minister would give a commitment that those others would include environmental organisations because, between them, they manage to bring together a great deal of originality and practical understanding of mechanisms for traffic growth. Transport 2000 is, in a sense, an environmental organisation but there are others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reports should include attempts by local authorities to describe the environmental impact of existing traffic and the anticipated reduction in impact as a result of measures taken by local authorities. That would be most useful because the one concept that we need to put our heads to is that of the ecological footprint. Local agenda 21 processes should constantly increase our awareness of the ecological footprint of each individual and community. Guidance should therefore require local authorities to prepare an estimate of the environmental impact, and reduction of impact, following the implementation of proposals. Guidance should also require local authorities to describe in detail the measures that they intend to take, first, to show that they have explored and considered them—they might, in certain circumstances, even include a by-pass—and, secondly, because they are a way of informing local people of what is happening and of amassing good practice to share with other authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my words of welcome, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill and congratulate the hon. Member for Bath on his good fortune in securing a sufficiently high place in the private Member's ballot to bring the Bill before the House with a reasonable chance of success. I also acknowledge the work done of the hon. Member for Ceredigion in his sustained efforts to get such a Bill through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 relates to local targets. I am sorry that no national targets have been proposed because such important issues as bus deregulation, rail privatisation and the balance of subsidy between public and transport obviously affect traffic growth and make it difficult for local authorities to take effective action when they act in isolation from the Government. However, I realise the concessions that the hon. Member for Bath had to make to give the Bill a moderate chance of success. Even in its modified form, it is certainly better than nothing. Hence my support for new clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eltham spoke at length about my constituency and about the appalling congestion in Cambridge for several years. I welcome his conversion and that of Cambridgeshire's Conservative councillors to the cause of road traffic reduction. When I was a member of Cambridgeshire county council from 1985 to 1989 the moves to reduce traffic were consistently opposed by Conservative county councillors, particularly moves to get park and ride in place, which we saw as one of the principal ways of reducing congestion in Cambridge. I am glad that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
there has now been a conversion and even Conservative councillors feel that this is the only possible solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons for that conversion is that it is quite obvious to us all that traffic moves much more slowly now than in the past. I cannot say that I am sorry about that, although I recognise that it causes time loss to businesses and often great inconvenience to people. However, it is one of the few things that will persuade people to walk, cycle or take some other form of transport. The fact that traffic moves slowly may have converted some to the cause which must be partially welcomed by those who have been long converted to the cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a money resolution to the Bill and although we are not referring to it in the clause and are talking about local authority targets, expenditure in this area, such as on improvements to cycle ways, pedestrian precincts and so on, will involve a minor amount of expense. But reducing air pollution could save the national health service a great deal of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am an asthma sufferer and spend a great deal on NHS prescriptions. I am aware that I do not pay the full cost through those prescription charges. However, we are talking not only about the expense, but about the inconvenience and real distress to individuals. That must be an important impetus to reduce road congestion and traffic pollution. Reducing road traffic is essential if we are to meet our carbon dioxide emission targets. Emissions from road traffic are increasing while CO2 emissions are tending to decline from every other source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention some of the measures that local authorities can take, and emphasise that those should be mentioned in reports by the principal local authorities. The Minister has already mentioned the growth of out-of-town shopping centres and the importance of integrating planning policy guidance with Department of Transport policy. Hypermarkets on the edge of cities contribute to traffic growth and the report published a couple of weeks ago showed that the policies in place, which were passed under earlier planning policy guidelines, will continue to lead to an increase in car usage for many years to come. That is profoundly depressing. We have to find ways of overcoming that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem is that we have all become such enormous consumers that car-based shopping is often the only feasible option for many people. Shopping facilities in city centres are not generally the most popular because people cannot use their cars to pick up their goods. That is a problem that local authorities must address. It is no good if people cannot carry their goods home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience yesterday illustrates the problem quite well. I walked to the Army and Navy store and bought some curtain rails. I asked whether they could be delivered but found that delivery could only be on a certain day and that I would have to pay extra if I specified morning or afternoon. It was impossible for them to be delivered at a time when I knew that I would be there. That is not acceptable. Many of us cannot sit at home all day waiting for deliveries.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Those are the sort of practical problems that we cannot ignore if we are serious about reducing the amount of traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other major problem is that of children travelling to school. Dealing with that requires the cooperation of not only transport and planning departments, but local education authorities. If children are to cycle to school, it is important that they have adequate facilities at school for parking their bicycles safely and that they learn to cope with traffic at an early age. The "Safe Routes to School" organisation has been mentioned, and its initiative should be promoted. My local authority runs a walk-to-school week so that children acquire and maintain that habit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People travelling to work is another important problem. Better and more frequent public transport is the only way to deal with it even though the better use of telecommunications will make some journeys unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to pay tribute to three organisations in my constituency. In doing so, I emphasise the importance of local authorities working with local businesses and other organisations to promote cycling and sustainable transport policies. First, I pay tribute to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, which has more than 50 per cent. of its employees cycling to work. It is not situated in the city centre, but on the outskirts of Cambridge. It has several hundred employees and it has taken tremendous steps to make traffic reduction feasible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second organisation to which I pay tribute is Cambridge Econometrics, which is another small organisation in my constituency. Until recently, it did not employ any motorists at all and was able to turn its car park into a garden. Again, that is an example to the rest of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pay tribute to Cambridge university, which still bans students from keeping cars in the city. My own good habits stem from the time that I was an undergraduate at Cambridge and I learnt to ride a bicycle in the traffic-free days of 1959. It would be much less safe for me to attempt to ride a bicycle now than it was then, but I am glad to say that I have kept up the habit. I still cycle at least 20 miles and sometimes approaching 50 miles, a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities and national Government should also try to persuade people that motoring short distances is bad for them. That is why the consultation requirements in new clause 1 are particularly important. Changes in people's attitudes and activities are required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak from experience because my husband and I gave up our car in 1988—perhaps I should say that our car gave up on us; it expired on the motorway with a big end problem. We have been able to manage without a car since then. My children always cycle or walk to school; they were never taken to school by car. My husband and I cycle or walk to work and we went on holiday to France by train and used our
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
French bicycles when we were there. We have used taxis only when there has been no other option and hired cars about five or six times a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past nine years, I have obviously had a lot of experience of using public transport, cycling and walking. Recently I returned from Wirral, South and had to make a six-and-a-half hour journey from Chester to Cambridge. That highlights the need to improve public transport, so that such horrendous journeys become much shorter and more convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that I have been able to take part in the debate. Apart from the reservations I expressed earlier, I support the new clause and I hope that the Bill will find its way onto the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few brief comments on new clause 1, which has now become almost the entire Bill. I apologise, Sir James, that I had to be out of the Room for a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make one central point, which stems from what I said earlier. There seems to be a problem in the division of responsibilities and authorities. It is not merely a bureaucratic problem about on whose desk the information lands; it goes right to the public domain and raises issues such as how the public inquiry mechanism should work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I made clear at the outset, I support measures to reduce road traffic. Canterbury has some of the worst road traffic problems in the country. It is peripherally relevant to our debate that one reason for that problem was a mistake made many years ago by an inspector from the Department of the Environment, who allowed a housing development to block the best site for a clockwise bypass around Canterbury. It is not now possible to build a bypass at an affordable cost without intruding enormously into unspoilt countryside. That problem was caused by lack of coordination between Government Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak about my local area, but what I say applies throughout the country. The highways authority for Kent is, of course, Kent county council. In its new clarified form, the Bill clearly is talking about Kent being the highways authority. Kent has a strategic planning department which produces a structure plan, and I recently gave a personal presentation to a public inquiry on a Kent structure plan. However, the planning departments for the area, which cover most planning applications, are the planning departments of the individual city councils. The majority of planning decisions in my area are made by Canterbury city council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The city's structure plan is subject to a proper system of public inquiry, as is the Kent structure plan, in which the interests of the various groups are balanced—for instance, those of people who want to build houses and those who are concerned about commercial development vis-a-vis those who are worried about intrusion into the countryside and those who are concerned about loss of open space in urban areas. Such matters are handled by public inquiries, in which the major focus is the local structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
How does new clause 1 fit in with that structure? I see no reference to public inquiries; the new clause refers merely to "consultation". How will it work? After the vertical discussions mentioned by the Bill's promoter, and after liaising closely with colleagues in the strategic planning department, what scope will the highways authority of Kent county council have to hold a public inquiry? That would have ramifications for planning in my city council area, which is profoundly important. What scope do the public have to make representations before a plan is filed with the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make those points not as someone who is against the Bill—I am anxious to see road traffic reduced, especially in my area—but because of the danger of confusion between the various bodies, which already have interlocking responsibilities. The public could also find it more difficult to make their views known. I should be most grateful if the promoter of the Bill would answer that point. I am sympathetic to his cause, but I am anxious to be reassured on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because I know that we still have other business to get through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at an historic turning point in how we deal with traffic. It was quite unthinkable 10 years ago—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Will the hon. Lady please speak up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at a historical turning point in our approach to traffic and congestion, now that we are dealing with a proposal for traffic reduction. Such all-party consensus about the way forward was not possible 10 years ago. We have progressed a huge distance since 1993, when I tabled a written question:
	<br><q><p>"To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) if he will consider setting targets for traffic flow reductions 	<i>(a)</i> within urban areas and 	<i>(b)</i> on inter-urban roads; and if he will make a statement".—[	<i>Offical Report,</i> 29 June 1993; Vol. 227, c. 425.]</p></q>
Even though the Bill does not do anything like as much as I should want, and though I shall not rest, when it reaches the statute book, as I believe it will, from taking matters further, I believe that we have made progress. The most important thing now is to try to build on what we achieve. I hope that we shall be doing that with the support of Friends of the Earth. It is a matter of great satisfaction to me to see civil servants and mandarins from Friends of the Earth sitting together at the Table—if it is in order for me to refer to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot deal with this country's huge traffic problems other than through partnership with just about everybody. Friends of the Earth and many other organisations have developed the debate greatly, but we cannot rest at the point we have reached. Those points on which we agree must be our base line and we must keep on taking the matter forward, as well as learning to deal with anomalies that arise, such as that which the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier),
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
mentioned, involving possible conflict between planning inquiries and transport issues. Recently, in Flamborough, the enclosure legislation has made it possible for hedgerows to be treated as material considerations in respect of planning inquiries to determine urban development plans. We should ensure that guidance issued by the Minister is prepared in partnership with the Department of the Environment. Both Departments together should develop a policy that has integrity and that means the same thing to each Department of State and local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree with the hon. Lady's sentiments, but surely the key requirement is to establish clearly who is responsible for the work and how the public will be consulted. That was the point that I was trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why much will depend on the guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State and by future Governments. We shall have to keep the issue under close scrutiny as the debate progresses. If the planning guidance that we have been assured will follow turns out to be unworkable or unsatisfactory we shall have to exercise vigilance and press for changes. That would not necessarily require an Act of Parliament. The appropriate result could be achieved quite easily by changes in ministerial guidance. We must ensure that, with the local authority associations, we communicate the impact of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North about the date when the Bill, if it is enacted, will come into force. I understand that certain considerations relating to Wales and Scotland, and involving the Department of the Environment, might make it difficult to give a firm date now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intention is that we should issue the guidance in England as part of the guidance that we issue annually for the transport policies and programme bidding round. I should intend it to form part of the material issued in spring 1998, should the Bill find its way on to the statute book. That is the earliest that we could arrange it. We need to consult local authorities to ensure that we produce something workable. I am already considering the draft guidance that will be issued for the next bidding round. We shall not drag our feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that welcome clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that Wales will not lag behind. Wales is the right size and, through the Welsh Office, has the requisite policy-making coherence for national—in the true sense of the word—targets, which could be built up from local plans. That important opportunity should be grapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
Gentleman's view. I am sure that there will be an opportunity to make that point during the constitutional debate on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given the Committee some assurances, and we must ensure that we hold him to them. I accept that the Minister provided the earliest reasonable, practicable date on which the measure could be introduced. That allows us to take the matter forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want the measure to be watered down through get-out clauses. I do not want councils to be able to avoid a duty to formulate local plans. Although I do not share the Government's view, I understand why they do not support national targets. Local targets are a first step and each local authority should be able to produce them in partnership with business, industry, environmental groups, parents, schoolchildren and other local authorities. Councils should not be able to avoid drawing up reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried by the trend towards exempting planning applications for out-of-town developments and business parks outside city centres from compliance with planning guidance. We must not allow those centres and business parks to be excluded and the amount of new traffic that they generate to be ignored. It will be difficult to deal with that problem but we must face the challenge and find a way to use the consensus that exists throughout the United Kingdom. Everybody who has a stake in the matter or cares about it should sit round a table and discuss methods of nurturing economic developments without creating enormous traffic growth. Such increases in traffic cannot be tolerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local councils currently have to make TPP submissions. The measure will provide a tighter framework in which to draw up the proposals. I deplore the fact that so much local authority work is now undertaken on a competitive basis. Huge resources in engineers departments and planning departments are expended on formulating proposals for competition that never see the light of day. We must return to old-fashioned strategic planning and ensure that local authorities can plan for what best suits their needs. I hope that a new mechanism will enable the TTP proposals to go forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could discuss many issues, but in the interests of getting the measure on the statute book, I confine myself to hoping that the Minister will take account of my comments about planning guidance and that the Bill will not be watered down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Austin-Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Woolwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Eltham and for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North have said that it would have been impossible to have this debate two or three years ago. The subject simply was not fashionable. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North for his perseverance and to environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth, Transport 2000 and others. I pay tribute even to some of the protestors who have raised the issue in a way that may not have found favour with all hon. Members but which has, through conventional and unconventional means,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
rammed home the real dangers that we face unless we reduce traffic and pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eltham will remember that when he was a junior Minister at the Department of Transport, the Government intended to drive a motorway through a site of special scientific interest, doubling road traffic in his constituency and mine. Clearly, the DoT has thought again in light of the general mood that says we cannot go on building roads to satisfy ever-increasing demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, although those plans have been dropped, plans under the Government's design, finance and build initiative propose a road crossing across the River Thames which would increase traffic intolerably in Woolwich and in Eltham. The Bill would strengthen local authorities and communities in resisting such a ludicrous scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Keighley is wrong to suggest that the Bill would prevent the kind of relief roads that he has argued are necessary in certain parts of the country. Any action we take has conflicting consequences and almost any relief road or bypass would increase traffic levels. However, they could also reduce air pollution that arises from congestion. The draft guidance will, as the Minister said, link targets to air quality standards, and, when a local authority considers plans, there may be a sustainable argument for some road improvement in some areas to reduce pollution and improve air quality. That would be a question of balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to deal also with sustainable development. The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology recently referred to transport sustainability and the growth of carbon dioxide emissions, as was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge. The office indicated that if road traffic was to take its pro-rata share in reducing national emissions, vehicle mileage would have to reduce by 20 to 33 per cent. It is obviously important that local authorities should have some responsibility for drawing up plans to reduce road use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Minister for Transport in London, the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris), indicated that some compulsion might be required to encourage drivers to give up driving in the cities. I should like future legislation to go further than the Bill in considering the possibility of broadening the powers of local authorities to restrict traffic in their areas at times of high pollution. The Minister will know of the recent court case in the Greenwich area, which raised that very issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other area that I want briefly to touch upon, and to which other members of the Committee have referred, is the trend—which we now appear to be trying to reverse—towards out-of-town centres and car-based shopping. We should recognise that that is undesirable not only because of the resulting increase in road and vehicle usage but because of its detrimental effect on the quality of life for those people in our cities who do not have access to a car and who see their local shops, their pharmacy and their post office disappear. We must consider the impact on their quality of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly endorse the hon. Gentleman's point, but I suggest that once again there is a mechanical problem with the Bill. The organisation which must consider the developments that he mentions is in almost all counties the district council; it is the district council that is concerned with what happens to the high street. However, the Bill is aimed at the highways authority, which is the next tier up. That is why it is so important that we make clear who will be responsible for what, and how the public's views will be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin-Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a point that is not immediately relevant to the area that I represent, as we have a single-tier authority. When we establish the new strategic authority for London, we will need to work out who has what responsibilities. In an area such as Kent, it is important that both tiers have responsibility, because decisions taken by, say, Dartford council about the development in which it may be involved at Bluewater may have a profound effect upon traffic and other matters in other parts of Kent. So there is a need for the strategic county authority to have a key role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course no one would disagree with that, but the key question is: who will hold the public inquiry—if there is to be a public inquiry; that is not mentioned in the Bill—if there is a knock-on impact on a district?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin-Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, there is nothing in the Bill that would change the current system of planning inquiries. Some of us may have suggestions about how that might be improved, but the Bill would not change it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the fact that clause 2, which we are discussing, and which new clause 1 would delete, makes clear and specific references to statutory development plans for areas and a clear commitment to the encouragement of cycling and walking and the alteration of planning policies so as to reduce the need to travel, which precisely meet his point? Does he therefore agree that, before we sacrifice clause 2, we must be absolutely clear about the Minister's intention with regard to his powers under new clause 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin-Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will respond to my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to end by stressing the positive things that local authorities can do—such as suggesting safe routes to schools. For a variety of reasons, anyone who has travelled from the suburbs to central London today—whether they cycled or came by private or public transport—will have noticed that during the half-term period, at least half an hour can be knocked off the journey time, because there is no traffic taking children to school. The point made by my hon. Friend for Cambridge about not encouraging us in bad habits from an early age is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not go as far as I would want; nor do I think that it goes as far as its promoter would want,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
but it is an important step in the right direction. I hope that it will be passed with the new clause and reach the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Simpson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also congratulate the promoter of the Bill, the hon. Member for Bath—and the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North, who carried the torch at an earlier stage. I should also like to congratulate Friends of the Earth and perhaps mention in particular Ron Bailey, whom history should record as having been behind many of the best environmental ideas that we have ever had. I am a reluctant supporter of new clause 1. I say reluctant because my concerns are focused on the absence of targets. To make this discretionary at a local level and to make it absent at a national level is saddening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too would have preferred the Bill to have gone slightly further than it did, but the hon. Gentleman would be wrong to suggest that it will be discretionary on councils to draw up their local reports. The assurances that I have given already and those that the Minister will, I hope, shortly give, should disabuse him of that view. It is vital that those councils be required to produce their reports. If they do not intend to do so they will need extremely good reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for those comments and I hope that the hon. Member is right. The logic of the wording of the new clause simply defeats me. I know that local authorities will have to draw up a report. I do not understand the circumstances in which the report itself would be without targets. Perhaps it is just one of the limitations that I bring to the House, but I cannot envisage a situation in which a local authority would say, "The roads are gridlocked, half the children are stricken with asthma and we are losing £1 billion a year but, what the hell, let's call it progress."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To have such a report without an obligation to set targets on what is to be done about it suggests that we have squandered the great opportunities that the Bill should have offered us. It is saddening to see an amendment in which the Government have made a virtue of the absence of a plan. Many of us know of the increasing seriousness of the problem of road traffic congestion to both urban and rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drawing up plans with targets, we should be clear in our minds that they would not preclude the development of bypasses. They would be an integral part of a coherent plan for integrated trannsport management,. To present the Bill as an anti-bypass measure is a disservice to the work that has gone into it. If we had proper targets, we would be forced to recognise that a whole series of contradictory elements go into our current road transport and public safety policies in towns and cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a public meeting in my constituency just over a month ago, it became absolutely clear that a large part
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
of the congestion in peak-hour traffic resulted from parents taking their children to school. Asked why they did this, they replied that it was not safe for the children to go by bike. Objectively, that is true. A cyclist in Britain is 10 times more at risk of being involved in a road accident than a cyclist in Denmark. It is the absence of measures to shift the balance of safety as well as subsidy that makes the development of coherent local and national plans necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other measures could be taken that would complement such a shift. Nottingham is twinned with Karlsruhe. In Karlsruhe it is possible to get on a tram at 2 am and tell the tram driver that one would like a taxi to Bluebell Hill Road in St. Ann's. One would then see the tram driver speaking into the microphone back to the base, and by 2.17 am a taxi would be waiting to continue the second part of the journey. The purpose is not to exclude people with cars from access to all parts of the city but to plan to provide it. That is the basis of my reluctant support for the Bill: it is not because it allows us to do these things or because it requires the Secretary of State to implement it as a coherent plan, but because we shall be able to use it as the basis for the job that we have been set today. I hope that we can make that final step—the act of courage that the public wish us to make. The measures that will enable them to live sensible and healthy lives are not anti-car, bypass, bus or vehicle, but are about a proper balance to ensure that the supply and movement of goods to sustain people's lives is not carried out in ways that destroy their health or physical safety, which are the pre-conditions for a decent life. Despite a reluctance on account of the absence of targets and national obligation, I support the Bill in the hope that we can finish the job begun today early in the first Session of the next Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without pre-empting the role of the hon. Member for Bath, I will attempt to respond to a number of questions that were directed to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson), I do not believe that the clause represents a significant weakening of the obligations that we place on highway authorities. After all, a highway authority must, at such time as the Secretary of State directs, prepare
	<br><q><p>"a report containing an assessment of … traffic … and a forecast of the growth …."</p></q>
It must also specify targets for reducing traffic, or the rate of growth, except under subsection (5), where an authority might determine that it is not appropriate, in which case it must give its reasons. As I said earlier, it will not be sufficient for an authority to say that that is a load of rubbish and refuse to do it. In preparing its report, a highway authority is also required to have regard to the guidance that the Secretary of State will issue which will give a clear steer as to what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) asked me for an idea of what acceptable reasons might be. I have said that it might not be possible to set a reduction target if a major regeneration project is taking place. I am reluctant to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
go further in giving guidance on what might be acceptable because I do not wish to appear to suggest acceptable alibis for authorities which, for no good reason, may decide that a requirement is inappropriate. I do not wish to give them a menu of excuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's reasoning for not having a menu of excuses, but it would be completely appropriate for him to reveal a menu of inappropriate excuses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but not exhaustively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked how we would signify approval or disapproval of a report. The most persuasive power that I would have would be over funding decisions. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North asked how funding would relate to the plans. I shall attempt to make it clear in the guidance that I expect there to be a clear direct link between the bids for resources made through the TPP process and the authority's reasons for believing that that investment would help to achieve the targets. That is a fairly persuasive power. If I felt that an authority were dismissing the requirements in a cavalier way, it would not receive funding for its projects. Those who made a case for investment that was well reasoned, well thought out and closely related to their targets would be rewarded. In the current TPP process this year, the only package bid that received additional resources was the West Midlands—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Eltham is completely out of order in having a conversation with the hon. Member for Bath while the Minister is speaking. Will the hon. Gentleman please return to his seat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The West Midlands package was the only one to receive additional funding to support the development of its bus showcase routes because it is an excellent project. When making bids year by year, West Midlands always states what would be achieved if the policy could be developed further. That is not lost on other authorities which compare the treatment of one authority with another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have no difficulty in including in the guidance the list of measures originally specified in the Bill. Many of them are already in the guidance on best practice issued to local authorities. We encourage them to include the right elements in their package bids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley was worried about the consequences of the measure, which he believed could be the end of road improvement. First, I assure him that the Bingley relief road is not under threat from the Bill or anything else. The road is an important element of the Bradford-Cumbria DVFO—design, build, finance and operate—project for which tenders are invited. The Bill will not impinge on the project in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I do not agree with my hon. Friend that providing a bypass for a village or a small town would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
conflict with the objective of reducing traffic in the absolute or of reducing traffic growth. Clearly, we do not want to build either trunk or local roads that would so generate traffic that the benefits of such roads would be wiped out. That is why my Department, which is responsible for trunk road proposals, and local authorities, which are responsible for local roads proposals, are required to apply the traffic generation modelling techniques developed for us by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment—SACTRA—our advisory body. A proposed road that showed that it would so generate traffic that it wiped out any benefits would not qualify for funding because it would not have the appropriate benefit-to-cost ratio.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of SACTRA's further review of the effect on roads of economic development, can the Minister assure the Committee that the anxieties that we have expressed in the debate will be taken into account in the SACTRA's report's terms of reference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: SACTRA already has a brief to consider the relationship between traffic and economic development from both angles. We would not change our current policy on traffic reduction simply on the basis of yet another report. Transport policy must be a coherent whole; the great transport debate, which led to a range of regional seminars and a Green Paper, set that framework and the Bill fits neatly within it. The Green Paper acknowledged the potential of local targets and there are some national targets—on cycling networks, for example, which are to double by 2002 and double again by 2012. I do not rule out the adoption of more national targets at a later stage but I want targets to work effectively and to deliver what they want to achieve locally before I am persuaded that we should apply them nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley, if we build a bypass to relieve a village or a town, it is equally important to take steps to calm the traffic on the existing route so that the benefit is delivered. There is no point in bypassing a village and removing traffic if that makes it even more convenient for other traffic to speed through it. If all that is done effectively, no new traffic is generated on the bypass; existing traffic is merely shifted from an environmentally unfriendly route through a village, which destroys the quality of life there, to a purpose-built road, which is much better for traffic and those who have been bypassed. So that represents no conflict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North asked about the consultation process and, in particular, what we had in mind under the category of "others". We have included that category so that we do not prescribe or limit the range of bodies and individuals who can be consulted. I would be very surprised if organisations such as Transport 2000 and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
Friends of the Earth were not involved automatically. I am happy to meet their natioal representatives, as is the Secretary of State, because that dialogue is valuable. I am sure that they will have a vital input locally. Any plan that is not based on the widest possible consultation and broad local consensus is unlikely to be implemented successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, I would expect TPP bids—of course, I am referring to the English system—to be related directly to the achievement of the targets that local highways authorities set themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Woolwich asked about additional measures. In a separate exercise, we are already consulting local authorities on what additional powers they would find helpful in managing traffic in their areas, especially in urban areas. If they were to convince us that other powers should be granted, that would be a matter for further legislation. Whether those powers were applied to a particular town or city would be a matter for local consultation and decision making. Of course, local authorities are already empowered to produce air quality plans, which can involve closing roads to traffic if pollution is excessive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury was concerned about the interaction between planning authorities and highway authorities. However, probably in every case, the highway authority and the strategic planning authority will be the same body. That will certainly be so in shire counties. Of course, unitary authorities are responsible for both functions. It is important that strategic development plans do not contradict what is decided in terms of traffic management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the role of district or borough councils, which represent a second tier, any local plans that they make must be in consonance with structure plans. As I understand planning law, there is a procedure by which local plans can be called in if they contradict structure plans so that public inquiries take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not attracted to the idea of presenting local traffic plans to the formal process of public inquiry. I want there to be wide consultation, but many of the objectives of the vast majority of members of the Committee would not be achieved if yet another element of planning was subjected to a lengthy public inquiry process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point and I am grateful for his clarification of the matter. However, there is an anomaly. In the case of a two-tier authority, the structure plan produced by the county authority is subject to a local inquiry. Does that mean that a highways authority could produce a separate traffic plan that is not incorporated with the structure plan, but which, in certain areas, disagreed with the plan that was the subject of public inquiry, and that there would be no further inquiry? Surely we need to tie the two together and not make them subject to two separate inquiries, but to one inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have explained, the authority would be the same for both purposes. Theoretically, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
is possible for a local authority to be so badly managed that its transport committee goes off on one tack, while the planners go in another direction and, although the body comprises the same councillors, none the less it approves those contradictory policies. I hope that local government is slightly better managed and co-ordinated than that, but if that were to happen, local people would know where the fault lay and they could remedy it at the next local government election. To introduce yet another round of planning inquiries would not assist either in the achievement of the objectives of the Bill or in any other way. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury made an important point and I hope that local authorities will read in 	<i>Hansard</i> his wise admonitions to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with the points that were put specifically to me, in which case I shall resume my seat and allow the hon. Member for Bath to address the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the themes of the discussions on the new clause has been the tribute that so many members of the Committee have rightly paid to the many organisations and individuals who have played such an important part in getting the Bill to this stage. It is absolutely right that specific mention was made of Ron Bailey of Friends of the Earth for his work. I, too, pay tribute to him, as I have done in private on many occasions, and to his organisation. I also pay tribute to the Green party and Plaid Cymru, which worked so hard to produce the original version of the Bill, which was piloted so successfully in its early stages by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North to whom I also pay tribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other theme of the debate is the great desire by the majority of members of the Committee to get the Bill through its next stages as quickly as possible. So that we can complete our business before 1 o'clock, I hope that members of the Committee will understand if I do not pick up on all the points that they have raised. I agreed with the remarks of the hon. Member for Eltham about the need to improve schools, so that children can attend their local schools. That is an argument for having excellence for all and high quality schools throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the hon. Gentleman's views on motorway tolls although, sadly, they are not specifically relevant to the Bill. After all, if we want people to leave urban conurbations, it seems silly to put constraints on roads on which we want them to travel, although we want them to use them less often and travel shorter distances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eltham referred also to the importance of sharing examples of good practice. That reminded me of the recent publicity about some planning policies in Camden, for example, that mirror those in Edinburgh. Discussions are now taking place about the possibility of allowing housing development only if the people living in the houses agree to forgo the ownership of cars. Such an idea is imaginative; no doubt it will be controversial and it may not necessarily be accepted by all. Nevertheless, it is important that such examples are aired. The measures
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
that will be contained in the guidance notes and those in the Bill will ensure that all councils are considering such ideas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister has given the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central the assurances that he sought. The most crucial point appears in subsection (3) of the new clause. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The report must also contain any other information or proposals which—
	<ol>
	<li>relate to levels of local road traffic in the area, and</li>
	<li>are required by guidance under subsection (6)."</li></ol></p></q>
It is critical that the importance of guidance appears in the Bill. It must be taken into account when a report is drawn up, and the Minister has given us assurances on what will be contained in the guidance. In response to hon. Members' concerns, he said that reference will be made to planning policies and the need to encourage cycling and walking. If the Bill is to have teeth, there must also be a clear link between the reports and funding issues. The Minister has responded to members of the Committee by giving us tha assurance, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Keighley is aware that everyone who has spoken has made it clear that this Bill is not an anti-bypass Bill any more than it is an anti-car Bill. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that in some circumstances the building of a bypass benefits local communities and should go ahead. He may not be aware that I became extremely unpopular by supporting the building of a bypass in my area. Some of the organisations sponsoring the Bill were not happy with my support for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North was right in many of his comments, and especially when he stressed the need for road traffic reduction in rural areas. The Bill does not deal with urban areas only, and the hon. Gentleman was right to say that the production of plans should be a rule with very few exceptions. Wherever possible the plan should be for traffic reduction rather than the other option, which is minimising the increase of traffic growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North that the plans should consider the environmental impact, but I slightly disagree with the hon. Member for Keighley who said that their only concern should be the reduction of congestion. Of course, congestion needs to be reduced. It costs £19 billion a year and it is vital that we do something about it. However, the plans should also consider environmental issues such as air quality and the impact on health and buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge described her own experience in detail. What an example she is to many of us. I cannot confess to being as good as the hon. Lady, and I congratulate her on what she has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister has reassured the hon. Member for Canterbury on the issue of responsibility. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North rightly drew attention to the starting date, and I hope that she
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
has been given clear assurances by the Minister. From my discussions on the issue, I have seen the difficulties that Departments face because of the different mechanisms operating in Wales and Scotland. However, the Minister has made the starting date for England clear, and I hope that the other Departments will soon tell us what they are able to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Woolwich raised the critical issue of sustainability. I know that many members of the Committee are increasingly interested in that and in sustainable economics, which are not covered by the Bill. All political parties take an interest in those issues. The hon. Gentleman also asked about additional powers for local authorities, and the Minister touched on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, South did not go into detail about the one example he could have cited, which is the successful partnership between his local council and the major employer in the area, Boots. They have an effective working relationship. As I said to the hon. Member for Canterbury, it underlines the importance of consultation not just with other councils, but with businesses and other organisations including, as the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North pointed out, environmental organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the new clause is a major step forward. It puts road traffic reduction firmly on the map and on the political agenda in a way that is certainly not anti-car, but which is designed to reduce congestion and pollution and to improve the quality of life for people in this country. I hope that it will be supported by the Committee and that we shall then be able to make rapid progress on the remaining issues for consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

for Northern Ireland, as I think that would be a suitable subject for discussion with the 26 local authorities in Northern Ireland, although obviously the power remains with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to the long title should perhaps be regarded as the Neville Rees memorial long title, and I hope that someone will pass on to his widow, Elizabeth, the fact that he is still remembered. He was the civil servant who, in 1986, took the then assistant Minister for roads to see representatives from Friends of the Earth, led the Minister on a bicycling tour of the Netherlands, and promoted the idea that, in Cambridge, there should be a bicycle bridge across the railway tracks to take cyclicts away from Mill road and Hills road in order to increase safety and promote cycling. He reflected the fact that there are 100 civil servants in the Department of Transport who have bicycle parking places, so the idea that people in the Department of Transport spend all their time trying to build roads through sensitive areas is flatly contradicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may say so to the hon. Member for Cambridge—in case the 	<i>Cambridge Evening News</i> reads her speech about conversion—before I came to the House, I ran a signs business putting neon lights outside theatres and cinemas in the west end. We took our goods around in hand carts and had no internal combustion engines most of the time. Even when we went to Selfridges to clear up after an IRA bomb in 1973, most of us took the underground as the most effective way to cross London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Casualty reduction is not a matter to which people need to be converted and the Bill will raise safety levels and reduce risks for vulnerable road users. Pedestrians and two wheelers will gain most. If local authority plans to help people in cars to move out of them by choice, those people gain as do those who remain on the road. In effect, this is a Benthamite Bill from which everyone should gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end with a warning. The real reasons for the increase in traffic flows have been prosperity, democracy—many pensioners, young people, ethnic minorities and poor people have access to cars—and fashion. Perhaps we should work more on the fashion element.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Minister with responsibility for the environment in the Northern Ireland Office. He tells me that the Northern Ireland Office would support the principle of setting targets for road traffic reduction. Should the Bill be enacted, the Northern Ireland Office will follow suit as a policy matter. It will, of course, be for the Northern Ireland Office to determine the appropriate mechanism to do that, but in policy terms, we are at one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. On behalf of the Committee, I thank you for your firm chairmanship and take the opportunity to thank all Committee members, especially those who did me the great honour of agreeing to be sponsors of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I associate myself entirely with the hon. Gentleman's remarks and place on record our appreciation of the efforts of the officials and draftsmen. It is often said that the wheels of Government move remarkably slowly, but the officials and draftsmen have had about a week and a half to work with the advisers to the hon. Member for Bath to produce the amendments which the Committee accepted today. Those amendments will produce a workable Bill which I feel confident can find its way on to the statute book. That is a remarkable achievement and shows what can be done with good will and co-operation, which have typified the work on the Bill since Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I echo those comments and thank everybody who has played such a constructive part in the Bill. Notwithstanding the occupation of our Front Bench, we welcome the legislation. As so many people care about traffic reduction, we can look forward with hope to the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your kind remarks. My pleasant duty is to release you all to your lunch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Committee rose at six minutes to One o'clock.</i></p>
