	<p>[SIR MICHAEL SHERSBY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Horserace Totalisator Board Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>NEW CORPORATE POWERS FOR THE HORSERACE TOTALISATOR BOARD</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury St. Edmunds)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The context in which the Bill should be placed relates to events of the past few days. Today is a significant day for the future of racing and betting because the midweek lottery draw is being introduced. That will certainly have an impact on the betting industry and the racing industry overall. Today, we also have the announcement that the Tote has come to an informal agreement with Ladbroke's for Tote Direct. That will enhance the viability of the Tote and, hopefully, its profitability, through which prize money will flow into the racing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty for the Tote is that thus far, it has been inhibited in what it can do. The viability of the Tote has been questioned and discussed at great length. The Bill is important because it further progresses the deregulation of the betting industry and because at its heart is one particular theme—the ability to bet on non-sporting events. It is appropriate for the Tote to be able to offer that and for punters to be able to bet on a variety of events, not least, I hope—if the Bill completes all its stages—the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Bill, which is important for the evolution of the Tote and its viability and profitability, and which will have an impact on the racing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Corby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by declaring a number of interests. The first is a lifelong devotion to and, some would say, obsession with the turf. Any legislation that is designed to enhance the attractiveness of our greatest sport is bound to draw my warm support. Secondly—I was about to say almost before the start of time, but certainly a long time ago—I advised bookmakers on a number of matters. It is some years since I did so, and I do not speak from any special interest this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, although I have a lifelong devotion to the turf, I have virtually no interest in its gambling aspects. I have never placed a bet with the turf, although my wife reminded me this morning that a long time ago, I settled a small debt that she has incurred with Tote
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
bookmakers. Even longer ago, when I practised as a barrister, people consulted me on matters such as those before the Committee, although I confess that I am more rusty about such matters than I would wish and certainly more so than my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), who is diligently in his place this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All my life I have read about and argued with those who want to ensure that the Tote has an even bigger place in the affairs of horse-racing than is currently the case; I refer to the question of a Tote monopoly. I have always been opposed to that idea, but one of the corollaries for those of us who are determinedly opposed to a Tote monopoly is that we must recognise that the existing law has imposed restrictions on the turf which simply have no relevance to modern-day circumstances. This vital Bill and the important clause which we are discussing are designed to ensure that just one of the restrictions that fetter the Tote in any competition with bookmakers is to be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when we put our discussion in the context of deregulation—of fair competition—all members of the Committee and, indeed, of the House, will recognise that aspects of our gambling laws, if I may put it in a generic sense, are completely out of date and inappropriate. It is a pity that we proceed by small measures, each of which is designed to eliminate this particular hurdle or that particular problem, and that we do not take a more comprehensive look at betting and gaming legislation and the accompanying measures that are relevant to the regulation of gambling. The Bill should be seen as a necessary, but not the only step which must be taken to ensure that Tote bookmakers are able to compete more fairly and more satisfactorily than is the case because of existing restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Spring), who is lucky enough to have Newmarket, the centre of the world, in his constituency, is absolutely right to say that this is a significant time in the history of the turf. Those of us who read serious newspapers, such as myself and my hon. Friends the Members for Wolverhampton, South-West and for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), who is also well up on the news—I stress the word "news", because few journals should put themselves forward as offering news to the public—were charmed to see this morning a smiling photograph of Lord Wyatt on the front page. He has pulled of a most significant coup on behalf of the organisation that he has graced as chairman for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Wyatt is still, of course, a young man, Sir Michael. He is, I think, the only significant survivor at the top levels of quangos and other organisations who was appointed by the previous Labour Government. That was before many members of the Committee were born. There is no particular reason why people should be discriminated against as severely as they are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
at present because of their age. Most of us welcomed the re-election to the United States Senate a few months ago of Senator Strom Thurmond at the age of 93, and hope that he will live to be 100 and become the first member of that august body to be a centurion, or should that be a centenarian?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is widely believed that my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) is a man of great but indeterminate age. There is no reason why gentlemen with experience of the world, such as Lord Wyatt—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order: We are getting rather far from the provisions of the clause. The hon. Gentleman should direct his remarks to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that some members of the Committee are becoming a little impatient, so I shall say that I expect the Bill to be another but, I hope, not the last significant achievement of Lord Wyatt in his distinguished chairmanship of the Horserace Totalisator Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have added a few persuasive words to those of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds, and that the Committee will accept that the clause is entirely appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Sir Michael, what a pleasure it is to have you in the Chair for the Committee's proceedings on an important Bill for the racing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to delay the Committee, but I must thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds for sponsoring the Bill in the House of Commons and congratulate Lord Kimball and Lord Wyatt on their success in piloting it through another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put on record during the clause stand part debate why the Bill is so important. The Tote is losing a substantial market share to other betting shops on non-sport bets, which are currently not permitted under its rules of engagement. That has cost racing approximately £1.5 million in profits that the Tote would have put into it had the Bill existed a year or so ago. We need to make all speed in putting the Bill on the statute book to allow the Tote to compete freely and fairly with the rest of the bookmaking industry, and particularly betting shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that the Committee's proceedings are taking place on the day of the national lottery's first mid-week draw. When the Bill was introduced in another place, it would have allowed people to bet on the outcome of the United Kingdom national lottery, as well as the lottery in Ireland. I expect that hon. Members will want to explore that matter further on Report on Friday—assuming that the Committee satisfactorily concludes its deliberations this morning. It would be better to discuss such matters on the Floor of the House rather than in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I end with two invitations. The first is to you, Sir Michael. As you have had the grace to chair our proceedings and show an interest in this important Bill, you would be most welcome to join members of the all-party racing and bloodstock committee on their annual visit to a race course. The second invitation is to colleagues to turn out in force on Report on Friday, when it would be more appropriate to have a lengthier discussion of the issues that the Bill raises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Budgen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to say a few words about an important issue in your company, Sir Michael. I start by declaring an interest in racing, although not in betting. I trained and rode horses from the age of 18 until my mid-40s. I still know many people in the racing world and am well aware of most of their hopes and, if I may say so, their prejudices—they are, of course, as much of the victims of prejudice as the rest of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare another interest because I was—in the past, at any rate—an occasional correspondent in 	<i>The Racing Post.</i> I say that with some diffidence because although I wrote three articles for it over Christmas, it may never engage my services again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to refer to that interest. I should, however, tell him that there is a groundswell of opinion among those who wish to continue to read his thoughts in The Racing Post. Its editor may come under pressure to find space so that my hon. Friend can continue to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. A long time ago, when I first went into the courts as a young man, I heard the oil and grease that lawyers poured on each other. I had thought that such oil and grease could never cascade on people to quite the same extent as when one silky lawyer addresses another. Having entered the House of Commons, I now find that the oil and grease are not only of higher quality but exist in much greater profusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that, in talking of silk and of oil and grease, he may be mixing metaphors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be. However, the silk covers the body and the oil and grease come out from the mouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have heard the hon. Gentleman's declaration of interest and I am sure that it has been recorded in 	<i>Hansard.</i> Can we now proceed with clause 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can. I want to make one serious point. As I have argued elsewhere, people with a serious interest in racing want to assist the Tote by opening up areas where it is prevented from engaging in proper trade. There is a view in the racing world that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
it is politically possible to have a Tote monopoly and that so long as they keep kicking at the door, a Government will eventually produce the legislation for a Tote monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are formidable problems in racing: all rich men have formidable problems, but it does not follow that, because of that, they should be assisted by the Government or taxpayer. Many people in the racing world who are of great intellectual distinction and who have often had considerable success in business argue that there should be a Tote monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make an important point and, if people disagree with it, they can express their disagreement. There would be no majority in this House—or any that we might anticipate in future—for a Tote monopoly. To have a Tote monopoly would be to deprive the British people of an element of excitement and glamour provided by the bookmakers. It would also deprive them of the competitive advantage of having a market that is provided by the Tote and the bookmakers. Even if those arguments were disregarded by the legislature, attempting to impose a Tote monopoly would give rise to amazing and formidable problems of enforcement. That would result in a system of private and illegal bookmaking, which would be most serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that people of great importance, intellectual acumen and success in business who have come into racing quite recently believe that their problems would be cured by a Tote monopoly—but they should think of other ways of curing their problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds on introducing the Bill. I follow the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West in acknowledging that the hon. Gentleman's expertise is widely known in the House and elsewhere. So ecumenial is his interest in racing that I recall him attending the red rose meeting at Brighton on the occasion of the 1995 Labour party conference. If I remember correctly, he was covering the meeting for 	<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with the argument for a Tote monopoly. A case can be made for making pool betting available, through one medium or another, as a product for the public. The jury is still out as to the best way of extending such a product. We need to debate it more fully. It would be premature to arrive at a clear conclusion now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My declaration of interests is rather slender. I am afraid that I am at the low-class end of the market in that I restrict my activities to a Yankee bet on a Saturday, when time permits, usually on the basis that I can watch my choices lose on the television. A greater claim to having an interest in this matter is that the boundary commissioner—in his wisdom or
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
otherwise—has moved my constituency boundaries to include Aintree race course. I look forward to seeing many more meetings at Aintree in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a sensible measure. We are moving forward with deregulation in various forms of gambling slowly and cautiously, which is the proper way forward. There are changes in people's gambling habits, changes in sporting activities and changes in the link between gambling them and gambling, not to mention that advent of the national lottery. It is sensible to make changes and sensible, as far as possible, to create a level playing field between the national lottery and other forms of gambling. I accept that that is not an easy concept to deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is agreement between the Government and the Opposition that on an incremental basis, we shall try to make effective changes, as appropriate, as we go along. We have gone along with that agreement so far, and this is a sensible measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Powell) said—and I am sure that he will correct me if I misquote him—that any event that enhances our great national sport is to be welcomed. I think that "any event" is a phrase rather to ambitious in its sweep. Certainly, this measure is to be welcomed, and we have no intention of delaying its progress today. If it were to reach its Report stage on Friday, we would hope to give the remaining stages a fair wind and see it on the statute book with some speed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interest in this matter is that I am the Minister with responsibility for horse racing and gambling in the United Kingdom. I am very proud of that role. I am also proud of the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds has brought this measure to the Committee stage in this place. It is an important measure, which is in line with the Government's attitude towards deregulation of the gambling and betting industry where it is appropriate and where it is for the protection of the public—or where the protection of the public is taken into account.

We are also concerned that an organisation as eminent as the Tote should be able to operate profitably and successfully for the benefit of the racing industry and horse racing generally. This measure—particularly this clause which sets out the basis of the measure—is especially welcome. It will help the Tote to compete on an equal basis with other bookmakers in the fixed odds market.

My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East referred to a possible Tote monopoly. I do not see that ever being a prospect. My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale mentioned reading The Sporting Life. I read 	<i>The Racing</i> Post myself—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is all the same at the end of the day. The decision by Ladbroke's to have Tote direct terminals—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that it is all the same at the end of the day. That is slightly inaccurate, it is in fact all the same by the end of the next day. If exclusive news is reported in one of the periodicals one day, it appears in the other the next day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not get into a discussion of the merits of various periodicals, except to say that I hope that the proceedings of this Committee are well reported in both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is out of order to read periodicals in this Committee, whether or not they are to do with racing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I hope that our proceedings are well reported in both those periodicals tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend sits down, may I bring him back to the Bill and the question of the Tote? If, as a result of the Bill, the Tote increases its income, what effect does my hon. Friend think that that would have on the Tote chairman's salary? If so, should he not do it sooner rather than later</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer the matter to my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary, with whom I discuss such things from time to time. However, I certainly hope that future Governments will never dream of fixing the salaries of such important and influential people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will have seen the remarks of the shadow Chancellor as reported this morning—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the Committee to direct its remarks to clause 1. The matters just raised are not within the purview of that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Michael. What I said seems to have whipped up a hornets' nest, so I shall go no further.

The Tote is a successful operation, but it needs a little help. I do not really deal with level playing fields in my deregulatory role: that is not the point. We should help businesses to develop as they want to develop, which is why the Tote should be able to proceed along the lines proposed in the Bill. It is perfectly reasonable that the Tote should occupy the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
same position as that occupied by other bookmakers. There is no likelihood of a monopoly being created, and it is clear that the Bill will be good for the industry.

Before I was interrupted, I was talking about Tote Direct terminals in Ladbrokes shops. Those allow punters to get involved in pool betting, which is sensible. The Tote is a positive element in racing, and the Government want it to be encouraged in any way that is appropriate. The Bill provides the opportunity for that encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill gets a fair wind behind it when it comes before the House again after today's Committee stage, and that it becomes law as soon as possible. As the Minister involved, I shall continue to offer it all the support that I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Meale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mansfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the measure, for which the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and I campaigned as members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. The Bill is a small step along the path that must be travelled on behalf of the British racing and betting public. Moreover, the public—and the public purse—must be protected. Technology moves so rapidly that, unless there is major deregulation in the next few years, we will find it impossible to police the betting industry.

I hope that the Minister will take away the best wishes of the Committee and the message that a lot more needs to be done for racing and for the general public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to say a few words, but must first declare my interest as treasurer of the all-party racing group.

I welcome the Bill, but we heard this morning that the national lottery is to have even more games and will thus take an even bigger share of gambling in this country. The lottery started out as a way to have a little harmless fun but now it is becoming a dinosaur. We must look after our racing industry. I hope that the Minister will recognise the need for a level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
