	<div class='title'>—(EXTENSION OF DEFINITION OF "DISPLACED PUPILS" FOR PURPOSES OF S. 104 OF PRINCIPAL ACT.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Amendment proposed (	<i>27th January</i>), in page 1, line 16, after the word "school, to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or a school other than a school for which the accounts for buildings had not been closed on or before the fourteenth day of November, nineteen hundred and fifty-two."—[	<i>Mr. Mellish.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Question again proposed, " That those words be there inserted."</p>
	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie Hale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unfortunate that we on this side of the Committee sit with our backs to the clock, and are not always aware of the time, with the result that at Tuesday's meeting of the Committee I was cut short by the clock when I was dealing with some of the various explanations of this somewhat complicated Clause; but this fact enables me now to call attention to two important matters which should be reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Linstead) told us how his mind worked in his fascinating and beneficial experience, and he said that there was no question about this proposition. It appears that a completed school is a school either with a roof on or a mortgage on it, and the hon. Member for Putney says that in between there is a long and complicated process to which the Minister might well apply her mind, with the result that we should get some indication of what she thought in due course. At this stage, the right hon. Lady made a statement amplifying those she made earlier. Then the hon. Member for Putney forthwith expressed the rapturous and delighted surprise of a boy who had unexpectedly received a large Easter egg on Whit-Monday and said that this was more than he had hoped for, and that it was really good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real difficulty about that compliment is that it was paid to a Minister who had made three explanations of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1238</span>
Clause, following four separate explanations made in December by the Parliamentary Secretary, and it is reasonable to suppose that the hon. Member for Putney had read them all. It is obvious that if, having read the seven separate explanations which had been made by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister, the hon. Member for Putney was still in a slight difficulty, we also are entitled to say that we are in some difficulty ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I propose to say about the strange and sinister conduct of the right hon. Lady concerns the statement from the document to which I made reference —the document of 12th February, 1952. The statement was this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new definition would not be retrospective in the sense that grant on completed projects could be reassessed: grant claims on schemes in progress or for which accounts had not been closed would be eligible for review in the light of the new definition."</p></blockquote>
The curious thing about that statement, and the important thing about it, is that it is clear, unequivocal and that there should be no dubiety about its meaning. No one could argue that it could mean anything other than what it says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After we had received seven or eight explanations, the right hon. Lady, in a speech in which I interrupted her, called attention to this statement, and said she was coming to it in a moment, but she never did. It is sometimes said that it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive, but I do not think that that occasion was one when that proposition was satisfactorily made. She never did arrive,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1239</span>
and we never did arrive, and, after three hours of discussion already, we are still trying to find out what this Clause means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the right hon. Lady tell us this? Was that an accurate statement of the undertakings and promises made to the representatives of Catholic parents, on the basis of which a settlement was arrived at? If so, is she going to tell us, or is she going to say it was a mistake, or suggest that it was some clerical error, using the word "clerical" in the secretarial sense?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question that I want to ask the right hon. Lady is whether this proposition was ever put up to the denominations. I have made what inquiries I can and have received such information as I can get, and I should like to know whether it was ever said to the other denominations that the effective date would be the date of the Royal Assent. Was it ever said, or was this really an unhappy substitute forced on the right hon. Lady by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to save money now and put the expenditure on the next Budget—which may be his last?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say this with great seriousness. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, East (Mr. M. Stewart) called attention to the fact that this post-dating of the cheques promised to the denominational schools will raise an obvious dilemma. Quite obviously, if by finishing a school on 20th June, they do not qualify for the grant, while on 1st July they would, and they know what the date is, or can ascertain it, as my hon. Friend suggested, there may be a reason for suspecting what will happen. It is obvious to a child of 10. But the right hon. Lady got up, with the air of an elderly school mistress who had found a bright pupil in the headmaster's garden, and said that my hon. Friend had made a serious suggestion which would force her to reconsider the whole matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May be, it did not occur to the right hon. Lady; may be, a little device is necessary, and nobody could accuse the Parliamentary Secretary of having a mind free from device. We remember him with pleasure in the last Parliament, when he was never a man to be regarded as innocent of the possibilities of mental ingenuity in thinking of ways of avoiding
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
little difficulties, and so on. Is it really being suggested that no one in the Ministry of Education had realised that, if we put in a date in advance instead of the date we are suggesting, it is not an incentive to complete a school? The thing is absurd; it would occur to every child of 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish), who put down the Amendment, has been eminently reasonable about it, and so have we. It would have been eminently fair to say that the effective date should be 12th February, 1952, when the promise was made. It would be by no means unreasonable to say that the date should be 1st July, 1951, when the original agreement was made. We could put up a reasonable case, but we have not wanted to put the Committee in the position of having to divide on this matter, and the date that was put down was the date of the First Reading of the Bill. After all, that is a normal method of dealing with a matter of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a perfectly reasonable proposition, in answer to which the right hon. Lady has not yet put forward any argument. Indeed, all her speeches—apart from the explanatory portions, which no one seems to understand—all the argumentative portions of her speeches are directed to the fact that a hard and fast agreement was made on some occasion with somebody, and that a document which we have never seen was sent out. We are entitled to ask her whether the suggestion that the grants should date from the Royal Assent was ever included in this document. I suggest that it never was. I suggest that it has never been mentioned, and, indeed, that this definition of a proposed school has never appeared as a definition in any of the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, we find ourselves in this difficulty—that not merely the hon. Member for Putney cannot understand it, but that I do not understand it myself. We are entitled to know what it means before we leave this Clause, and to ask the right hon. Lady to give us an assurance that she will look at the matter again. I should have thought that she could bring about a considerable amount of reconciliation in, the Committee, when we are discussing what is a most important Clause, if she would say she would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
reconsider the matter. There are so very few denominational schools in course of erection at this time that it cannot be a matter on which any harm will be done to anybody. I hope the right hon. Lady will look at the matter again and give us an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Education (Miss Florence Horsbrugh)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Hale) has asked me to say if I have looked at this matter again and if I can give any explanation. I have certainly looked at the matter again, and I will do my best to give as clear an explanation as is possible. The hon. Gentleman said that he does not understand the Bill, but, when he said that he had not seen the term "proposed school," perhaps he had not read Section 104 of the 1944 Act, which we are now amending, or other parts of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the close of the meeting on Tuesday that I would certainly look at this matter again and consider it with sympathy, and I have done so. We always find that it is the border-line cases that are extremely difficult to deal with, and sometimes it seems that the difficulties of the border-line cases are more realised than the benefits being received by the others. I have to deal with borderline cases in many parts of the work of my Department, and they are always difficult. My sympathy is entirely with the border-line cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be easiest if I tried to give a short explanation of some of the points on which the hon. Gentleman said he still was not clear. I would ask hon. Members to remember that Clause 1 of this Bill is an Amendment of Section 104 of the 1944 Act and must be read with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When legislation was contemplated, we wrote to the various interested parties inviting them to come to the Ministry and discuss with us the various matters set out in a memorandum which we had prepared for the purpose. That memorandum, the title of which was
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following notes indicate briefly the nature of the legislative changes which the Government have in mind,"</p></blockquote>
went to all the interested parties, and we asked them to come and discuss those points. As it happened, the Roman Catholics were the first body to be seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1242</span>
The memorandum contained these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Much concern has been expressed over the very restricted definition of displaced pupils in Section 104, (2)(	<i>a</i>) of the Education Act, 1944. It is therefore proposed to amend the definition of ' displaced pupil '."</p></blockquote>
Those words were contained in the memorandum from which an excerpt was produced in the Committee and quotations made. I stated that there would be, and could be, no retrospection, and I stated that to all the other denominations and interested parties I met. Having discussed what would be the form of the legislation, we were then asked if the effect of there being no retrospection meant that no school which had begun to be built could receive the benefit of the definition of "displaced pupil."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I replied that I was anxious to help those border-line cases, as I have always been, and we had a discussion round the table as to how it could be done. The excerpt from the minute which was read is perfectly correct. We suggested that grant claims on schemes in progress for which account had not been closed would be eligible for review in the light of the new definition. That was during the discussion of how, if the Bill did become law, it would be administered regarding the arranging of the grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I am clear up to now. I would emphasise that this talk, which was one of several I had with interested parties, was of an exploratory nature. I would also emphasise that there was never any question of an intention to incorporate such words as I have mentioned in the legislation. It was always agreed that we were discussing how this could be administered when the Bill became an Act. The question was simply how, when the new definition "displaced pupil" had been agreed upon, it would be administered, and about there being no retrospection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill was published, it was made clear in Clause 1 that there was no interference with the general conditions of Section 104, but that it was confined to amending the definition of "displaced pupil." We considered very carefully before Second Reading what conditions would have to be fulfilled in order to enable a school to take advantage of the new definition, and we came to the conclusion that the only test
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1243</span>
compatible with the Act was whether or no the school had been " established and maintained " at the time of the passing of the Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That goes further than schemes in progress, but does not take in "accounts not being closed." I want to say quite frankly to hon. Members that not until this was looked into just before Second Reading was it found that the Amendment we were suggesting would not include schools defined as those whose accounts had not been closed. I am quite prepared to admit that it was a great pity that neither we nor those with whom we were having discussions nor their legal advisers had seen this point before. I admit that absolutely freely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Second Reading speech, as all hon. Members know, the Parliamentary Secretary made it perfectly plain that the school must be established and maintained. We received no protest either inside or outside the House about those words at that moment, and, furthermore, one of the officers of my Department saw a member of the hierarchy on 17th December and explained the situation fully to him. I have again read the minute. There were no protests then and there have been no protests since, although there have been letters and conversations on many points in the Bill. In fact, the last letter I received was dated 8th January. It referred to several points in the original memorandum and asked for one explanation on one part of Clause 1. but not on the special point that has been raised here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it perfectly clear that I was naturally somewhat surprised at some of the suggestions made in speeches at the meeting of the Committee, but I want to be absolutely fair to those of the Roman Catholic Church with whom I have been having discussions. They have never accused me of lack of faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the past; I think I had better get to the end of this. I now turn to the question of whether anything can be done to meet the intention of this Amendment. I would emphasise at the outset that the declared intention of this legislation has been to amend the definition of "displaced pupil" in Section 104 (2, 	<i>a</i>)—that and no more. The whole Section is governed by the condition that the school must be at the stage of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1244</span>
proposed school. I do not think I need now go into the position where the proposed school becomes a school. I think I have dealt with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Amendment designed to include schools which have passed this stage would involve an Amendment of these words throughout the Section. The question would also be raised whether Amendments would be necessary to other Sections of the 1944 Act, such as Section 13, which traces the stages through which a proposed school is finally established and maintained by a local education authority. There is no doubt in my mind that any Amendments of this scope and character would travel considerably beyond the intentions which I set out in my original memorandum circulated to the interested bodies, and that it would not be right to go back on these declared intentions which formed the basis of all my discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already told the Committee, I shall be prepared to administer the new definition with as much sympathy as is possible within the limits of Section 104. I have had the facts concerning the schools which might, perhaps, be called border-line cases, looked into. The number of such schools is not more than five. However, I must not be taken as giving any pledge—I am being very cautious—but it is certainly not necessary to assume that all five schools fall outside the benefits of Clause 1 of this Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The date of the establishment of the school must necessarily be settled in relation to a variety of circumstances in each particular case. When the Bill becomes law, applications for grants made under the new definition of "displaced pupils" will all be examined on their merits, carefully and sympathetically, within the provisions of the law as laid down in Section 104.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As amended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as amended. I have tried as far as I can to make the position clear, and I would suggest to hon. Members that as we are all anxious to get this Bill on to the Statute Book as quickly as possible, we might now come to a decision, especially as we really all agree on what we want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have described as carefully as I can all the work I have done and all my intentions. There was never any intention
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
of putting words such as these into the Bill. That is absolutely clear. In the time between the last meeting of this Committee and this morning I have looked through all the minutes and memoranda. I am sympathetic regarding border-line cases, which are always the difficult ones. With this explanation, I would ask the Committee to come to a decision so that we may go on doing the work we want to do and get this Bill on to the Statute Book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Lady for the care with which she has given the various processes, and also for the personal courtesy she has shown me between the two Sittings of the Committee. I do not know whether, as a result, her mind was more clear, but certainly mine was, and, therefore, I appreciate the spirit in which this has been put forward. However, I am bound to say that it is really the most extraordinary explanation I have ever heard of the way in which important matters like this, which are known to arouse great feeling in the country, are handled. The right hon. Lady said, "It was not until two days before the Second Reading of the Bill that I discovered that what is in the Amendment was not in the Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It was never to be put in the Bill. It was never considered or questioned that it should be put in the Bill. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that I knew everything in the Bill almost by heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee heard the explanation of the right hon. Lady and I suggest that what I have said is a fair comment on it. After all, she had the advantage of being able to read the statement which she made to the Committee, and I am quite prepared to be judged when we get the opportunity of seeing it in print. I understand that in preparing the speeches of Ministers for the Second Reading of the Bill, there came a point when the right hon. Lady used the phrase, "how it could be administered." I agree with her that it may very well be a matter of administration, but my difficulty is that one cannot calculate the number of displaced pupils until the school has, in fact, been established and taken into maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1246</span>
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three types of school for which grants can be paid. There is the substitute school and the transferred school and there is this school in which displaced pupils appear. The assumption with regard to the first is that one will have the same pupils in the new building. There can be no doubt, and I should like to emphasise it again as I did on Second Reading, that sometimes in educational legislation the word " school " means a building, and grant is paid on the building but not, in this respect, on the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the one grant which is made with regard to this type of school direct from the Ministry to the management or governors, because there is a desire to keep local authorities out of this particular transaction. The schools that are transferred or substituted do not come into our calculation today. There is one type and only one type of new school that ranks for grant. If a denomination, or for that matter any body of people other than the local authority, want to, establish a school, they make proposals; and if this is a new school no grant is. paid on it. They have to erect a school at their own expense, whether they are Roman Catholics, Church of England, Methodists or any other body who for some reason want to establish a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be some such schools into which displaced pupils come and the promoters of such a school, the people who make proposals, are entitled to a proportionate grant of their capital expenditure in exact proportion to the number of displaced pupils who come into the school. That is to say, if we have a school for 400 and on the day on which the school is established 100 pupils are displaced pupils a grant will be paid on a quarter of the capital cost of the school. If there are 200 a grant will be paid on a half, and if there are 300 it will be paid on three-quarters. Therefore, this grant cannot be calculated until the school is maintained and established. I am certain that what I have said so far cannot be controverted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me, therefore, that unless some words similar to those which we have in the Amendment dealing with the closing of accounts are included, we shall not be able to meet the point which, two days before the Second Reading of this Bill, the right hon. Lady apparently was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>
not quite sure she would be able to meet or not. We are told that there are five schools involved. Nobody can say what is the amount involved until the school is established, the admission register is examined and the previous history of the pupils in the school has been traced. There is very little between us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has encouraged me by saying that there is very little between us. I think that he will agree that we are not changing the procedure of Section 104 of the Act at all. We are going on in exactly the same way and there is no change whatsoever in the procedure of arranging displaced pupils' grants for schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been the assumption of my whole argument, and if I had not made it clear to the right hon. Lady I hope that I have made it clear to the rest of the Committee. The right hon. Lady says that nobody complained. I should like to say that I did not know that this conversation had taken place on 12th February, 1952. I was not there. I am not a Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic hierarchy do not send to me an account of what goes on between them and the Ministry, though they sometimes ask what I should do if I were in the right hon. Lady's place—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same as me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And I try to think very hard. But on 7th January this year my attention was called to this conversation and then I told members of the hierarchy who approached me that I was not in favour of retrospection. Two of my hon. Friends who are here this morning were with me. What was more, I said I was not going to enter into any auction, that is to say I was not going to say, "This is what the Government have said. I will try to go one better for you." But here was a pledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Tight hon. Gentleman will allow me, he has referred to 7th January. Perhaps I might remind him that I referred to the date of 17th December, on which there was an interview between my officer and the leading member of those who were negotiating. The whole thing had then been explained and there were no protests then or afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not here to defend the way in which the Roman Catholic hierarchy negotiated. Since 1918 I have been on the opposite side to them in a good many negotiations and as a result one knows the great advantage that comes from 1,500 or 1,600 years of consistent negotiations by one body. I am not going to defend it or attack it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is about the date that I want to be clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responsible for the fact that the right hon. Lady opposite interviewed some members of the hierarchy or their representatives on 17th December. They interviewed me on 7th January and my attention was then drawn for the first time to the very definite words that were included in the right hon. Lady's official minute of that interview. They have been quoted. They are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new definition would not be retrospective"—</p></blockquote>
There is nothing between the right hon. Lady and myself and my hon. Friends on that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the sense that grant on completed projects could be reassessed:"</p></blockquote>
I want to emphasise the words "completed projects." The minute goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"grant claims on schemes in progress"—</p></blockquote>
I have never assumed that that would be in doubt, because the proposed school has not ceased to be a proposed school by any definition and therefore the scheme in progress is lucky if during its progress the Royal Assent is given to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then occur the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"or for which accounts had not been closed"—</p></blockquote>
This was obviously a school which might have been established or maintained before the appointed day—whatever day is put in the Bill—for which the calculations which I have described had not been made and the accounts, either with the builders or with the right hon. Lady, had not been closed. These
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be eligible for review in the light of the new definition."</p></blockquote>
I do not imagine that even the right hon. Lady circulated this first document and then said to the people who came to see her, in elaborate words, "Take it or leave it." Quite obviously the

	<span class='label label-info column'>1249</span>
people who came to see the right hon. Lady were entitled to say, " We have read your document, but there are one or two words which we should like you to clear up, and there is something which is not in here at all but which we would like you to insert." The right hon. Lady normally would then say, "We are perfectly willing to consider them." But, in this issue, the circulated minute stated that these claims would be eligible for review in the light of a new definition. Did she put that up to anyone else or was that the last that was heard of it until the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary on Second Reading of this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make it clear that there was never any suggestion of putting those words into the Bill. That is perfectly clear and everybody is agreed on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that there was never any suggestion of inserting those words and when the Bill was printed and published it was never suggested that I had left out words which I had promised to insert. The question was how, when the Bill became law, the administration would be carried on in the case of schools that are being built at the present moment under the words that amended the definition of a displaced pupil. I then explained the difficulties, which I have already explained here. But I assure the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee—and I know that this is known by everybody who was concerned in the discussions—that there was never any suggestion of putting these words in the Bill. We had already agreed on words and the hierarchy had said that they were satisfied. The words in the Bill had been agreed upon and this has nothing to do with words to be inserted in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the right hon. Lady that I do not want to prolong this matter, but let us consider the stage at which we were when these words were suggested. The right hon. Lady had circulated a document which was to be the basis of a Bill, but she told us at our last meeting that there were some things in the document which are not in
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
the Bill and, as far as I know, there may be things in the Bill that were not in the document. Therefore, at that stage there were no pledges given that words would or would not go into the Bill. The clear statement which the right hon. Lady circulated was—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I get it clear? The right hon. Gentleman will remember that I sent out a memorandum. I gave him a copy and he probably has it in his possession. This amending of the definition of displaced pupils was dealt with in that memorandum, which went to all the denominations. The form of words in which we intended to make this Amendment was actually stated. We discussed this with the hierarchy and they were satisfied, as I have said, and there was no intention of adding to those words. The next thing that was discussed was the question of what could be the interpretation of those words in the administration of the scheme when those words became law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us proceed from there. Then it will not be the right hon. Lady's interpretation of the words that will settle the matter. Far too much educational legislation has been interpreted by local government auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it help if I said that I agree that it is not my words that will be concerned? That is where I went wrong. I thought of the words that I would like and the terms in which I would like this administered. I confess that it was then that there was legal advice that that could not be so, and that the statute has to be administered according to the words. Where I was wrong was in thinking that we could administer the matter like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady has now given to me and to those who agree with me on this matter the whole of our case. Let us face the fact that two great decisions in educational administration were made by local government auditors. The first was by Cockerton against the School Board for London, which led to the passing of the Education Act of 1902. That was a case where a very wily officer in her Department in those days put the London County Council up to objecting to the expenditure of the London School Board and, but for the Act of 1902, would have wiped out the teaching of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
cookery and handicrafts in London County Council schools. The second was the case of Crowe against the Lancashire County Council—after the Act of 1902— and the whole administration with regard to the law of repair of school playgrounds resulted from the defeat on that occasion of the local government auditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the right hon. Lady makes these grants, either the local government auditor or the Accountant-General who examines her accounts will say, " What is the statutory authority for this payment?" and it is not the kindly administration of the right hon. Lady and her intentions on the 12th February, 27th or 29th January, 1953, that will decide it; it will depend on what is in the statute. The right hon. Lady says that, in order to make sure that there shall be no challenge to her administration, if we put those words in here it will entail alterations in other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Lady wants to have statutory power behind her kindly administration she has the Government draftsman at her disposal. If it means that on the Report stage there would have to be a series of Amendments in order to carry out the intentions of my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish) she has ample facilities for seeing that that is done, and she can rest assured that those of us who support this Amendment will not oppose any subsequent Amendments which may be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman would agree that these would be far-reaching Amendments. Whatever were the arrangements for giving grants to schools in the 1944 Act, they were never mentioned in the memorandum that I sent to the other bodies concerned —to the local authorities or the teachers. It would be entirely wrong, and I should be breaking faith, if I now said that we were willing to have, throughout the Act, Amendments dealing with the real principle of the proposed schools, when I have never said it and the other people have not been consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady tells us that only five schools are involved. We do not ask for any Amendment going
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
beyond those five schools. If she really wanted to do this she would draft an Amendment that would put those five schools into a Schedule to the Bill and say that Section 104, as amended, applied to those five schools and no others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue is whether or not the right hon. Lady wants to do that. On Tuesday, every time she spoke, I thought she was saying that she would like to do it—and then she went off into a haze of words which really amounted to her saying that she was not going to do it. That seems to be the position today. There is an Amendment—I do not know whether it is proposed to call it—in the name of the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Hollis) to the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey. In this matter everybody on this side of the Committee is free to act for himself, but, as far as I am concerned, if the Amendment of the hon. Member for Devizes is called I propose to vote for it and then, when the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey, as amended, is put, I shall vote for that, because I am certain that the right hon. Lady can do this if she wants to, and limit it to the five schools concerned. The Government draftsman will provide her with the necessary words to ensure that nothing more than that is done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Hollis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there are two questions on which we are all agreed. First, we are anxious to reach a decision on this question as soon as possible. Secondly, as the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) has said, it would be disastrous to reach a decision by way of a Division if that could possibly be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put certain proposals before the Committee which might assist them to come to a decision on which we can all agree. There are two elements in the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish). One concerns the closing of accounts and the other concerns the date. We have all had our say with regard to the date and we all agree that that is the secondary matter, and certainly a matter upon which my right hon. Friend is in no way engaged; indeed, she feels herself to be engaged against it, because it has an element of retrospection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Bermondsey would agree to the deletion of the words
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
concerning the date, I think that would help us. We are then left with the simple issue of the accounts being closed. We could have a long argument about the merits of that, but I would remind the Committee that my right hon. Friend said that it was never envisaged that it should be incorporated in legislation. That is perfectly true. It was never envisaged because everybody imagined that it could be done by administrative action. That was why it was not thought necessary to incorporate it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill began its Second Reading I, at any rate, imagined that the question of the accounts being closed would be looked after by administrative action and during the course of the debate I asked my right hon. Friend specifically whether that was the case. Unfortunately, she did not have time to answer that point in her closing speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think my right hon. Friend and the rest of the Committee are agreed that the various bodies were given reason to think they would receive grants in respect of these schools. I think we are all agreed, also, that we are very anxious to find a way in which that can be done. As the right hon. Member for South Shields said, the issue is a narrow one and it would be the greatest tragedy if we could not bridge the gap between us. Speaking as a layman, I suggest that the simplest way would be for the Committee to accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bermondsey and then accept the Amendments which follow and which seek to leave out the date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possible objection to that, as my right hon. Friend clearly brought out, is that this Clause is dependent upon Section 104 of the 1944 Act. But surely at this moment we are engaged in amending that Section? Section 104 gives the Minister power to make grants only in respect of proposed schools, but subsection (2) of that Section specifically says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section…the expression displaced pupils' means…" and it then defines the expression for the purposes of that subsection. Why should there not also be a definition of the words "proposed schools" for the purposes of this Clause?</p></blockquote>
We need not go through the whole of the Bill. It would cause great chaos if we dealt with the definition of the words "proposed schools" throughout the whole of the 1944 Act. It would throw
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
out of gear matters which have nothing to do with displaced pupils. Alternatively, why not simply name specifically the relative schools, as was suggested by the right hon. Member for South Shields? We are simply a Committee and we can do this—and between now and the Report stage the draftsman and the Law Officers of the Crown could look at it. Then, on the Report stage, if it were found that there was a more tidy way of dealing with it, we could deal with it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to my right hon. Friend and the whole Committee to see if we cannot come to an agreement on some such lines as these, otherwise we shall go on talking about this for the rest of our lives. It is really not the business of this Committee to decide what is within their competence. If you see fit, Mr. Bowles, to call an Amendment it is our duty to discuss that Amendment on its merits and to take our decision accordingly. The proceedings are reduced to a farce if we discuss the merits of an Amendment for hours and are told at the end that we cannot accept it because it is beyond our competence. We laymen are entitled to assume that if an Amendment is called it is within our competence to take a decision on it. I appeal very strongly to the Committee to attempt to reach an agreement on the lines I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Llywelyn Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should remember at all times that the discussion should take place in the light of an agreed basis. At all stages in the educational development of this country since 1944 the only possible 	<i>modus operandi</i> has been an agreed basis. There have been many suggestions—some of them tacit—that that agreed basis is functioning with regard to this Amendment which we have been discussing for hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that that is not so. It is obvious that the Minister must have given an undertaking to the representatives of the Catholic hierarchy on 12th February, 1952; but I suggest that no unilateral agreement can be accepted. If we are to proceed at all satisfactorily in our educational advancement in these matters, we must have an agreed basis with the other interested bodies whose voices have not been heard in these discussions and who were not parties to the undertaking given to the Catholic hierarchy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1255</span>
I was surprised to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…it becomes even more important that the agreement reached between the Minister and the denominations in February last year should be honoured.…"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 27th January, 1953, c. 8.]</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt in the minds of the denominations what was agreed to by the Minister on that occasion. I have been in communication with the secretary of the Free Church Federal Council. He assured me that they have in no sense of the word been a party to the agreement which we have been discussing for hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Greenwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all in great doubt as to exactly what happened between the Minister and the various denominations. We naturally assumed that when she had put this proposal to the Roman Catholics she also put it to the other denominations. The difficulty is that we still do not know whether the Minister told the Roman Catholics that the other denominations could not agree to the suggestion she had made. If the Minister would be frank and tell us at what stage of the negotiations she indicated her change of attitude to the Roman Catholic Church, we should all find the position a good deal easier. I understand the confusion in my hon. Friend's mind, because I think it will be in all our minds until the right hon. Lady clarifies the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to clarify it if I may. The memorandum, which I also gave to the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede), was circulated to all the denominations, to local authorities, to teachers and all interested bodies. The discussions on that took place on what the words in the Bill should be. At no time was there any idea of a pledge to put these words into the Bill. I discussed exactly the same memorandum with all, and to all I said there would be no retrospection. In some cases the discussions were on what the administration would be and in other cases it was not. These words, which it is now suggested should be put into the statute, were never to go into the statute at that stage; there was no suggestion of that. If there ever had been a suggestion to put them in, I should naturally
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
have discussed it with other denominations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. L1. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest to the Committee that at all times the other denominations should be consulted on any specific point such as this. To clarify the situation, I can tell the Committee now that the Free Churches will not support the Amendment and are not a party to this extra concession, even although it may have the appearance of being an infinitesimal concession. They are opposed to any further concession beyond the agreed basis upon which the various denominations work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our trouble—and I hope I say this in no offensive spirit—is that when these concessions are made in the educational field, they are always precursors to further concessions. I must inform the Committee—and I speak for many thousands of people in this land—that opinion is hardening towards one section, one interested section, in the educational affairs of this land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I applaud my hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey (Mr. Mellish) for his loyalty and his devotion to his faith and I understand his desire to do everything he can for his faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. L. M. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. LI. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I cannot understand all the other people who are reaching over backwards in this matter. My hon. Friend referred, in what I thought was a very moving way, to the tremendous financial burden which people in his parish are carrying. I most sincerely applaud people who are prepared to sacrifice, as these Roman Catholics undoubtedly are sacrificing, for their faith. But this is where I speak from my own standpoint. If people will commit themselves to heavy burdens, when those burdens become intolerable they must not turn round to the State and say, "We cannot carry them "; because the obvious answer is, "Why did you incur these terrible commitments?" I believe the Committee must see things in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to conclude by reading a quotation from "The Christian World". It was written by a man whom we regard as our expert in religious education, and I think it should be read to the Committee because it might help us in what we are doing. The writer is Mr. Wilfred Rowland, and this is what he said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1257</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In recent years it has become customary to hold private conferences with those whose interests are known to clash. Such a method undoubtedly does much to ensure the smooth passage of a Parliamentary Bill. But the method will assuredly fail if agreed Measures are brought before Parliament and then amended under the pressure of sectional interests."</p></blockquote>
That is the voice of the Free Church. I urge the Minister not to yield to the pressure which has been exerted upon her in the Committee hitherto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Grimond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I can be accused of sectional interest in this matter. The Bill does not apply to Scotland and I am not a member of the Roman Catholic Church, nor is there even a significant body of Roman Catholics in my constituency. With all due respect to the hon. Member for Abertillery (Rev. Ll. Williams), I think it would be unfortunate if we rejected the purpose of the Amendment for no reason which I have heard on merit other than that the concession goes to a particular faith in this country. After all, it is agreed that denominations of all kinds should have concessions. The only point is whether these five schools shall or shall not benefit to the same extent as others from some assistance from the Government. That is the only point at issue. and up to now there is 90 per cent. or 99 per cent. agreement on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister herself has shown every sympathy towards this request and has said that, if she could, she would like to meet it. Is it to be said that the Committee is unable to give expression to the wish of 99 per cent. of its members because it is very difficult to draft the wording? I was completely convinced by the argument of the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) and the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Hollis). If it is only a question of drafting, surely we have at our disposal enough experts to overcome that difficulty, if necessary by adding a Clause to cover these five schools. There was a difficulty over retrospection though it seems to me a narrow point to argue that 14th November is retrospective. It is a point which only schoolmasters or theologians would make. It is like the controversy as to how many angels can sit on the point of a needle. However, even that point has been abandoned. We are now only arguing whether five schools should, or should not, be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1258</span>
There seems to be a wide belief that the Minister gave some undertaking, but whether she gave it or not, the fact remains that the will of this Committee is in favour of giving some assistance to these five schools. All we ask of the Minister is that she should consult the very eminent ladies and gentlemen at her disposal to give effect to this wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have listened with patience, and sometimes with impatience, for some four hours to this very interesting debate, and I think those of us who intervene now have only one object—and that is to point a way by which the Committee may reach a conclusion which will be widely agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal of sympathy with what was said by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond). At the same time, as one who has been engaged in past years on these discussions within the denominations—I was on the Church of England side—I understand the point of view put by the hon. Member for Abertillery (The Rev. Ll. Williams). The Minister is in a much stronger position and Parliament is doing its work better if, as far as possible, a Bill emerges from the Parliament in a way which will command the goodwill of all those sectional authorities intimately concerned with its subsequent working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see only one point of weakness in the case which the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland made. I understand that the Minister gave a firm pledge to the Free Churches that there would be no retrospection. If the hon. Member's suggestion were adopted and the Bill were skilfully drafted so as to make crystal clear that the five schools in question could benefit from the new provisions, there might be—and the Committee is not in a position to know for certain —some breach of the definite pledge about retrospection. Is it possible, between now and the next stage of the Bill, to remove that doubt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that it might mean that the Minister would have to approach the denominations again or to approach the Free Churches again and would have to explain to them that there might be a certain doubt about these five schools. I can well understand that it might depend on the date on which the Bill re-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1259</span>
ceives Royal Assent and the date on which the schools are, or have been, opened. But the eventual result for the future of education would be far better if we could put those five schools, or four of them, or whatever the number may be, into the Bill with the goodwill of everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I hope it may be possible, on some such understanding as that, for the Amendment to be withdrawn, the Committee having made it perfectly clear to the Government that it hopes that the five schools can be included but is anxious, if possible, to include them with the goodwill of all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Hampstead (Mr. H. Brooke), that it would be far better if we could avoid a vote on this Amendment. I hope that all those Nonconformists and Catholics here will understand that I am interested in the cause of education. It is difficult to understand, after having listened for a number of hours, what it was that the Catholics understood when they spoke to the Minister. The Minister says she has not been accused of any breach of faith at all, and I am prepared to believe that, but, on the other hand, my hon. Friend the Member for Abertillery (Rev. Ll. Williams) expressed some doubt on the point, and having read most of the documents, it seems to me that the Catholics may have been in a strong position in saying that they understood that something more would be written in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Abertillery is not an anti-Catholic; he is a Nonconformist. In the same way, I am not a Catholic but I am not an anti-Catholic. As chairman of one of the divisional executives, I have a responsibility for administration of our schools. It is not always easy to reach a conclusion on what burdens the Catholics are bearing in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I shall not weary the Committee but I want to mention an experience of my own arising from the Bill. It may be recalled that the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Morley), referred to the fact that 97 per cent. of all the continuing cost of county education was borne by rates and taxes. I am not suggesting that that is not so. I have tried to find out what sort of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
burden is borne in the City of Leeds, which has a large Catholic element, and I put down a Question to try to find out what amount was paid from rates and taxes and what sort of contribution the Catholics themselves made. I got a very dusty answer from the Table; I was told that it was for the City of Leeds to give the answer. I therefore wrote to the Town Clerk of the City of Leeds—and apparently the City of Leeds does not keep its accounts in such order that it can easily dissect them so as to give to Members of Parliament information about what is the percentage of the cost of Catholic education borne not by Catholics but by the State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ralph Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend has misunderstood me. I did not say 97 per cent. of the cost of Catholic schools was borne by rates and taxes but that 97 per cent. of all denominational schools, which includes the Church of England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to the figures of the Catholic schools. I am dealing with the constituency which I represent, and I have been trying to find out what this burden is in terms of finance. In North-west Kent, where I have some authority in this matter and can give instructions for the figures to be produced, the figures for three authorities, those of Dartford, Crayford, and Erith, show that the percentage borne by the management is 1.2 in the first case, .83 in the second and 1.2 in the third.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. J. Mellish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is now talking about maintenance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pannell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to dodge the issue. I only want to point out that these percentages do not convey any idea of the sort of burden involved. I have been trying to find out, and I find that a percentage of .83, which does not sound very much, actually means £900 to a comparatively small community. I hope the Minister will instruct local education authorities in the future to keep their accounts in such a way as will enable Members of Parliament genuinely seeking information to obtain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sidney Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After a very prolonged discussion, in which much has been said that is no use whatever,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
obviously, there are two questions to consider, and one is in regard to the word " retrospective." I can well understand the Minister sticking to her guns in regard to it, because, obviously, what she meant when she used the word "retrospective," to which she now adheres, must have been clearly in her mind. I think the dubiety which my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead (Mr. Brooke) mentioned obviously arose after that period had been fixed in her mind and she had said to some of the parties that there could be no retrospection in the case of this particular denomination, which seems to be so much to the fore in this discussion, but which is only one of very many in the country and must not be allowed to occupy all the stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A doubt arose in their minds as to what the Minister meant by retrospection in the discussions which have taken place, but I think the question has been narrowed down this morning to a matter of only five schools. I think the Minister herself, when she said a year ago that there must be no retrospection, had a definite idea in her mind what she meant, and that, subsequently, we find that the difficulty really applies to only five schools. I think the Minister probably could, without for a moment violating her conscience, have regard to the fact that the five schools in question, which apparently belong to one denomination, might be regarded as coming within the ambit of the word retrospective, which the Minister herself definitely said did not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in consideration of that fact, we might now agree that, regarding the five schools—I imagine that the actual cash involved is not very large, and that is not the principal consideration—the Minister could, without violating her conscience or going away from the pledge she has given to other denominations, say that, while she sticks to her point in regard to retrospection, those schools would qualify and would have a right to qualify under the circumstances. That is the suggestion which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead. I am hoping that, having discussed the matter for a long time—and, however long we might discuss it, we might never come to full agreement—we might now reach a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady did say that no protest was received from the. Bishops, the Catholic hierarchy or the representatives of Catholic parents, that there was anything wrong about it. May I read her a sentence from a letter of 13th December, 1952, written by the Bishop of Brentwood:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I regret that you have not felt able to make this Clause retrospective in the same way as Clause 9. As you have righted for the future what we consider is a wrong done to voluntary schools, we hoped that you would give justice in full measure by restoring the position which would have existed had not the Amendment to the present Section 104 been introduced in the House of Lords in 1944."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has nothing to do with this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir S. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see where that applies in the present argument at all. I thought that we had got beyond the position about the word retrospective, and that we were trying to find a way in which the Committee and the Minister could agree. Now, we have pin-pointed five schools, and the position of the Minister regarding retrospection in the sense in which she meant it is not called in question. I think the Minister may now accept the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead that the five schools may be specially dealt with, and in that way the difficulty could be overcome. At the same time, I think the Minister would agree that there would be no violation of the pledge she has given, and that we could still regard the word "retrospective," in the sense in which she used it, as being still valid in the Bill. I hope that, without much further discussion, we may be able to come to a conclusion very soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mellish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope we may now bring the discussion to a conclusion. I am prepared to accept the Amendments suggested by the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Hollis).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mellish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the assumption that you would allow it to be moved, Mr. Bowles, I would be prepared to accept it, but I hope we shall not come to a Division on this matter. The Minister can take up the position which she has indicated, and I am sure that I can speak for the Catholic hierarchy in saying that they have great respect for her ability

and sincerity. The right hon. Lady has indicated that she has taken the sense of the Amendment, and that she wants to help us if she can. If she is willing and prepared to look at this matter again on Report stage, we on our part are willing to withdraw our Amendment. Would the right hon. Lady indicate that she will do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be perfectly honest and sincere with the Committee. The hon. Gentleman asks if I will look at it again on Report stage if he withdraws the Amendment. I want to be absolutely fair. What has been proposed in this Amendment, as I have tried several times to point out, could not be done. The change would have to be made right through Section 104, and probably in other parts of the Act as well; in other words, we should have to insert some words in an important part of the 1944 Act, which we never set out to amend, and which nobody has ever suggested should be amended until we came here. That is the reason why I say that this particular Amendment could not be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked if I would consider this. I would like to tell hon. Members, and I think they will probably believe me, that it would not be honest for me to say at present "I know a way of getting round this difficulty; I know we can meet the wishes of the Committee." I have made it perfectly clear that I would refuse any Amendment going beyond what we have set out to do in amending the definition of displaced pupils, and what I have said today goes as far as I possibly can go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties is that there is a doubt, as I see it, even about the five schools. We have narrowed the matter down to the question whether they are in or remain outside, but I should not be honest if I were to say definitely that I will consider this again, because, at present, I cannot see how to do it. I am anxious to help, but I should not be honest if I told the Committee that I know I shall be able to meet the point. I will go on struggling to find a solution, and if anybody has any ideas on the matter I will gladly look at them, but nobody has yet been able to offer a suggestion for any Amendment that would meet the case, and we cannot find one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear about what is meant by the last few words of the right hon. Lady. This matter cannot be raised on the Report stage except by recommitting the Bill, and unless we get a Government assurance that the right hon. Lady will either put down an Amendment herself—or at least give support, or not raise objections to, a Motion being put down to re-commit the Bill in order to discuss this particular matter—the Report stage is no use to us. The draftsmen are represented here, and the whole of the discussion has been heard. Does the right hon. Lady say that it would not be possible to mention these five schools in a Schedule?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister in that I do not want the definitions of a proposed school widened, except in so far as it may be necessary to bring in the five schools within the Minister's statement this morning. I do not think anybody in the Committee, as far as I have heard, has suggested that anything more can be done. This is a small point, and I thought that the Minister might accept my hon. Friend's Amendment, with the suggested Amendment of her hon. Friend the Member for Devizes, and, if that does not satisfy the draftsmen, or if it is too wide in scope, the Minister could put that right on the Report stage. Otherwise, I think the right hon. Lady ought to give us a pledge that we shall be able to discuss this matter on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly could not accept the Amendment on the Order Paper, and I have tried to give my reasons. It would mean a wider Amendment, to which the right hon. Gentleman opposite himself referred. That is clear, and it cannot be done. I am trying to be completely honest with the Committee, and at present I cannot see a way of getting round this difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If 1 or anybody else could see a way of getting round this difficulty I should be extremely glad, and in that case, I should be only too willing to deal with the point on the Report stage. But at the present moment I cannot assure the Committee that we can find a scheme which would satisfactorily cover the point. I think the Committee realise that we ought not to go farther and make wide Amendments in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether the Committee might like to come to a decision. I have no power to stop discussion until it becomes repetitive, though it is getting a bit repetitive. Is it the pleasure of the Committee that I put the Question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, Hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. G. Cove</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only want to detain the Committee for a minute or two to say that, as the right hon. Lady has adopted the kind of attitude she has, I intend to vote against the Amendment. Having regard to that fact, I think I ought to say one or two things very briefly. No one can accuse me from past history of having any animus towards the Roman Catholic schools, or any other denominational schools. I have accepted for a long time the fact that there is a dual system, and I know very well that such a system will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An hon. Member asked whether we could not meet the difficulty of these five schools with goodwill. To me that is the whole crux of the issue. I hope my hon. Friends will pardon me, but from my experience I must say that some of my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee are somewhat out of focus as far as the whole of the Labour Party is concerned. I have heard it said outside by quite a number of hon. Members of my own party that we should not budge an inch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to adopt that attitude, and I think it would be a good thing if the Amendment were withdrawn in order that we might proceed with goodwill with what is contained in the provisions of the Bill. Therefore, I must retain my freedom of action in supporting what I think is best in the long run for the denominational schools, that is, the maintenance of goodwill rather than agreeing to piecemeal arrangements at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mellish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to withdraw my Amendment. It cannot be said that I have not tried to get some decision on this matter without being difficult in any way with the various points of view of the Committee. But the right hon. Lady has really not shown any goodwill at all in this matter. Had she wished, she could have found a way round this. She could have contacted the Parliamentary draftsmen and tried to meet the point,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
but she has not. What she says is, "I want to help, but I cannot, and I am not going to any way." If the right hon. Lady really believed that this was something that was justified, she could have found an answer to it earlier on. I hope hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will support my Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gilbert Longden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my right hon. Friend one question? It now looks as if this matter will be put to the vote, and there is one point on which I am not clear. The point made by the hon. Member for Abertillery (Rev. Ll. Williams) is one with which the whole Committee agrees—that is, to bring about these changes on the basis of agreement. The document of 12th February says in one breath that there shall be no retrospection, and in the next goes on to say that the Minister will make provision for schools whose accounts have not been closed, although it was not intended, perhaps, to put it into the Bill. Did my right hon. Friend give the impression to the Roman Catholics that she would make provision for such schools, and did she send a document to all the interested bodies including the other denominations. If so, can my right hon. Friend say whether she received from the other denominations any objection to the Clause, and, if so, did she communicate it to the Roman Catholics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. F. H. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put one further question to the right hon. Lady? Did she tell the subsequent deputations she met from the other churches of the promise given to the Roman Catholic hierarchy on 12th February?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Horsbrugh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The memoranda sent out stated my intentions at that time. As to the Amendment concerning displaced pupils, it actually stated the words. The discussions took place on what was going into the Bill. All the bodies concerned had the same memoranda, and all were told what was going into the Bill and that there would be no retrospection. I think we have that clear. The Roman Catholics asked for a further explanation of retrospection. They never suggested that anything should be put into the Bill explaining retrospection, but they thought it meant that any school could benefit if it had begun to be built before the Bill became an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that we did not mean that, and there was quite a considerable discussion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1267</span>
concerning the various points covered by the words we had agreed. It was thought at that time that the words that had been 'agreed and the words in Section 104 covered the point. But they did not cover the point, as I think anybody who has looked at them will agree. We therefore took the new definition which goes further in one way about schools under construction. That is the only clear definition we can get of what the Bill as drafted sets out to do as an Amendment for Section 104.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum put to all parties was the same; the words of the Amendment defining the new displaced pupils were the same, and it was made clear that there would be no retrospection. At all the meetings we discussed points which would arise out of the Bill, and the facts in the Bill were put to all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not want to alter the definition of the proposed schools so I am to that extent against the Amendment, but if the churches generally would agree to the incorporation of additional schools, I should be only too happy, because I am entirely in favour of the maximum freedom for parents in education.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I have not had any time to consider that.

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maude</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 17, after "enactments," to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"contained in public, general and local Acts."</p></blockquote>
This is a very small drafting Amendment in which I think that neither political nor religious feelings are involved. There exists neither in the parent Act of 1944 nor in the present Bill a definition of the word "enactments." It is, therefore, at least open to question and doubt whether the expression in Clause 1 of this Bill namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the enactments relating to housing or to town and country planning,…"</p></blockquote>
may perhaps be limited to the public, general legislation on this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two local authorities have expressed some apprehension that local Acts might be excluded from the scope of the Bill as it is drafted at present. There are, in fact, one or two—not many—local Acts which provide for the movement of population, in particular certain Manchester Corporation Acts providing for the transfer of population to Bowlee and Wythenshawe. It is clearly designed, in order to carry through the intention of this Bill, that the transfer of population under local Acts relating to housing and planning should fall within the scope of the Bill, and I have no doubt that it was the intention of my right hon. Friend that that should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly possible that my right hon. Friend, or the Parliamentary Secretary, may have been advised that the present wording of the Clause is adequate to include local Acts. It may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
so. I myself should require to be satisfied in the very strongest terms on this, because it seems to me that if local authorities are disturbed, however slightly, about the possibilities, then there is everything to be said for making the matter crystal clear beyond any doubt. It is infinitely less trouble and it is much cheaper, even at the cost of a few words —however repugnant their insertion may be to the Parliamentary draftsmen who believe them unnecessary—to insert those words than to have the question decided in the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary is going to assure the Committee that these words are unnecessary I should like to know quite clearly why it has been thought desirable by Parliamentary draftsmen to include precisely this definition in other statutes, where it was clear that the inclusion of local Acts was intended. There are about half-a-dozen of those statutes. They include the Water Act, 1945, in Section 59, the New Towns Act, 1946, in Section 26, the Electricity Act, 1947, the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, the Gas Act, 1948, and, to take a precedent from the legislation of the present Government, the Magistrates' Courts Act, 1952, where it appears in Section 126. It seems to me that I am asking for a simple Amendment. If my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary says that it is unnecessary, I hope that he will be able to convince the Committee that there is no possible legal doubt that might lead to litigation in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Education (Mr. Kenneth Pickthom)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend was rather tempting Providence when he began to say that this would not arouse any political or religious passions, but so far he has managed to keep within that promise and I hope that I can do so too. I should like, of course, to accept this argument, but my information is that really the argument is not wildly but is decisively, misguided. I do not think that there is any doubt at all. I have the great advantage in explaining the law, knowing nothing about it, of relying upon experts, and I do not think that there is any doubt that the word " enactments," in its natural and ordinary meaning, does include enactments in any Act whether public, general or local. Therefore, I think that these words are superfluous,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
and in the main one ought not to put superfluous words in a statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is rather more in it than that. I had been warned of the Acts to which my right hon. Friend has referred which do use the formula which he prefers. I am informed that there is really nothing more specific to be said than that it must be assumed that there was some special reason in those statutes, that nobody can discover any special reason in this proposed statute and that if there is a special reason in this Bill then the formula as it appears should stand, as it appears in other places in the principal Act. If that is so, if the authoritative opinion is—and it is—that the effect which my hon. Friend requires is obtained by this formula, and the formula as printed is the formula which appears in the principal Act of 1944—it would be a pity to have a different formula in this Bill from the formula in the principal Act. Although I hope that I have understood and sympathised with the proposal, for those reasons I hope that the Committee will not think it necessary to make the alteration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary said—and I cannot quite follow any reason for it—that there was a difference between the principal Act in this case and the other Acts to which the hon. Member for Ealing, South (Mr. Maude) referred with regard to the use of these words. Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us why it was important to put these words into the other Acts and why it is important to leave them out in this Bill? It is either right or it is wrong to insert them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickthorn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very bad law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Janner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one listens to the Parliamentary Secretary one sometimes never knows what is right or wrong. Either the words in this Bill should apply to all Acts or the words in other Acts should apply to this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickthorn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the most extraordinary propositions from lawyers, but I think that is the most extraordinary ever put—that these words should be either in this Bill or, if they are not, they should not be in other statutes. Naturally, neither I nor my advisers have had an opportunity to examine these Acts
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
thoroughly. There may have been, and must be assumed to have been, special reasons why the longer formula was used in those statutes, but in the present Bill I am advised that the formula as printed has all the effects required by hon. Members and is identical with the formula in the principal Act. I should have thought it common sense that when we have three or four Acts depending upon the principal Act it is better in that case that the formula in each of the dependent statutes should be the same as the one in the parent statute. That is the whole case, as I understand it, and I think it is simple enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question? If this Bill is within the framework of the other Act, which sets forth the formula, the formula in the 1944 Act includes the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…in consequence of any movement of population or of any action taken or proposed to be taken under the enactments relating to housing or to town and country planning,…"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is going beyond the Ruling of the Chair. He is trying to argue the Amendment which I did not select.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lever</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not argue anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Member is doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maude</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary for his explanation. In order to get it absolutely crystal clear I ought to put two questions to him and then, if the answers to those questions are satisfactory, I think that I can say that the purpose which I had in moving the Amendment has been completely fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, while I concede the argument that the word "enactments" alone without qualification appears throughout the principal Act, we ought to be certain that the Manchester Corporation Acts, which refer to the transfer of population, for example to Bowlee and Wythenshawe, were not enacted after the passing of the principal Act because that in fact might make a difference. In other words, what was covered by the wording in the principal Act might not be covered now, and about that we ought to have an answer.

Secondly, can the Parliamentary Secretary assure us quite categorically that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1273</span>
transfers of population under the Manchester Corporation and similar Acts will, in fact, be covered by the wording of the present Act and that no school will find itself unable to obtain grants without deciding the matter in the courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Parliamentary Secretary replies, I would like to put another matter to him. I know no more about the law than the Parliamentary Secretary and, therefore, when the hon. Gentleman tells us that his legal advice is that the word " enactments " will mean public, general and local Acts, what I am interested in is the question whether there. is anything which a layman can understand on which that ruling is based. Is there any statute containing an interpretation Clause which says in effect, " This is what the word enactments ' means unless there is a special reason to the contrary "? Or has a case ever been decided that has had the effect of determining what "enactments" means? If we have nowhere in our law a definition of " enactments," I suggest that a short Measure to provide for that might be more useful than some of the legislation which the Government introduce from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that what the hon. Member for Ealing, South (Mr. Maude) wishes to secure is that where matters relating to housing and town and country planning result in populations being moved, not always at their own wish, and that is caused by anything which is an Act of this Parliament, that case should be covered. That is a point in which probably the whole of the Committee will be interested. If the Parliamentary Secretary has any doubt—and I am even less of a lawyer than he is or my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, East (Mr. M. Stewart)—I hope that steps will be taken on the Report stage to see that the matter is put right. If the Parliamentary Secretary describes himself as a lawyer as "zero," I am very much "under minus" in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickthom</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a judgment about the case of Wythenshawe and Bowlee. If I did it would have no effect. But I cannot believe that the word "enactment" has not been very frequently used by the law and, whether or not it has been statutorily defined, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
cannot believe that competent lawyers are in any doubt of its meaning. It has a natural, ordinary meaning which has been used in the courts for many centuries. I do not think it is necessary to say any more on this comparatively minor point except that if, between now and the Report stage, it is found, by any hon. Member or I myself, that I have in any way misled the Committee, the Government will give every facility for it to be put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maude</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can have the assurance of the hon. Gentleman that between now and the Report stage he will have one final look at this question, I shall ask leave to withdraw the Amendment. The right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) puts the point in a nutshell. The desire of the Committee is that this Clause shall cover every single Act of Parliament—whether it be a public, general or local Act—dealing with transfers of populations through housing or town and country planning. If my hon. Friend can give me the assurance that he will make doubly sure that that is so I shall ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickthorn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all desire that to be the effect. We all thought that that was the effect of the word in the principal Act. I believe the Manchester Act, of which he spoke, is covered. If there is any point on which I have been at all wrong I shall certainly see that every effort is made to make doubly or trebly sure that this word is competent to do what the whole Committee want done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maude</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, " That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause that we are now considering is not the one that we started discussing on Tuesday morning. An important Amendment has been made and I want to draw the attention of the Committee and the right hon. Lady to the circumstances in which the change was made. No one can say that the Division that took place was a party one.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1275</span>
If it were, some hon. Members who sit behind her are going to get into severe trouble when they next see the Patronage Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not all my hon. Friends found it possible to vote with me. Three of my hon. Friends who are Nonconformists, just as I am, proved the strength of their nonconformity by not conforming with me on this matter. In the consideration that will undoubtedly have to be given by the Government to this amended Clause in the period between now and the Report stage, I hope that it will be borne in mind that without there being any announcement of a free vote something perilously approaching a free vote actually took place. No hon. Member ever votes against his own side except under very considerable compunction. In the spirit of what was involved, on a very narrow issue, hon. Members gave a free expression of their opinion and the right hon. Lady will have been comforted to some extent by the fact that one or two hon. Members who had expressed sympathy with the Amendment voted against it in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have already said in these few remarks should not be taken to indicate that I am casting any reflection on them. We all know the difficulties under which people work in Parliamentary circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the remarks she made the right hon. Lady indicated—and I was not able to dissent from it—that to give effect to the Amendment might involve other Amendments to the principal Act and to this Bill. I should like to see those Amendments reduced to the minimum and I would also make it clear that as far as my hon. Friends are concerned they do not desire any alteration in the definition of "proposed school" other than that which would bring in the five schools which were the basis of our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to achieve so simple a purpose it is clear that drafting questions arise which are beyond the competence of private Members who have not the advantage of access to Government draftsmen. I therefore ask the right hon. Lady to accept the view that we voted this morning on a very narrow and limited issue and by our votes declared in favour of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>
these five schools being brought in. I hope that between now and the Report stage the right hon. Lady will find it possible to accept the decision of this morning's Division as something that has no party significance but represents the genuine view of Members after a prolonged discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody can say that this matter was rushed. I think I should apologise to the Committee for the length of some of the speeches I found it difficult to avoid delivering. I had to accept the difficulty as being insuperable. If the right hon. Lady can accept this morning's decision in the spirit in which it was taken I am quite certain that nothing but good will result and I would hope that on the Report stage we shall find that the Amendments to the principal Act are not so numerous as we were at one time led to believe, and that she will instruct the Parliamentary draftsmen to accept the decision of the Committee in principle and endeavour to embody the necessary Amendments to make it operative but not too extensive. In that way we shall not have wasted the rather more than four hours which we devoted to this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hubert Ashton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like many other hon. Members, I have listened to this discussion on Clause 1 for four and a half hours. This Clause is part of a Bill the fundamental object of which is to help voluntary schools, or church schools, as they are more widely known. After a great deal of discussion the difference between us has been whittled down to some four or five schools. Before we move from this Clause it would be a pity if it should be felt, by implication or what is on the record, that it is only the Roman Catholic community which takes enormous trouble over its schools. Brentwood is not in my constituency but I live there. I am very fully posted on the activities of the Roman Catholic schools there and I have a great admiration for them; but less than 20 miles from here, where I live, there is a Church of England school of which we are extremely proud. We hope to continue it as an aided school and we are making great sacrifices for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our problems today is that the various Christian denominations cannot get closer together. I do not want to apportion blame in any shape or form. We have these four or five schools; I do
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
not know if they are Jewish, Church of England or Roman Catholic, and I do not want to know. If they are on the side of getting a little more help for the Church schools I say good luck to them. It is against that background that I voted for this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulties confronting my right hon. Friend. It is very difficult to negotiate these questions; but I agree with the right hon. Member for South Shields Mr. Ede) that the point we have in mind can be properly and amicably settled as he has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Slater</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my right hon. Friend I am a Nonconformist and I voted in favour of the Amendment. Irrespective of what the Free Church Council has had to say to the hon. Member for Abertillery (Rev. Ll. Williams), I would say that I am very busy as an individual member of the Methodist movement and the Methodist Church, but I have certain convictions with regard to the application that has been made in the course of this discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency there are Church schools which are under the Protestant denomination and which are operating along with Roman Catholic schools, and I say that it is the responsibility of everyone to give some consideration to dealing with all the religious sections of our community. Some time ago I read in the "Church Chronicle" that there were more than 11,000 of these voluntary schools in England and Wales. That is a tremendous number. Nine thousand were Church of England schools and 1,800 were Roman Catholic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody knows that the burden that has to be borne by these voluntary schools under the terms of the 1944 Act has in no way been eased, owing to the increased costs. If the figures that were published last year are correct—and they have been passed on to me—over £50 million is involved in meeting the building programme of the Catholic schools. A great part of this cost is in connection with the building of their new schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hitherto no grant was paid but under this Clause power is to be given to the Minister to make a grant of up to 50 per cent. in respect of these schools. Everyone knows that great batches of children and families are being moved from one part of the country to another.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
That is occurring in my own constituency, where people are being moved into the new town of Newton Aycliffe, which is to have a population of between 10,000 and 20,000, and accommodation has to be found for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased that some assistance is to be given to the denominational schools under this Bill. The reason why I voted in favour of the Amendment was was that it was not doing anything in regard to retrospective payment. When we reach the Report stage I hope the position will be clarified, and that a true form of agreement can be reached on this particular matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Harvey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Ashton) I voted in favour of this Amendment. I am obliged to the right hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) for the very able and generous way in which he summed up the Division which has just taken place. I was forced to come to a conclusion very largely upon the issue of agreement. I listened with great sympathy to the views of the hon. Member for Abertillery (Rev. Ll. Williams). I want to make it clear that I belong to the Roman Catholic Church, and I voted as I did because in this matter the Roman Catholics were proceeding upon the assumption, rightly or wrongly, that it had been agreed that this matter should be part of this Bill, or should be dealt with under this Bill. If we had proceeded upon the assumption that that was not the basis of agreement, then by moving in one direction we should have taken a retrograde step in another direction. I regret that I had to make a decision contrary to the wishes of the Minister. Having had a long association with education, I have always felt it desirable that party politics should as far as possible be kept out of an issue like this.	<div class='sup'>*</div> <!-- sup --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frederick Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to endorse what has been said by the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Ian Harvey). May I tell my hon. Friend the Member for Abertillery (Rev. Ll. Williams) that I have not been subjected in any way to pressure, religious or party. The Amendment has been discussed to-	<div class='u'>day from a non-party point of view. I</div> <!-- u -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>1279</span>
have tried to look at the Bill and the position of the denominational schools from an objective point of view. I am not attached to the denomination of my hon. Friend or to that of my hon. Friend 'the Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. L. M. Lever), but I believe there is a good case for some measure of retrospection and a good general case for giving the necessary assistance for new schools in new housing estates in new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise that some Members of the Committee are even now under a misapprehension about the implications of the Clause. It will not affect denominational schools outside in the country. It concerns only schools in new towns and new housing estates. In my constituency there are several schools belonging to the Roman Catholic community and they will have to face a tremendous financial burden under the development plan. The financial burden is estimated to be £160,000. In the county of Cumberland they will have to Lind another £500,000 under the development plan. That is a tremendous burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we realise it or not, a dual system of education is here. We have a compromise system unlike that of America or Australia. While we do not go as far as Scotland or Holland, we have a compromise system confirmed by the Education Act, 1944, and confirmed by this amending Bill. I would remind those who take a hostile view of denominational schools of the words of the then Minister of Education when the 1944 Act was proposed. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would ask those who feel deeply to dismiss from their minds the wholly unwarrantable view that the Government desire either to tear away church schools from unwilling managers or to force them inhumanely out of business."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th January. 1944: Vol. 396, c. 229.]</p></blockquote>
I think we all agree with those words. We do not seek to economise these schools out of existence but rather to give them the necessary assistance through the framework of an agreed Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter affects religious communities and it is to the credit of the Committee that we have discussed it without bitterness and without prejudice. Irrespective of community and school, we should always think about the child in the school. We should bear that in mind with
	<span class='label label-info column'>1280</span>
any school, whether it belongs to a Roman Catholic community, a Church of England community or a Jewish community. If the child's position is in danger in that school because of inadequate buildings and facilities, we have a right, as Parliament, to see that such defects are remedied so that the children, irrespective of the religious faith of their parents are given the proper education which we believe is their birthright under this system. I have great pleasure in supporting the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Cole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the debate we have had on the Clause has shown the great interest, strength and belief in the preservation of the church schools of this country and, if I may venture a personal opinion, may that ever be so. As I said on Second Reading, the church schools of this country are the foundation of British education. I trust they will ever remain with us in their strength and that we may even see more of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask my right hon. Friend to bear in mind the points I made on Second Reading. First, I deplore the effects of the limited definition of displaced pupils. I must point out to my right hon. Friend that there are many circumstances, other than those due to housing and town planning, which cause parents and their children to move to different parts of the country. There have been large movements of population in parts of my constituency in the past, quite irrespective of housing and town planning, and 1 am certain that that has also been the case in other constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman but he is going outside the Money Resolution.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cole</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I think I have made the point. In conclusion, I ask the Minister to take the opportunity offered by this welcome Bill to be as generous as possible to all denominations. I am sure we all welcome the Bill very much. It will be a great help, and I hope my right hon. Friend will give all the encouragement she can to church schools in this country, even to increasing their

	<span class='label label-info column'>1281</span>
number. I hope she will not stop within the limits of the present arrangements given by this Bill but will increase the benefits to the church schools. I have great pleasure in supporting the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say how pleasant it is, as a Whip, to take part in a debate when the Whips are not on. This debate has cut completely across party lines and even denominational lines. Here am I, speaking as an ex-Anglican choirboy, having voted with a clear conscience on the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickthorn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A choirboy with a clear conscience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a schoolmaster I have the utmost admiration for what the Catholic and Church schools have done since 1945. They have made enormous sacrifices. I know of a school in my division—St. Marie's School, Rugby—where the mothers of the children carried pails of cement to help with the building of a new hut and where the men spent hours wiring the hut. The sacrifices which mothers and fathers have made, where their children go to these voluntary schools, are enormous. This Bill will be some slight encouragement to them and I welcome the vote this morning in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Commander J. W. Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our trouble in the last four hours has been that we have been experiencing the difficulties of progress by agreement. It is essential that we should continue to progress by agreement. I appreciate the position in which the Minister found herself; the fires of disagreement are not all heated on one side, and I am quite certain she felt she was committed and could not concede what the Committee wanted her to concede.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister whether, between now and the Report stage, she will take further steps to progress by agreement so that we may arrive at the Report stage with a Bill on which we are all agreed and which needs no amendment. I ask her to try to continue that progress by agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we dispose of the Clause, I think we are entitled to know from the Minister whether or not a promise was given to the Roman Catholic hierarchy about the claims of schools where the accounts had not been
	<span class='label label-info column'>1282</span>
closed and whether that promise was divulged to other deputations which came to meet her. She did not give a clear answer to the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot go back to the debate on the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We require from the Minister a clear definition of the words "established" and "proposed." Much will depend on this definition. There has been no recent definition of those words. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to the words of my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points which I wish to make quickly. The first is to underline what the right hon. Member for South Shields has said—that there is almost general agreement in the Committee on a desire to help voluntary schools. I would point out that it was only because the method of achieving it was by altering the definition of a proposed school that many of us on this side voted "No." We are in favour of voluntary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Committee is so largely in support of the Minister, ought we not to regard the issue rather like the case of a family which has been given a fine bicycle by a very good father?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ede</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have we to put on crash helmets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a push cycle. Unfortunately, he has omitted to give us a pump and, in asking about the pump we are in danger of entirely forgetting the extreme generosity of the father in giving the family what it wanted. The House has wanted this Clause. I think we should end at one o'clock by thanking the Minister very much indeed for the most generous and sympathetic way in which she has met the request. This has been a political issue for a very long time but she has come to office and has settled it. Since it is so near one o'clock, I hope we will give the Minister the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Horace King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be dangerous if the Committee approved the Clause on the assumption that it had done very much for the voluntary schools. This is a very minor advantage to the voluntary schools, and I rise to point out that it still leaves the Catholic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1952-1953V000P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1283</span>
community and the Anglican community with a great burden. The simple fact is that there are hundreds of the worst schools in the country, with shocking buildings, run by either the Catholic Church or the Anglican Church. Both communities will have to make great sacrifices if they are to provide our children with the schools which are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the Catholic community is shaping to make that sacrifice. Its major problem will be to provide secondary schools for children in the Catholic schools. The Anglican community must be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary to bring these schools up to a decent condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Keenan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point which has emerged in the discussion concerns what is being paid towards the cost of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1284</span>
education. It has been suggested that 97 per cent. of the cost of the maintenance of Catholic schools is provided by the State, leaving only 3 per cent. to be provided by the Catholics. That might be so in the case of maintenance in some instances, but I would point to the fact that the Catholics must face very heavy capital commitments and the interest upon them, amounting altogether to much more than 3 per cent. Apparently this has escaped the attention of those who are not much in favour of assistance to voluntary schools. I have no axe to grind—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
