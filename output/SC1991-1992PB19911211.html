	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>CHARITIES BILL [H.L.]</div> <!-- bill -->
	<time>Wednesday, 11th December, 1991</time>

	<p>
	<b>The Committee met at ten o'clock.</b></p>

	<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>

	<p>Debate resumed on Clause 41.</p>

	<p>[
	<i>Amendment No. 52A not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 41 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a short point. As I understand it, the purpose of Clause 41 is to assist the trustees of small charities and make their administration both effective and efficient. The powers of trustees come under Sections 22 and 23 of the 1985 Act, subject to certain restrictions. As I understand it, the purpose of this clause is to tidy things up and make the application of the law wider and more uniform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trustees will still be required to act by unanimous resolution and with the commissioners' concurrence, and to give reasonable public notice of their intentions. I wonder whether the laudable purpose of the clause is not being defeated by subsection (1) (a), which states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"This section applies to a charity if … its gross income in its last financial year did not exceed £5,000".</p></blockquote>
I did not table an amendment because I did not wish to enter into competition with my noble friend Lord Ferrers, which seems rather vulgar—rather like a Dutch auction or some other auction—and I did not want to guess at the figure. However, I suggest that the figure of £5,000 is too small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being eminently reasonable—I hope my noble friend concurs with that point—I am asking him on bended knee whether he will be good enough to reconsider the figure. I suggest that the purpose of the clause—to help trustees of charities—would be better served if the low level of £5,000 were to be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual my noble friend is enormously persuasive. He did not actually produce any reason why the figure should be above £5,000 or whether he thought £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 would be better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously when one has a criteria such as this it is always possible to suggest another figure. I shall certainly reconsider the figure to see whether or not it is reasonable. My noble friend will realise that the provision applies to small charities. It could be argued that those with an income of £5,000 or so could be considered not entirely small, but once one goes up to £7,000 and £10,000 one is looking at much bigger figures. My noble friend will be aware also that the figure can be amended by order of the Secretary of State if it is considered to be too low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the points to which I attach some importance. When we are being invited to fix a figure it gives us little comfort to be told that someone of greater wisdom may subsequently
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
change it. We have an opportunity to change it now when my noble friend has available to him, without any difficulty at all, the collective wisdom of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to satisfy my noble friend. He says the figure is too low, and we say, "Yes, we have included a provision in the Bill to enable it to be increased". Then my noble friend, instead of saying, "I am so glad the Government are not being rigid", says, "No, we should alter it now".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend will be aware that when the matter was considered originally and the White Paper produced, the figure of £1,000 was suggested. Various representations were made so we upped the figure to £5,000. I shall certainly reconsider it to see whether or not it should be higher, but I cannot give my noble friend much hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 41 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 42 [
	<i>Small charities: power to spend capital</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 53:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 38, line 32, leave out ("for any useful purpose") and insert ("for a suitable and effective application").</p></blockquote>
The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 53 seeks to sharpen up the words, "for any useful purpose". It does not much alter the meaning, except that "for any useful purpose" to be achieved could be anything, whereas we want the application to be "suitable and effective" and related to the purposes of the charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not divide the Committee but my noble friend may agree that it would be sharper and nearer the truth to use the words "for a suitable and effective application" rather than "for any useful purpose".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is to help the trustees of some very small charities which have capital that by law cannot be spent, to put the whole of their charity's assets to better use. The clause will be of assistance where trustees hold an investment, other than land, which must be treated as a permanent capital endowment and which cannot itself be spent. Many older charities have their capital invested in ways which give them a low yield, so that in modern terms the income is small compared with the amount of capital invested to produce it. As the years go by the amount of real help that the income can give the charity's beneficiaries is eroded by inflation since the capital itself rarely grows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There comes a point where the trustees find themselves asking whether the amount of income they have available to spend each year is really achieving any useful purpose. In other words, is it actually relieving a need or is it merely a gesture? That is what the words, "any useful purpose" mean: is the money able to relieve any need? If it is not, the trustees will not be able to fulfil any of the purposes of the charity, since to give out benefits which, while they may be welcome to the persons receiving them, do not relieve any need would fail to fulfil the charity's purposes—not, of course, through any fault of the trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where that is the case, the trustees will be able to take advantage of Clause 42, provided that the charity's income is under £1,000 and that it has no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
land as part of its permanent capital endowment. They will be able to resolve to spend the capital as though it were income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the point raised by the noble Baroness and I can assure her that the clause already means what she is trying to make it mean. There is the additional element of the trustees' opinion. It is at their discretion that they decide whether any useful purpose is achieved by spending income alone, and they must make that judgment in accordance with the specific policies they adopted within the terms of the trusts, in their efforts to apply the charity's funds as best they can in fulfilment of the charity's purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. The wording may allow some of the small parochial charities for the poor to put the income to some purpose which does not help the poor. Surely it would be better for the wording to read "effective and suitable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can cite an example. I know of one small charity which was supposed to be for the relief of the poor. The trustees used the charity income to build a bench in the village on which anyone could sit: the wealthy also sat on it so it was not really for the poor. It was useful, but it was not suitable according to the original terms of the charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding of the subsection is that it does not enable the trustees to alter the trusts in any way whatever, except to allow them to use the capital for any purpose for which income is applicable. It is not a provision enabling trusts to be altered, but merely to enable capital to be expended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, is correct. The trustees must always use their assets for the purposes given in the trust deed. The use of the word "purposes" refers to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I briefly support the noble Baroness on this amendment. I am bound to say that it seemed to me that "for any useful purpose" means just that. The noble Viscount says that it does not, so I would be interested to hear the basis for it. On the face of it the phrase is too wide. The Government should look again to see whether the amendment has been drafted in an overwide fashion. Perhaps it could be tightened up in the way that the noble Baroness suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the phrase "for any useful purpose" must be within the purpose of the trust. I take the noble Lord's point. I believe that we are all trying to do the same thing. I shall be very happy to look again at the drafting of the clause. However, we believe that it means what we intend, although I certainly take the point made by the noble Baroness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the noble Viscount. He believes that the amendment means what it says, but many of us do not. I also believe that a great many of the public do not agree, either. The noble Viscount has been generous enough to say that he will look again at the amendment. In those circumstances I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>

	<p>[
	<i>Amendments Nos. 54 and 54A not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>Clause 42 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 43 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 44 [
	<i>Person acting as charity trustee while disqualified</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 54AA:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 41, line 39, at end insert ("(other than an exempt charity)").</p></blockquote>
The noble Viscount said: The commissioners do not have general jurisdiction over exempt charities and their trustees. The purpose of this amendment is to keep the trustees of exempt charities out of the commissioners' jurisdiction under Clause 44(4). As drafted, that clause will allow the commissioners to oblige a person who had acted while disqualified under Clause 43 as trustees of an exempt charity to repay sums of money to a charity from which he had received any expenses or remuneration in the course of acting as a trustee while disqualified. That would represent an unworkable extension of the commissioners' jurisdiction over exempt charities since the assets and property of exempt charities are not within the commissioners' jurisdiction. The commissioners are not permitted to inquire into the affairs of exempt charities under Section 6 of the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trustees of the exempt charity could take action themselves to recover the sums from the disqualified trustee or they could approach the Attorney-General to do so on their behalf. The withdrawal of the commissioners' confidence would not therefore leave the charity without remedy in the circumstances. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 44, as amended, agreed to.</p>

	<p>10.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 54AB: </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>After Clause 44, insert the following new clause:</p>

	<p>
	<i>("Limitation of liability of trustees</i></p>

	<p>
	<ol>

	<li>Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), the liability of any charity trustee or trustee for any charity, arising out of any obligation lawfully incurred as trustee, in aggregate with the liabilities of any other such trustees of that charity, shall be limited to the value of all assets of that charity.</li>

	<li>Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) hereof any charity trustee or trustee for any charity shall be entitled to be indemnified in respect of any claim against them arising out of any obligation incurred as trustee, out of any assets of the charity.</li>

	<li>Subsections (1) and (2) hereof shall only apply where —</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the conduct of the trustee was in all the circumstances giving rise to the liability reasonable; and</li>

	<li>the trustee had, at the time the liability arose, complied with all statutory requirements as registered charity.").</li></ol></ol></p>

	<p>The right reverend Prelate said: I am very glad to move the amendment in the name of my right reverend friend the Lord Bishop of London. I wish that the amendment had been in my own name because I believe that it is a very important amendment which will have much backing from all sides. The object of it is to encourage people to be trustees and to encourage them to be so without putting their entire assets at risk. Members of the Committee will know that at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
present time the trustees of a charity contract and deal as individuals and they are thereby personally liable without limitation. Where they are acting within the terms of the trust they are entitled in most cases to be indemnified out of the assets of the trust.</p>

	<p>However, if the assets of the trust that are available are insufficient the trustees are jointly and severally liable for any shortfall. This present unlimited liability is a real problem. Those who have the skills and resources to be trustees take advice as to whether or not to be trustees of a charity, but they are increasingly unwilling to do so. It would have been highly desirable to have many of those people as trustees of certain charities.</p>

	<p>It should be made clear that the purpose of the amendment is not to limit the liability of trustees where there are breaches of trust. The position as regards liability in those cases will remain unchanged by the amendment. I believe that noble Lords can easily imagine the kind of circumstances in which such liability can arise. For example, on proper advice trustees might enter into a building contract, but something goes wrong with the site or in some other way the contract is much more expensive than originally planned. The trustees are liable for any sum that the charity is unable to meet.</p>

	<p>It is particularly unrealistic today to expect day-by-day supervision from volunteer trustees who, by virtue of being trustees, often have quite a large number of staff working in the project for which they are responsible. Yet at the moment the trustees are liable for the faults of their staff to the whole extent of their personal assets. I could if I wanted to, but I do not intend to do so, refer to an incident of this kind in my own county which is tragic in its consequences. There are other community projects which involve not only the church. I am glad that I am speaking not only on behalf of the Church but on behalf of many different charities.</p>

	<p>The position can be further complicated because a number of the trustees are 
	<i>ex-officio.</i> They may be people of quite slight means. The purpose of the amendment is to remove doubt as to whether or not endowed assets of a charity are available to meet these liabilities.</p>

	<p>There is the question of the third party. The amendment says that the third party can only recover to the extent that a charity has assets. That is the position which the public would assume in any event to be the case. Many people would be unaware of the fact that if a charity has assets worth £20,000 and the cost of a building project is £50,000 then the poor trustees have to find £30,000. Is that fair to the third party? First, it is unlikely that any third party currently believes that he can claim anything other than the assets of the charity. Secondly, for the first time the financial position of a charity is publicly available including overdrafts, which in the past were not revealed. Banks are increasingly taking the view that an overdraft should be regarded as a liability of the trust that should be known.</p>

	<p>The provisions of the Bill provide that there should be a completely open approach to the assets and the liabilities of a trust. The amendment is intended
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
simply to offer some limitation to the liability of trustees where they have behaved properly and reasonably and met all their statutory requirements as a registered charity. I beg to move.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. At page 30 of the White Paper it is recognised that the company structure was not wholly appropriate to charities and suggests that there might be a need for a new corporate structure with limitation of liability. The point raised by the right reverend Prelate does not come as any surprise to the Government. As was pointed out, it would not limit the liability for breaches of trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that of striking the balance between the protection of charity trustees and the protection of members of the public. There is a risk of the balance going too far in the direction of placing the liabilities onto trustees. On previous amendments we have discussed the awful prospect opening up before trustees. There are already some signs of people refusing to take on that responsibility. Unless some change were made along the lines of the amendment there is an increasing risk of people refusing to act as trustees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too support the amendment. I know of some people who have refused to become trustees because they could not meet the financial commitment. Some of the trusts are losing good people because they are not prepared to take on the financial worries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a lawyer, I find that the amendment has tremendously interesting implications. Presumably it is not intended to cover criminal liability—that is a separate matter—and must therefore refer to civil liability. One wonders whether it is intended to refer to liability in contract only or whether it also applies to liability in tort. In the way that it is worded it looks as though it is intended to cover only innocent errors of judgment made within the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear what my noble friend the Minister has to say, but this is a branch of charity law which has so far been dealt with by the courts and not by statute. However, there is one exception to it being dealt with by statute, and that is to be found in Section 23 of the 1960 Act which gives power to the commissioners. It is a long section and I shall not read it all, but it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of this section, where it appears to the Commissioners that any action proposed or contemplated in the administration of a charity is expedient in the interests of the charity, they may by order sanction that action, whether or not it would otherwise be within the powers exercisable by the charity trustees in the administration of the charity; and anything done under the authority of such an order shall be deemed to be properly done in the exercise of those powers".</p></blockquote>
That limited degree of protection already exists in the 1960 Act. I remember that at the time we dealt with that Act a somewhat similar view was expressed. Of course, there were no right reverend Prelates in another place. I do not believe the view was expressed on behalf of the Church or religious charities. My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
recollection is that it was vaguely expressed by a Member of another place who had some experience of charity work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a big subject which needs thinking through, because it has great implications. I merely utter those rather vague words of caution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not seem to me that Section 23(1) of the 1960 Act meets the point. As I understand that subsection, it is directed towards authorising trustees to carry out some administrative action which might or might not be strictly within their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read it, the amendment is intended to give protection to trustees somewhat similar to the protection which company directors, for example, would have when they enter into a contract on behalf of the company. Directors would not be liable beyond the assets of the company. As I understand it, the suggestion here is that trustees who are acting fully within their powers should not be personally liable beyond the assets of the charity. With great respect to the noble Lord, I do not believe that Section 23(1) is of great assistance in this context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did say that it had limited application to the matter which arises here. I agree that at first sight it does not have a wide implication, but it undoubtedly has a limited one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. The last major contract of the charity for which I work was for well over £2 million for a building development. If we had had to rely upon trustees who were personally capable of settling that amount if anything went wrong we should have had an extremely short supply of trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the trustees have acted lawfully, and something has gone wrong that is outside their control—for instance, settlement occurring during the contract that had not been foreseen or was not foreseeable incurring considerable additional cost—the trustees should not be personally liable. The cost should come from the charity's funds. After all, the contractor can look at the charity's latest accounts and would be able to take up financial references for the charity as a contactor can do for any commercial operator. The amendment is worthy of support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may follow the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, on one point. One of the historical arguments that one has heard to justify the greater legal liability of the trustee, as opposed to the liability of a company director, has always been that in relation to a charity those dealing with the charity did not have access to its accounts or information about how it was going to be run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the objects of the Bill is to make more information about the charity available to the general public and those who might be dealing with it; and so, in a sense, the justification for maintaining that distinction between the liability of company directors and that of trustees of a charity has been considerably weakened. I see no reason why, in common sense, or,
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
indeed, in equity, a trustee of a charity should be personally liable for, in effect, innocent errors which might result in some loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Directors are not so liable, and I do not see why charitable trustees should be once the Bill is passed. I hope that the Minister can be forthcoming on this matter. It is clear from the mood of the Committee—if I may put it that way—that this is an issue which needs looking at carefully and fairly urgently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am the patron of a trust for raising funds for the completion of the cathedral at Portsmouth which was opened by the Queen Mother about a week ago. It required £3 million to be raised. When about £2 million had been raised the trustees faced the problem of deciding whether to go ahead and obtain contractors to the do the job. The problem was that the west wall would not survive. It was a crucial affair. The Bishop, the Provost and the chairman of the trustees, who happened to be a retired rear-admiral—I like to think that he was a courageous chap, being a personal friend—were courageous and went ahead with £1 million still to be raised. We are now at a stage where I think there was only about £200,000 yet to come. They were courageous but they needed some protection, which they did not have, as I see it. This is what I believe the right reverend Prelate is asking for on just those occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if the Government do not have an immediate answer they will take a sympathetic view of this. Had this kind of situation occurred after the Bill had become an Act and things had been tightened up, it is quite possible that we would not have got our cathedral finished because we would not have found trustees who would have risked it. It is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for rising a second time. It occurs to me that if the amendment is acceptable it might be better to limit it to charities which are registered. In the case of a registered charity, the other contracting party will be on notice that it is dealing with a charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right reverend Prelate has brought in an amendment which is extremely important and has far-reaching implications. I understand the anxiety which noble Lords have expressed about the situation. My noble friend Lord Renton said that this is a big subject and has interesting implications. He is right. I wonder whether I may put the Committee into the picture as we see it. To the extent to which charity trustees of non-incorporated charities can be exposed to personal liability in contract when acting for or on behalf of a charity is not straightforward. The general position is that trustees act in a personal capacity on behalf of the trust. But provided that they have acted properly, they are entitled to an indemnity out of the trust assets, either under Section 30(2) of the Trustees Act 1925 or under the general law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the indemnity is available, problems may arise where there is not enough income to meet the liability or where the only recourse is to the permanent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
endowment of the charity. In other words, one might have to sell the village hall in order to reimburse the trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems could also arise if the charity has insufficient assets to meet its liabilities. In those cases trustees may well be personally liable to third parties. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, said that there should be some form of limited liability. He said that the White Paper stated that the Government would explore this. We did so to see whether it was possible to obtain some form of incorporated body with limited liability. That has not been implemented because when we explored the possibility it proved difficult to fit such a form into the existing insolvency provisions relating to the Companies Act. It is also difficult to protect the rights of third parties. That is the reason why we did not incorporate that suggestion into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A universal right of indemnity could strengthen in certain cases the existence of a charity where its only property was its permanent endowment which was, for example, used for the purpose of the charity. An obvious example of that is an almshouse. The trustees concerned could sell the property in order to satisfy their indemnity and they could effectively thereby bring the charity to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present law, trustees could have recourse to the charity's permanent endowment in this way only by order of the commissioners or by order of the court and provided that it was in the interests of the charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One also has to consider the rights of contracting parties. My noble friend Lord Mottistone referred to Portsmouth Cathedral. He said it would cost £3 million and they had only £2 million. They were courageous and went ahead and did it. Perhaps they signed the contract for which they would have to spend £3 million even though they had only £2 million. I believe the contracting parties have a right and an interest in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right reverend Prelate's amendment would severely limit the ability of charities to enter into contracts. It seems to me it would adversely affect the position of third parties. Contracting parties simply may not be aware of the extent of the assets of the charity at the time of the contract and when any liability falls to be paid. They could avoid contracting with unincorporated bodies knowing that the trustees' liability will be limited to the assets of the charity but not knowing what the extent of those assets is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that charities are concerned about the question of the liabilities of trustees when they enter into contracts on behalf of the charity. For this reason the Charity Commissioners have recently considered the question of charities with trustees taking out insurance against liabilities. They have agreed that in appropriate cases it would be proper for insurance policies to be taken out to cover the trustees for personal liability for acts either properly undertaken in the administration of a charity or where they were undertaken in breach of trust by honest mistake. Such policies could in appropriate circumstances be taken out at the cost of the charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
Of course that form of insurance would not cover someone being wilfully negligent, and I do not believe anyone expects it to do so. However, it would protect the trustees from work which they had undertaken for which they were not personally liable. If one could give an example—it is always dangerous to do so—it might be decided to paint the village hall. The trustees know it would cost about £500, but when they start to do it they find it has dry rot and they have to remove the dry rot before they can paint it. The bill instead of being £500 comes to £2,000. That is the kind of situation where the difference would be able to be paid out of the funds of the charity. But if it meant the sale of a property which was the charity's assets or that the trustees would be personally liable for something they could not have foreseen it could be covered by insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is a difficult part of the law and many trustees are anxious not to be personally liable. However, if we were to go down the path of the right reverend Prelate it would create quite a lot of difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the noble Earl one question which I hope is fairly simple. After the passage of this Bill, why on earth should the position of trustees of a charity, however it is constituted, be different from the position of trustees of a charitable company? I do not see why, once we have gone through all the disclosure provisions in the Bill, if one is a trustee of a charity which is not incorporated one should be under the threat of enormous personal liability but if one is a trustee of a charity which is incorporated then one is covered by the protective provisions of the Companies Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before this Bill there may have been an argument, but after the Bill, for the life of me, I do not see what the distinction is in principle between the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a charity becomes an incorporated body and comes under the Companies Act it is subjected to a different regime. That is part of the point of being incorporated. It has certain advantages and disadvantages. Where a body is not incorporated, it acts by and with the approval and direction of the trustees. Somebody must be responsible and by the charity being unincorporated the trustees are responsible. It is the same as if one runs a firm and it is not a company: the owner of the firm is responsible for what is done. I believe that is the main reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Congleton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I have been a trustee of very small and medium-sized charities and remain one, and I suppose I should declare an interest. I wish to speak to the point about the deterrent effect that this surely may have upon bringing in new trustees. I had what has been referred to as an unhappy experience in this regard 10 or 15 years ago. It has left a scar. When I am invited to become the trustee of a new charity the first thing I ask is what my personal liability is likely to be. The Committee may think that is not a charitable attitude to take when being invited to become a trustee, but that is what will happen. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this Bill is designed to improve charity law, this amendment has an important place in it. I am not, of course, trying to make the situation worse for third parties. However, as I have already said, they have an opportunity of discovering both the assets and the liabilities of a charity before they enter into a contract. It is not always through an honest mistake on the part of the trustees that greater liability is incurred. That can be incurred through the incompetence of a third party. It can also be incurred through unforeseen circumstances on the part of both parties to a contract. It is in that kind of situation that I believe trustees need support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the general public will look to this Bill to achieve an improvement in this area. I can appreciate the importance of incorporation. I accept the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, as regards incorporation for registered charities. I appreciate also the value of insurance. All those matters relate to the kind of prudent behaviour that responsible trustees should exercise. However, there have been too many instances of unhappiness, and sometimes of tragedy, to treat this matter lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of incorporation of charities, I suggest that that is not necessarily a solution. I believe that the London medical schools, for example, are incorporated into one incorporating charity. That means that if one of the medical schools has an unfortunate experience the others all suffer. We should consider that aspect and consider ways of protecting people who are in that situation. This amendment stands in the name of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London. It is an extremely important amendment. I hope that the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, can give the Committee a real assurance that the amendment will be considered carefully. If that is not the case, I shall wish to press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right reverend Prelate has asked me whether I can give an assurance on this matter. I accept that it is an important matter. The Committee has expressed a great deal of concern about it. I shall certainly consider it. I cannot of course give an undertaking that the Government can introduce an amendment that will necessarily meet the requirements of the Committee. This is a complicated matter of law but in view of the fact that the Committee has shown such concern over it I am certainly prepared to reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yesterday I mentioned in a slightly frivolous fashion that the Committee was getting itself into some difficulty as regards the Government's statements of intent over the matters being discussed. This morning I believe one Member of the Committee has expressed support for the Government's position. That was the noble Lord, Lord Renton, who offered mild support and at least displayed his customary
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
openness of mind in considering the clause. I believe that everyone else who has spoken is unanimously in favour of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would far prefer a situation in which the Committee took a decision and if the Government decided they did not like that decision they would have Report stage in which to put the matter right. We are a Standing Committee and not a Committee of the whole House. I do not blame the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, for this situation. In his position I would act in exactly the same way. However, if the Government on being pressed hard on an issue, can only say that they will take the matter away and consider it but refuse to give an undertaking to do anything I must ask the rhetorical question: what on earth are we here for? As I understand it, the Committee stage of a Bill is designed to try to shape the Bill into a form that the Committee finds acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe the proper course of action on this matter is to take a decision on this amendment. If the Government do not like that decision they have all the facilities offered by later stages of the Bill to alter that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to answer that rhetorical question which, of course, does not require an answer. The noble Lord asked what we were here for. We are here, of course, to try to improve the Bill and make it as satisfactory as possible. The noble Lord shakes his head. No party politics are involved in this Bill at all. All we are concerned with is trying to improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On occasions I may say that I am prepared to take a matter away and consider it to see whether the Government can perhaps modify it. I make those comments in an attempt to be helpful. It is not a way of trying to avoid a Division. It is entirely up to the Committee if it wishes to vote on an issue. I was merely trying to be helpful to the right reverend Prelate. I have explained that I cannot accept his amendment but I would be prepared to consider the views that have been expressed. My comments were intended to be helpful. I was not attempting to waste the time of the Committee. However, it is for the Committee to decide whether to divide on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Lord Bishop of Worcester</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, for his response. He was helpful to me yesterday. I am not attempting to criticise the noble Earl. As a bishop I come into contact day by day with members of the public. As I have already said, I feel the public would like to see an improvement made in this area. As the noble Lord, Lord Richard, has said, if we vote in favour of this amendment the Government will still take the matter away for consideration but that Division might strengthen the noble Earl's hand in his consideration of this important amendment.

	<p>Resolved in the affirmative, and amendment agreed to accordingly.</p>

	<p>Clause 45 [
	<i>Minor and consequential amendments of 1960 Act</i>]:</p>

	<p>10.50 a.m.</p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 45 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had a communication from the National Federation of Housing Associations. Perhaps other Members of the Committee have received this as well. It is anxious that this point should be put to the Government at this stage in view of the fact that an amendment may be forthcoming later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is this. In spite of the exemption from the requirement, to register 250 industrial and provident societies which are housing associations have voluntarily registered in order to secure the benefits of public recognition as charities. More would probably have registered had it not been for a change of policy on the part of the Charity Commissioners in the early 1970s not to so register exempt charities. The commissioners are currently reviewing the register. Arising from that review they are, I understand, seeking to deregister those exempt charities which are voluntarily registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Federation of Housing Associations finds itself affected by this decision. I understand that it sympathises with the reasoning of the Charity Commissioners in this regard. Exempt charities are not subject to the supervisory functions of the commissioners. The commissioners feel that it is misleading the public for such charities to be so registered. On the other hand, the affected housing associations are seriously concerned at the potentially damaging effect on their work, especially on their fund-raising work, relating to the care and support of their tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the National Federation of Housing Associations has discussed this issue with the commissioners, who have, I am told, been most helpful. They have told the national federation that they are quite prepared for housing associations which are exempt charities to remain on the register provided
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
—it is a perfectly fair point—that if they do so the commissioners should have supervisory powers over those that remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely seek at this stage to put down a marker that at Report stage an amendment may be forthcoming which would remove from voluntarily registered exempt charities their exemption from supervision. It would be done, I suppose, by a new clause after Clause 45. That is why it seemed to me that this might be the appropriate stage at which to mention it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving the Committee notice of his concern. The charities to which he refers are exempt charities and they are not subject to the commissioners' jurisdiction. Therefore it is not appropriate for them to register. If a charity is exempt, it is exempt from the commissioners' jurisdiction and so it is exempt from the register. I wonder whether the organisations to which the noble Lord refers are seeking the benefits of registration without having to have the obligations of registration. If a charity is exempt it is removed from any of the obligations of the commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly true and it is precisely why the proposed amendment may seek to make those exempt charities that are registered subject to the supervisory powers of the commissioners. I do not think there is any attempt to evade those supervisory powers. It is merely a matter of certain exempt charities which want to remain registered being made subject to the commissioners' supervisory functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 45 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clauses 46 and 47 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 48 [
	<i>Contributions towards maintenance etc. of almshouses</i>]:</p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 48 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of the noble Viscount, Lord Mountgarret, I seek to oppose the Question on his behalf. I do not understand this clause. It provides that provisions in the trusts of almshouses for payments by residents of the almshouses of contributions towards the maintenance of the building shall cease to have effect if such contributions are approved or authorised by the commissioners. Is it the amount of the contribution that is no longer to be authorised, or does it mean that, where authorisation by the commissioners has taken place, those almshouses will no longer be able to gather from their tenants contributions towards maintenance? What is the position with regard to almshouses that have nothing in their trusts relating to the payment of a contribution by their tenants but have in fact been gathering a contribution from their tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are merely seeking here to remove from the Charity Commissioners the duty to approve the level of contributions imposed upon almshouse residents towards the cost of maintaining the almshouses and the essential services which go with them. The commissioners do not now set the level of contributions. They merely approve what the trustees
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
have said they intend. If we were to continue to require the commissioners' approval in these circumstances we would in effect be saying that almshouse trustees cannot be trusted to set sensible levels by themselves. What we are doing is saying the opposite. The setting of the level of contributions should be left to trustees. It should be left to them because they can be relied upon to act responsibly and because the level of contributions is an administrative decision in the running of the almshouse which is properly within the province of the trustees and not of the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level must be set with regard to the overall financial position of the charity and to the condition of the almshouse buildings. The trustees are clearly in the best position to judge what is best in this area. Almshouses which are registered as housing associations will still be subject to the power of the Housing Corporation to monitor and to supervise them. There will be no change to the basic concept of the almshouse charity or the status of residents. The purpose of this clause is to give the responsibility to the trustees, which is where the responsibility properly belongs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 49 [
	<i>Fees and other amounts payable to Commissioners</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 54B:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 42, line 31, leave out from ("prescribed") to end of line 34.</p></blockquote>
The noble Earl said: The words to be removed by this amendment specify that the functions for which the payment of fees to the commissioners may be required include the receipt by them of accounts or other documents. A number of people have expressed concern that charities should be made to pay the commission when fulfilling the requirement to submit accounts. It is not our intention that the charges to be made by the commissioners should cover the submission of accounts. We accordingly propose that the words which refer to submission of accounts be removed. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I view with some distress the disappearance of these words from the Bill. I thought it was a subtle way of introducing a statutory precedent whereby we would all be charged £10 for sending in our tax returns to the Inland Revenue. More seriously, I am surprised that these words were ever included in the Bill. It is such a remarkable and absurd provision that I think I ought to put on record my astonishment that it was ever in the Bill at all. I certainly do not object to the proposal that the words should be struck out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I misheard the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. I thought he said that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
was distressed by the amendment. It seems that he was distressed that the provision was included in the Bill. He is now distressed that it is being taken out. All I can say is that we have done this because we did not want to distress people more than is necessary by suggesting that they should do the very thing the noble Lord does not want them to do. That is why we have proposed the removal of these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can ask the Minister a question in regard to the amendment. The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill estimates that the revenue from the charges will be £300,000. That is presumably on the basis that charges for the enactments just deleted by the noble Earl will be included in the £300,000. If no charges are to be made by the commissioners for receiving accounts and other documents, perhaps the Minister can say by what sum the £300,000 will be reduced. It will obviously have an impact upon our approach to the rest of the proposed charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure of £300,000 does not include the submissions of accounts. It is an estimate—as it is bound to be—of what the commissioners are likely to receive from fees raised by registration, from schemes they introduce, from the sale of literature, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<i>Amendment No. 54C not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 49, as amended, shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

	<p>11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My contribution on this occasion will be slightly more serious than on the last occasion. Looking back I feel that I have been consistent in opposing the suggestion that charges should be introduced in the legislation. I am a little puzzled to know just what the Government have in mind in the clause as it stands. Much of it will be settled in the end by regulation, and we do not know what the contents of the regulations will be. But there are some mysterious factors involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Woodfield Report recommended a fairly extensive system of charging. The White Paper made an estimate that the charges would produce around £750,000. The note to the Bill says that the charges should produce £300,000. At Second Reading the noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw, asked the question just asked by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, on how the £300,000 will be made up. The noble Earl said that the best estimate was that it would be made up of perhaps 4,000 registrations at £50 each, another £80,000 from orders giving consent and £20,000 from the sale of leaflets. I asked whether the figure of £300,000 would be gross or net. I did not receive a specific answer but it is clear from the way the noble Earl put it that the figure is gross. Therefore, the cost of administration will have to be deducted from the £300,000.

Subsection (4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may impose charges of such amounts as they consider reasonable in respect of the supply of any publications produced by them".</p></blockquote>
If that means that the commissioners will issue leaflets to trustees without any request being made, and then charge for them, much of the £300,000 will soon disappear in the costs of the staff following up the thousands of charities which do not reply. The activities of the officers concerned will be better devoted looking at the returns that come in rather than chasing up those fiddling amounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must bear in mind that there is no financial advantage in registration. One does not acquire tax exemptions by the act of registration, as we know from our Scottish experience. The suggestion was made that the public may be charged for having access to the files, but that is surely the last thing one wants. Part of the object of the Bill is to encourage greater concern by the public and obtain greater help from them in disclosing things which may possibly have gone wrong. We do not want to discourage any attempt on the part of the commissioners to issue instructions to the trustees in the form of information leaflets. Part of the new regime into which we are entering is that more people should know about what is going on. Several of the provisions discussed were aimed at that specific purpose. It is also not to be forgotten that whatever remains of the £300,000—should there be anything left—does not go to the Charity Commissioners; it goes straight into the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by asking what it is that the Government hope to achieve by the clause. It cannot be a financial gain, even of £300,000, compared with the expenditure of the Charity Commission. We are told that £1.7 million is to be spent on a computer which is to handle the first stage of processing the returns that come in. When the cost of administration is deducted from the £300,000 the amount left is so trivial that it hardly justifies an elaborate bureaucratic structure of the kind contemplated by the clause. Is it designed to deter charities from applying for registration? I do not know. I am in a state of great puzzlement and at the moment I am not dissuaded from the view I have held fairly consistently that the idea of introducing tiny charges of this kind does not help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, speaking as he does as a former accounting officer of the Home Office. The imposition of trivial charges of this kind is not a wholly sensible idea. The amount will be eaten up by the costs of administration, by reminders and so on. The sums involved are pitifully small and I can see no case for proceeding in the way the matter is set out in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too support the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, and echo his unease regarding what lies beneath the whole of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, wondered aloud why such trivial sums are receiving the enormous impetus of a clause of this kind. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
wonder what the underlying principle is of why the Charity Commissioners must make the charges at all. As the noble Lord, Lord Allen said, and the noble Lord, Lord Harris, echoed, £300,000 is a small amount. It may be that behind the clause is what I might describe as the thick end of a wedge, which is an ideological wedge based on the principle that there is no free lunch for anybody at all, including the charities; that they must be compelled to charge for something; that we must try to think what that might be and that almost anything will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of £300,000, minus the administration charges and the collection charges, can hardly give any commercial benefit to anyone, and I shall be genuinely interested to learn what precedents or parallels the noble Earl can adduce for what is proposed and how he can justify whether the game is worth the candle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At Second Reading I questioned this issue as a matter of principle. From the point of view of those who are trying to raise funds from the public it is wrong that they should have an automatic administrative cost added to their expenses. Many people are reluctant to put money into charities unless they can be assured that it does not go towards their administration. But this is something that will be compulsory. I raised the matter with my noble friend and he kindly wrote to me about it because he was unable to answer the point at the time. He said that he sees nothing in principle against the measure. I challenge him on that because in principle there is something against it for the reasons given by other noble Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £300,000 is an underestimate. One can look at a much bigger figure. I am told that there are 170,000 registered charities, which represents under £2 per charity. There is the cost of supplying the charities with documents and policy papers, so that sum will soon be eaten up. I believe that the sum involved will be a great deal more than £300,000. Basically the sum is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am greatly supported by a charity of which I have not heard before. It is called MEND and its long title is Bringing the Mentally Dependent Home. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are a medium-sized charity operating professionally-staffed community care homes for mentally handicapped and chronically mentally ill adults".</p></blockquote>
For all the reasons that I and other noble Lords have given, that organisation particularly believes that this provision is a mean one which should not be included in the Bill. It will not benefit anyone very much. Either the Charity Commissioners are going to get a great deal of money which is more than is expected in the introduction to the Bill or they are not going to get very much, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord Harris. In that case, why do it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
I wonder about the wisdom of requiring people to pay for the privilege of performing a duty imposed on them by law. Subsection (4) of the clause states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may impose charges of such amounts as they consider reasonable in respect of the supply of any publications produced by them".</p></blockquote>
There are a number of publications which are in orbit today. The number is so vast and the publications are often so long that I do not believe that any official body should be encouraged to add to their number with the confidence that someone else will have to pay for them regardless of their merits or usefulness. I join that vast majority of people who credit successive administrations and the vast machine that they control with a general desire to do good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether those who frame such requirements take account of the huge irritation caused by activities which people outside that strange world regard as pure nit-picking. I resist the temptation to use words like "cudgelling", but I hope that my noble friend will give a little friendly message to his colleagues in the Government and those in his department who believe that any useful purpose will be served by this kind of requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be making heavy weather of this matter. It goes to show that everyone squeals whenever there is the possibility of someone being charged for something. On the whole, everyone prefers to get everything for nothing. That is a totally understandable principle. It is one that has been followed in this country for quite a long while. It has been considered appropriate to make charges in these cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, said that if the sums are to be so trivial the whole thing is absolutely unnecessary. If the sums are to be so large then there will be an outcry. If we put in our proposal that people should be made to pay large sums of money then your Lordships would scream and say that all the charities will be deeply affected and could not afford to pay. If a modest charge is made then your Lordships will say that it is not worth collecting. One cannot have it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put to the Committee the simile of a farmer who was asked what kind of harvest he had had. He said that if it had been any bigger he would not have got it into the barn but if it had been any less it would not have been worth gathering. One has to make a judgment on the matter. It has been said that £300,000 is not worth collecting. I have explained that we do not propose to charge for the submission of accounts but only for the registration of charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Charity Commissioners undertake work such as making schemes for a charity and doing what might be described as legal work, then they can charge for it. That is not unreasonable. Trustees are accustomed to paying for the services of solicitors, accountants, surveyors, fund-raisers and other professionals. If the Charity Commissioners do work of that nature it is not unreasonable to make a charge for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Peyton suggested that a cudgel should not be used. He said that he wondered whether the people who framed this kind of provision
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
realised the irritation which arose. There is nothing new in this provision. The Woodfield Report considered the question of charges by the Charity Commissioners. It was concluded that there was no reason why modest charges should not be made. The principle that the commission might charge fees was established as long ago as 1869. The people who framed that particular provision must have been, according to my noble friend's thinking, rather irritating. That measure was introduced in legislation in 1869. It authorised the making of a scale of fees for business done by the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle has been established for a long time but admittedly it has not been put into effect. As I said, it was established in 1869. One might say it was like a fixed Easter: an act has been passed for a fixed Easter but it has never been brought into operation. It is a modest charge. The other charges which are likely to be made are where leaflets are produced—leaflets concerning advice. The Charity Commissioners are unlikely to produce leaflets for which they do not believe there will be any commercial requirement. We are making heavy weather of this. The charges will not be insuperable. If they were, your Lordships would complain. They are modest charges and it is perfectly reasonable that the commissioners should have the right to make such a charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 49 is not quite so sinister as some Members of the Committee have said. As I understand it, the charges can only be made pursuant to regulations which have been laid before each House for affirmative resolution. Subsection (4) authorises the commissioners to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"impose charges of such amounts as they consider reasonable in respect of the supply of any publications".</p></blockquote>
I read that as not imposing any charges willy-nilly on trustees but only charging for any particular document and so forth that a trustee may require for his own purposes. There is nothing involuntary in subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a rather unfortunate phrase the Minister suggested that everyone squeals when there is a suggestion that charges should be imposed. The central question we face relates to the advice which will be transmitted to the trustees of many small and medium-sized charities by the body which has a statutory responsibility to provide that information. What Parliament did or did not do in 1869—I thought at one stage that he said 1689—is not relevant to this matter. We are imposing major new responsibilities on charity trustees. The Charity Commission has an obligation to make those trustees aware of the statutory provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that one of the arguments for introducing the provision is that the commission will not produce a leaflet unless there is a commercial case for it. What an extraordinary argument! The issue we are discussing is not whether there is a commercial case but whether the commission will make freely available to charity trustees information which in my view it has a responsibility to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe there is any sense in the clause. The real cost of administering the clause will be infinitely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
greater than £300,000 and I believe that in reality a loss will be incurred because of the flood of reminders and follow-up letters that will be needed in respect of relatively small sums of money. This is a profoundly mistaken clause. I understand why it exists, but I do not believe that it is a sensible way in which to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee can obviously have its own views about that matter. The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, suggested that I had said that the commission would only produce leaflets which had a commercial use. I was trying to imply that the Charity Commissioners would not provide leaflets which would not be required. They will not have to charge for every piece of advice. Where leaflets are given out which give general advice a charge can be made. There is nothing extraordinary about the clause. 
	<i>Hansard</i> makes a charge. If people want to buy a copy of 
	<i>Hansard</i> they can do so, even though it may be said to be a government publication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the money will go eventually to the Consolidated Fund, but the Government's funding of the Charity Commissioners has risen—if I remember correctly—from something like £6 million to £20 million. Therefore, I do not believe it is unreasonable that modest charges should be made for the work that the Charity Commissioners will be required to do. I do not believe that the clause will have the disastrous effect that the noble Lord, Lord Harris, suggests and that people will not go to the Charity Commission for advice. Advice will not be charged for. If people go to the Charity Commission they will receive their advice free. Where work is done, such as making schemes—after all, that is of a legal nature—I see no reason why there should not be a payment for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not make the statement which the Minister has just attributed to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the clause is taken out of the Bill—I shall vote to take it out—something should be put in its place. The Charity Commission is not a government department in the strict sense of the term; it is a statutory body. It may wish to provide services to the public related to its functions as a statutory body. In those circumstances the power to make charges, subject to the approval of Parliament, is not an unreasonable one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What needs also to be considered—probably in this context—is the ease, freedom and cheapness with which one can register a charity. Far too many charities are being registered. Anyone can think up a charity. They can gather around them a few people, form themselves into a group, and apply for registration as a charity. I have seen it happen under my very eyes. I have been asked to be a trustee of some of those charities. A good deal of expense is incurred by the Charity Commission. We must remember that every registered charity makes, or may be making, a claim upon the national revenue. Charities make a claim upon the Inland Revenue in connection with tax free deductions from pay, and such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
Concession after concession is made for charitable work. It is an enormous drain upon the revenue. We must be careful to ensure that we do not make it too easy to set up such activities. Not all those charities can be said to be rendering public benefit in any accepted sense of the term. Wider issues are raised as to the conditions of registration. I am not sure that we wish to tackle that issue in the Bill because it will obviously raise questions of what is a charitable purpose. I am in favour of leaving that topic severely alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to level charges for exceptional work that might be required of the Charity Commissioners is a reasonable one. What will the various elements of the charity lobby now be asking the Charity Commissioners to do in relation to research, the gathering of information about the nature of charitable purposes, and the amount of money spent in different directions? A branch of public administration should have some reserve power to ask for some payment if exceptional services are asked for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Denton of Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in favour of retaining the clause. I was nervous for many years about the fact that charities expected professionals to work for them and to make the charity a success, or to join as chief executives and so on, at a very low salary. There was an expectation that one would pay less for someone who was working for a charity. For a while, that prejudiced the success of some charities. I have seen that attitude change over the years. It is now recognised that charities need professionals and they need to be rewarded with a fair wage. That argument applies to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Charges will not be made for things which have no value. I am sure that it is not envisaged that charges will be made for publicity that is generated without being needed. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, understands my Yorkshire background which makes me say that people do not always value that for which they do not pay. People recognise that costs are involved if something has to be done. Therefore, I should like to see the clause stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am left in some dilemma over this matter. I accept that there is a case for charging for making orders and such things. I am still unhappy about the wide-ranging powers taken in the clause. I am afraid that I viewed the affirmative resolution to which my noble and learned friend referred as being a rather poor defence, as I understand that it is a tradition in this place never to vote against an affirmative resolution. I am sorry, I believe that has happened once, but I would not exaggerate its importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) is ambiguous. My noble and learned friend is much more likely to be right about its interpretation than I am, but, if he is, it makes the position rather worse because it would then mean that charges would be made for leaflets which would be expected to be paid by those trustees who are most in need of advice and instruction and who would be least likely to cough up the money for the leaflet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Earl said that we are making heavy weather of the clause but it is quite important. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
are questions of principle, as the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, said, on which differing views can be held, but it is arguable that the public who contribute to charity are not really expecting that they will be contributing £300,000 or whatever it is to the costs of the Charity Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps even more important in the light of my experience are the administrative consequences. The noble Earl did not deal with these in any detail. I do not know how much they will come out at but it will not leave very much change out of the £300,000, if any.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems odd to draw on the experience in such a strange body as the Gaming Board, but I was chairman of that body for some years. We had a system of charging fees for licences, certificates and suchlike and the bureaucratic structure that had to be built up to winkle out the money from all those concerned makes me feel that this project is administratively pretty well a nightmare. If I was still accounting officer, as the noble Lord has reminded me, and was responsible, I would think a long time before setting up a new structure to deal with trivial amounts when the result of it all in receipts would be hardly noticeable compared with the total expenditure of the Charity Commission. I feel that it is a mistake to go ahead in precisely the way this clause envisages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may feel that I ought to move for its deletion in the expectation—and I would not object to this—of the Government coming back at Report with some more modest proposals to charge for specific purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord said that I did not answer one question, for which I apologise. It was about the costs of collection. One cannot tell in advance what the cost of collection will be. If charities pay up reasonably quickly, the costs will be trivial. There will be a certain amount of modest bookkeeping to be done, but in our view that would still leave a figure of about £300,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged for that explanation. But I must in all honesty say that I find it difficult to reconcile with what the noble Earl said on Second Reading, where he made up the £300,000 from the 4,000 registrations at £50 each, £80,000 from orders giving consents and £20,000 from the sale of leaflets. That seems to add up to the £300,000 without any allowance for administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am speaking from actual experience. I have operated something of this kind. People do not reply promptly. One has to remind them; and build up quite an elaborate structure. In conclusion, what is left to go to the Exchequer is so trivial that it would be a mistake for us to set this up—to authorise this bureaucratic structure which the clause envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Resolved in the negative, and clause, as amended, disagreed to accordingly.</p>

	<p>11.37 a.m.</p>

	<p>Clauses 50 and 51 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 52 [
	<i>Supply of false or misleading information to Commissioners, etc.</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 55:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 45, line 1, leave out ("knowingly or recklessly") and insert ("dishonestly").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 55 I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 56. After our last contentious debate, this is a simple proposal which I hope will make stronger and clearer the situation at the beginning of Clause 52. Several Members of the Committee have in the past few days spoken powerfully in favour of the word "knowingly". I have been one, as has my noble friend Lord Richard. Here it is again in Clause 52, and I now seem to be asking for something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context "dishonestly" is the simpler, clearer and more powerful word. In the case of Amendment No. 56, I suggest that one cannot wilfully suppress something without in the process being dishonest. Therefore "dishonest", being the stronger word, it is to be preferred. In both these cases one must remember that imprisonment can follow conviction under the provision. Therefore dishonesty should be the key test as to whether the provisions of the clause bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That same consideration applies even more to subsection (2) which covers anyone actually altering documents. It is a simple amendment designed to strengthen the powers of the Bill. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Denton of Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may comment in particular on Amendment No. 55. I have heard constant criticism in this Committee that the Government do not understand small charities. However, this indicates that there is some understanding of small charities. The word "recklessly" is important because we are dealing with a situation where almost everyone working in charities would never in a million years be dishonest. That is not what we are considering. We are looking at people who are probably less well informed than, say, the noble Lord, Lord Congleton—people who do not fully understand
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
the responsibilities they take on when giving their commitment to charity. By leaving the word "recklessly" in, we may get through to these people that it is no good saying, "I let this information go forward because I was too busy", "I let it go because I couldn't get hold of the person who had it" or "I thought I was doing the best thing".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the danger that has been raised that there may be a shortage of trustees after this Bill has gone through. But I prefer to say "recklessly" as it reflects what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Hilton of Eggardon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am diffident in expressing an opinion on legal definitions in the presence of noble and learned Lords. However I believe the word "reckless" has produced difficulties in legal definitions. My memory of stated cases is that that term has constituted a particularly knotty problem for lawyers. The word "reckless" has not proved successful in relation to driving offences. The term "reckless driving" has been constantly altered. Therefore, I believe the word "reckless" poses dangers although in common parlance people think they understand what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a legal definition of a crime it might present difficulties. I also believe that the word "wilfully" in subsection (2) of Clause 52 might pose difficulties as regards destroying documents. People frequently wilfully destroy documents without any dishonest intent thinking they are no longer required. The word "wilfully" poses particular difficulties as regards people who may think they are simply clearing out an office and who may inadvertently throw away a document, thereby quite wilfully destroying it, but who have not acted dishonestly in any way. I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I must disabuse my noble friend Lady Denton. She claimed there were no dishonest people working for charities. I have come across cases of dishonest people working for charities. Those cases may be rare but occasionally they happen. The suggestion of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, that the word "dishonestly" be added to the Bill rather than take the other words out, is a good suggestion. However, I am no legal brain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question for the noble Baroness, Lady Denton. the problem I have with her comments is that this part of the Bill imposes a criminal penalty. I cannot believe that anyone here would wish to see a situation in which a charity trustee who has only been reckless may be sent to prison. Clause 52(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable … on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years".</p></blockquote>
The potential penalty here is out of all proportion to the offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Denton of Wakefield</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say to my noble friend Lord Swinfen that I remarked that the

majority of people working for charities would never be dishonest. I am not so naive as not to recognise that charities are at risk in this matter. Over the past few mornings I have absorbed information about charities. I have also recognised that the approach of noble and learned Lords to this matter differs from the approach of the so-called laymen. I would call myself very much a laywoman in this Committee. I understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Richard, as regards a criminal penalty. However, we must get the point across that trustees must be responsible for their actions. That is an important message.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, wishes to make it clear that only persons who are acting with dishonest intent should be guilty of an offence. It is certainly not our intention that the inadvertent provision of false information, or the accidental suppression of documents, should constitute an offence. That is the purpose of applying a test of knowledge or recklessness, in the case of provision of information, and wilfulness in the case of concealment of documents. It is not in our view appropriate to import the necessity that the action be taken dishonestly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dishonesty as a test is generally used in the context of offences of theft or fraud. It is difficult to see what it could mean in the context of these offences. The test of intention will be narrowly construed and if it is necessary for the prosecution to prove a dishonest intention it may well be that the provision would have little effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dishonesty suggests an element of financial gain which is not necessarily a motive in the offence of providing false information to the Charity Commissioners. The sole motive may be to conceal failure to comply with the requirements imposed by the Bill or the 1960 Act. The noble Baroness, Lady Hilton of Eggardon, said that the use of the word "recklessly" had posed difficulties in practice. She referred to the offence of reckless driving. I understand that the use of the word "recklessly" in the context of giving information has not posed difficulties and has been well precedented. The term "wilfully" is only another way of expressing "intentionally".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my explanation satisfies all the points that have been made. I also hope I have explained why we think it is important to retain the words "knowingly or recklessly" in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Alas, that explanation does not satisfy my lay mind. No one could be more lay in these matters than I. I am still concerned about this matter. It is a serious point and I am not speaking frivolously. As my noble friend Lord Richard said, there are severe penalties upon conviction. I hope the noble Viscount can explain more clearly what the term "knowingly or recklessly" implies which the word "dishonestly" does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only person who may be described as more of a lay person than the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, is possibly myself.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
However with that huge burden of disadvantage I shall try to clarify this matter. The inclusion of the word "dishonestly" means one has to prove there was a dishonest intention. A dishonest intention implies personal gain. That is not necessarily the same matter that is covered by the term "knowingly or recklessly" when it comes to the matter of providing the Charity Commissioners with information. Clause 52(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person who knowingly or recklessly provides the Commissioners with information which is false or misleading in a material particular shall be guilty of an offence".</p></blockquote>
That is the point I am trying to make. The word "dishonestly" as regards providing information does not refer to the same matter as the one I have just mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to confess that I am not myself skilled in the criminal law, never having practised in it. However, I believe there is some difficulty in substituting the word "dishonestly" for the term "knowingly or recklessly" or for "wilfully". I believe I am right in saying that "dishonestly" is normally used in a statute which deals—as the noble Viscount said—with theft and similar offences where there is some gain to the criminal. I do not think the word is totally appropriate in this context. Speaking for myself, in ignorance, I would prefer the term "knowingly or recklessly".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I may presume to say that I have had a lot of experience in the criminal law in prosecuting, defending and sitting judicially as a recorder and as a relief judge at the Old Bailey. I venture to say I entirely agree with what the noble and learned Lord has just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, and my noble friend Lord Renton. They have a far greater knowledge of these matters than I. I welcome their support and I believe their comments are correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the word "dishonestly" is not necessarily the most felicitous term to use. It does not deal with the evil which we perceive in the clause as presently drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Viscount said that it is not intended to make a criminal offence where someone accidentally does something which is caught by the subsection. Subsection (2) provides that any person who wilfully destroys any document, no matter what his intent, which he is liable to be required to produce to the commissioners shall be guilty of an offence. The accidental destruction of a document 
	<i>prima facie</i> is a criminal offence if it is done wilfully. All one has to do is wilfully intend to destroy the document. One may think that the document does not matter, but as I read the subsection that would not be a defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Wilfully" is only another way of saying "intentionally". That is what wilfully means. Therefore it does not mean accidentally or anything of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless we are careful there will be a slightly arcane argument in a moment as to what "intent" means in the criminal law. If I destroy a
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
document intending to destroy it I am destroying it intentionally. The fact that I may be destroying a document that I do not think I have to produce to the commission when in fact I do have to produce it to the commission does not go to the intent with which I destroy it. That, as I understand it, is a pretty well recognised part of our law, in the criminal courts at any rate. To make that a criminal offence subject to imprisonment seems to be taking rather a massive sledgehammer to crack a very small nut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If "dishonestly" is not the right word, perhaps one ought to try to think again of what word one should use to mean that the intent to avoid sending the document to the commissioners has to be somewhere written into the clause before it becomes an offence. That is the point. I am not wedded to the word "dishonestly". It was a fairly simple proposition which most people could understand. However, if it causes difficulty of interpretation, so be it. The central point is that intentionally destroying a document, even if one does not know that the document is a document that one is required to send to the commissioners, is an offence for which one can be sent to prison. That cannot be right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I said "intentionally" that made the noble Lord, Lord Richard, go off in a direction which was not necessarily right. If one does something wilfully one cannot do it accidentally. That is the important point and that is what matters. It cannot be accidental if one does something wilfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the noble Lord's attention to Section 6(9) of the Charities Act 1960. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any person wilfully alters, suppresses, conceals or destroys any document which he may be required to produce under this section, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine".</p></blockquote>
The words in Clause 52 are not new. They appear in the 1960 Act. To have done something accidentally is always a defence. To do something by accident is not wilful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These words have each been used in appropriate contexts in previous statutes. But that is not all. They are each words which have been considered by the Court of Appeal from time to time. The circumstances in which the Government suggest they should be used seem to be consistent with previous decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are having a feast over this point which I had not really intended. I wish only to add what seems to me as a former student of the language a fairly obvious point. "Wilfully" surely means with the consent of the will—intending to do something, being in your right mind and having that as your object. Wilfully to destroy or alter a document may not in itself be a criminal thing to do, yet it stands to imprison the person convicted of it. I do not think we need go into this too deeply. I should be delighted to have a discussion about the metaphysics of language with the noble Viscount at any point but not at this point. Having made the point that we need to look again—perhaps at a later stage—at the precise wording of this clause, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[Lord Morris of Castle Morris]</p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>[
	<i>Amendment No. 56 not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>Clause 52 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 53 [
	<i>Restriction on institution of proceedings for certain offences</i>]:</p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 53 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It so happens that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, had given notice of his intention to oppose the Question that Clause 53 shall stand part of the Bill. If he had not done so, I would have done so. I do not understand why there should be no prosecutions for most of the offences, including some quite minor ones, under the Bill without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee's attention to what those offences are. The offence in paragraph (a) amounts to failure to register a charity. Paragraph (b) deals with stop orders on banks and other financial institutions. Paragraph (c) deals with failure to publish reports and accounts. Paragraph (d) deals with acting as a trustee while disqualified. Paragraph (e) deals with giving wrong information to commissioners. In Clause 73 of the Bill we find very strangely indeed that, although that is a clause relating to offences by bodies corporate, for an offence under that clause the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions is not necessary. I think that the Government should consider this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases the Charity Commission itself will prosecute. It will have power to prosecute when it likes. But it should not have to ask permission of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is most unusual for one government department, or one public body, to have to ask permission of another public body, especially as both the Charity Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions are not quangos. They are under the direct responsibility of Ministers of the Crown. If we place this burden on the Director of Public Prosecutions he will have to have a well-qualified lawyer, experienced in charity law, appointed to his office to advise him on these cases. That will involve further public expenditure. I do not think there is any mention in the Financial Memorandum of that increase in public expenditure. This clause is not only over-zealous but is wrong in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for this clause is simply that those who administer charities are usually unpaid volunteers. They give their time, their effort and their good will. Charities can range from national bodies with a large turnover to quite small parochial charities. Their trustees have in common one thing—their willingness to give up their time in the interests of serving the particular beneficiaries of their charity. Prosecution of offences under Part I of the Bill should not therefore be undertaken lightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course these criminal offences are necessary but it is equally important that we should put in place machinery to ensure that the offences are prosecuted only where the transgression is a serious one and
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
where it is really warranted in all the circumstances. It is for this reason that the Bill prevents a criminal prosecution under Part I of the Bill except if it is by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. In other words, he will be a sieve to ensure that no frivolous actions are taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases will be identified by the commissioners in the course of their work, and where they consider a prosecution both necessary and desirable they will refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service, either directly or through the police if that is appropriate in the circumstance of the case. That is not an unreasonable step to take. I think that it is an excellent precaution against the anxieties which some Members of the Committee have expressed that there are too many onerous responsibilities upon trustees. Of course there must be onerous responsibilities. But they should be charged with a criminal offence only if somebody in the nature of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is an independent person, thinks it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The commissioners are a responsible body. As my noble friend said, they will be actually or potentially involved in every single case which may arise. It will enough for the commissioners, who have the statutory responsibility for administering this branch of the law, to be the body to decide whether or not prosecution would be proper. To drag the Director of Public Prosecutions into the matter as well, and in effect in some cases to give him a veto over the commissioners, is utterly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be grateful to other noble Lords who express their views on the matter—I do not want to press the amendment in isolation. It seems to me to be a clear case for allowing the commissioners, who are given so much responsibility under the Bill, to exercise that responsibility on their own behalf and not to make it necessary for them to resort to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who will need to employ a small staff to deal with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Renton, was good enough to invite others to speak and I accept his invitation. I fear that I do not agree with him, but I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it appears to me that the number of such cases will be small. I hope that will be the situation and I am sure that that is the expectation of most of us. I therefore do not believe that there is a realistic prospect of the director needing to employ even a small army of lawyers to deal with prosecutions in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given all the problems already discussed during the Committee stage of the Bill, and the risks to which many volunteer trustees expose themselves as a result of becoming trustees in the first instance, it is right that there should not be a prosecution without the consent of the DPP. That is my view and I accept the arguments put forward by the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Like the noble Lord, Lord Harris, I believe that there will be only a few cases but it is important that there should be this reassurance, as my noble friend the Minister said there will be.

	<i>Directions of the Commissioners</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 57:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 46, line 38, leave out second ("of").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I am happy to move an amendment which I believe will be acceptable to the Government. It is designed to correct a misprint in the Bill. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always prepared to listen to good and sound arguments. The noble Lord, Lord Allen, was extraordinarily brief in his speech. I can only assume that the brevity of his speech goes with the conviction of his argument. Therefore, when his speeches are longer perhaps his conviction is not as great. It is an important amendment and I am happy to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>On Question, amendment agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 55, as amended, agreed to.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 57A: </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>After Clause 55, insert the following new clause:</p>

	<p>
	<i>Relief for small charities</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>(".The Commissioners may direct that any provision of the 1960 Act or of this Part of this Act shall not apply to any charity if they consider that its application would impose a disproportionate burden on such charity.").</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>The noble Lord said: My name appears on Amendment No. 57A together with that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon, and the noble Lord, Lord Harris.</p>

	<p>The clause is fairly self-explanatory. It says that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners may direct"—</p></blockquote>
making it a matter clearly for the discretion of the commissioners—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that any provision of the 1960 Act…shall not apply to any charity if they consider that its application would impose a disproportionate burden on such charity".</p></blockquote>
We are legislating in respect of a vast mass of charities in this country and obviously many will not be affected by the exercise of the commissioner's discretion in this form. On the other hand, it would be worth having some residual discretion in the charity commissioners to enable them to relieve a specific charity with a specific difficulty of some of the obligations under which the charity may be working in relation to the rest of the Act. It would be worth having that residual power incorporated into the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>

	<p>Of course there will be no obligation on the Charity Commissioners to act. There will merely be a discretion to remove some of the burdens on any specific charity if they considered them to be disproportionate. It is an additional protection that can be written into the Bill at no great cost to its structure or to the rest of its provisions. It will provide an additional safeguard for the smallest charities and for the complicated rural domestic charities which may perhaps find themselves placed under a disproportionate burden by the rest of the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Richard, says that the amendment will help small charities which have disproportionate burdens placed upon them. In fact, it will have a sweeping effect. It will enable the commissioners to direct that any of the provisions of either the 1960 Act or Part I of the Bill shall not apply to any charity if that charity, in the commissioners' opinion, suffered a disproportionate burden in complying with the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not certain what a disproportionate burden is. I am sure that the Bill and the 1960 Act contain provisions which cannot be said to cause any burden to a charity. Of course, there are other provisions which may cause a burden, particularly to charities which are maladministered. Indeed, the provisions exist to do just that; to place a burden upon them. It is right that they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trustees of some charities may find it a burden to keep proper accounts even though the regime we have created is not unduly onerous. Keeping proper accounts is a proper and necessary duty and I would not wish to see charities relieved of it, yet that would be the case if the noble Lord's amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tried not to place on trustees any duties or responsibilities which it is not right that they should shoulder. Where the provisions of the Bill may place an administrative burden on small charities we have specifically provided for the burden to be mitigated. For example, charities which do not have an income in excess of £1,000 a year do not have to register or submit their reports. Charities with an income which does not exceed £10,000 can prepare a simplified set of accounts. Charities with an income which does not exceed £100,000 may have their accounts examined by an independent person. The commissioners have the power to dispense with the need to make an annual return in the case of any specific charity or class of charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone a long way to accommodate small charities. If the noble Lord's amendment were incorporated into the Bill it would give the commissioners power to remove any of the requirements of Part I from any charity where they thought fit. I really think that that would be unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find these amendments a little surprising, particularly coming from the noble Lord, for whose opinions we all have such regard. I greatly respect the Charity Commission. It has great wisdom and experience in these matters. For the life of

	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
me I cannot believe that it would welcome being put into a position where it could dispense with the law in any particular case. I cannot think of any precedent for such a suggestion. I have no hesitation in supporting the Government in resisting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too am filled with admiration for the noble Lord, Lord Richard. On this occasion I find myself in agreement. The fact of the matter is that the discretion is being given to the commissioners. The implication of what the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, said is that the commissioners would behave unreasonably or capriciously. I cannot see any evidence for holding that belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to give the commission authority to take the formal action which it can under the proposed new clause, in some cases it would no doubt be helpful to the commission itself. There are not any huge risks attendant on that. We are giving a discretion to a public body which is responsible to Ministers for carrying out its responsibilities. If the commission formed the view that it was unattracted by this approach, it simply does not have to apply the provision. In the circumstances I do not think that the fears of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, and the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, are justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the amendment slightly surprising. A little earlier the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, said that he did not like what was in the Bill being altered by affirmative resolution of the Houses of Parliament. He said that it was almost impossible to vote against such a resolution. There is provision in the Bill in a number of instances where matters can be altered by an affirmative resolution of both Houses. This measure is giving the Charity Commissioners the power not to operate the whole of Part I of the Act. It does not require either the affirmative or the negative resolution by the Houses of Parliament. The Charity Commissioners can simply say that they dispense with that part of the law where they think fit. That is not right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The circumstances are set out in the clause. They are where,
	<br><blockquote><p>"its application would impose a disproportionate burden on such charity".</p></blockquote>
One cannot simply say that Clause 52 will not be operated. The case of a particular charity will have to be considered. It will have to be decided as regards that charity whether the commissioners will exercise their discretion in the way set out in the clause. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, takes the view that somehow or other that is inconsistent with what we on this side of the Committee have been trying to establish in the past four or five days. One forgets how long we have been sitting here, for any good that we have been doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall bear the strictures of the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, with as much fortitude as I can muster. I hope on the next occasion that he will yet see the force of some of my arguments. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 56 [
	<i>Interpretation of Part II</i>]:</p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 58:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 47, line 16, after ("charitable") insert ("or kindred").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The amendment does not raise any great question of principle but it is a little bothering. In the Charities Act 1960 there is a definition of "charitable purposes". It states that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"'charitable purposes' means purposes which are exclusively charitable according to the law of England and Wales".</p></blockquote>
Presumably that applies to Part I of the Bill. As regards Part III of the Bill and Clause 70(4), there is a provision that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"in this section 'charity' and 'charitable purposes' have the same meaning as in the Charities Act 1960".</p></blockquote>
In Part II of the Bill we have a definition of "charitable purposes" which is quite different from that contained in the 1960 Act. It is not a very happy situation that in the same Act of Parliament we should have the same phrase defined in different ways. In Part II the phrase appears several times, which involves the army of consequential amendments to which my name is attached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all wedded to the suggestion that I have made in the amendment as a way of differentiating the definition of "charitable purposes" in Part II of the Bill from the rest of the legislation. I would be quite happy to accept any preferable way of doing it. There is something to be said, when we talk about "charitable purposes" in Part II of the Bill, for using words which make it clear that this is something different from "charitable purposes" as defined in the Charities Act 1960, which is so familiar to all of us who are concerned with this kind of activity. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support these amendments. It is a little odd to have the same expression with different meanings in different parts of an Act. One has only to say that to clinch the argument. We cannot debate the matter at any great length. The situation is rather unhappy because of the present wording. I suggest that the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Allen, is a good one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I saw the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Allen, I put a wet towel around my head, as it were, in order to try to understand the niceties and difficulties between Parts I, II and III of the Bill. We have tried to make it clear that the definitions contained in both Parts II and III and the references to a "charitable institution" or "charitable purposes" included "benevolent or philanthropic purposes". That is what we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having defined what we meant we thought that it was a convenient shorthand way of dealing with the matter simply to refer to "charitable" thereafter. The Bill would be considerably longer and more comprehensive if we had to spell the matter out each time. I recognise that there is a problem here and I shall take the amendment away to see whether the position can be clarified. It is quite simple to clarify it, but it would make the Bill considerably longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>(", trustee or a volunteer (receiving expenses or nominal honorarium) of such an institution acting in his capacity as such;

	<br><blockquote><p>"promotional venture" means any advertising or sales campaign or any other venture undertaken for promotional purposes; that includes direct solicitation or representation on the part of the professional fund-raiser, fund-raising professional or commercial participator to potential donors.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 73 and 79 which are consequential. The purpose of the amendment is to seek to find an appropriate balance between those fund-raising activities undertaken by outside agents which should come under regulation and those which quite properly should not. The amendment includes an explicit derogation for volunteers. It was accepted by my noble friend the Minister at Second Reading that volunteers should not be subject to these regulations. The inclusion of that provision in the amendment makes that point explicitly. The amendment also provides an additional derogation for the associated trading companies of charities. It is a requirement at law, quite properly, that charities' trading activities should be undertaken outside the charitable body, thus protecting the charity's assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue and other government bodies recognise that that is good practice and that where charities undertake trading through those companies, and the proceedings of that trading are donated to charity, the trading company itself should be regarded in all senses at law as the charity itself. If not given that derogation, charities and their associated trading companies will face enormous additional administrative and bureaucratic burdens. In some cases, especially in smaller charities where the volume of trading is low but of great importance in terms of income to the charity, the additional burdens will undoubtedly lead to a halt in otherwise effective and controlled fund-raising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A "promotional venture" is also included in the amendment. It was generally accepted on Second Reading that Clause 56 was appropriate in its intentions but that the current drafting was too broad. In seeking to regulate instances of fund-raising abuse, which I agree should be halted by the regulation, the general definitions currently contained in the clause will also affect wholly legitimate fund-raising activities currently undertaken on behalf of charities by third
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
parties who are acting appropriately, legitimately and within the control of the charity and/or the donor. The latter point is the crux of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should seek to regulate further only where other clauses do not provide adequate control over the fund-raising process by the charity with which the fund-raiser is working, or the donor where an appeal is made direct to the public for general charitable purposes. Consequently, I do not seek to amend the definitions of "commercial participator", "fundraising business" and "professional fund-raiser" except in respect of the increased derogation for the latter, because where their activities are not subject to control by the donor or a charity they should be regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am seeking to amend the precise nature of the type of activities undertaken so as to regulate those activities where control is not present but not to regulate where it exists. That, I believe, creates an appropriate balance between regulation and sound common sense. For example, joint promotions making direct appeals to the general public for charitable donations will be regulated; sponsorship by commercial organisations for theatrical or similar events will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the wording of the amendment needs to be improved as the Bill goes through because there is more than one method by which a charitable company can pass its profits through to the parent charity. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment to which my name is also given. As I said on Second Reading, I am advised principally by the NSPCC on whose central executive committee I have the honour to serve. It has picked out two amendments, of which this is one, which it believes to be fundamental. The other is not being taken today, and I shall make my point when we reach it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to what can be loosely termed as the volunteer movement. It is almost impossible to say how many volunteers there are in this country because their numbers fluctuate considerably. In times of national or international disaster, many members of the public happily turn themselves into volunteer fund-raisers for a short period. That covers circumstances, for example, such as school children collecting money to relieve famine in Ethiopia or individuals putting round the bucket to raise money to assist the families of those killed or injured in national disasters such as occurred at the Hillsborough Football Stadium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other people have a more committed approach and devote themselves to raising funds for one or two charities on a sustained or long-term basis. Many Members of the Committee would fall into that category. It is typical, for example, of individuals who are NSPCC branch members. In 1990, the NSPCC had 222 branches involving 10,000 people who raised £9.5 million per annum. In both cases, volunteers are an important element of the charitable sector. Their efforts raise considerable sums of money. In the NSPCC, volunteers raise 30 per cent. of the total funds available to help vulnerable children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
It should be stressed that the volunteer movement is important for other reasons. Becoming a volunteer is one way in which individuals can assist their communities and express their commitment to their fellow citizens. That ideal was recognised in, for example, the Citizen's Charter, and the Government's commitment to assisting the developing volunteer movement in eastern Europe, as announced by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in his speech to the Charities Aid Foundation on 5th November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Volunteers are important to the charitable sector. The drafting of Clause 56 threatens to change their status, creating uncertainty and a possible disincentive to becoming a volunteer fund-raiser. Clause 56 as drafted could include volunteers as professional fund-raisers, especially if they receive expenses or a small honorarium from the charity involved. That is a common practice. Expenses are paid to cover small sums of money for postage, the telephone or petrol spent by the individual in the course of volunteer fund-raising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I gained the impression that my noble friend the Minister did not intend to catch volunteer fund-raisers and might be sympathetic to amendments such as this. Like my noble friend Lord Swinfen, I believe that the drafting could be improved. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will tell us that he likes the idea of the amendment and will perhaps come back with an amendment along these lines on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support the amendment and in particular that part of it which refers to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a wholly owned trading subsidiary of a charitable institution where the entire net proceeds of that subsidiary are covenanted back to the charitable institution".</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, at present such a subsidiary merely makes a statement that its profits are covenanted and will be given wholly to the charity which owns and controls it. Under Clause 56 a serious doubt has arisen as to whether the wholly owned subsidiary is a commercial participator or a fund-raising business. If it is either, the burdens imposed by Clause 58 become appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one provision to which I draw the Committee's attention. The subsidiary would be obliged to state,
	<br><blockquote><p>"what proportion of the consideration given for goods or services sold or supplied by him, or of any other proceeds of a promotional venture undertaken by him, is to be given to or applied for the benefit of the institution or institutions concerned".</p></blockquote>
It does not need a great imagination to picture what might happen as a result. Vast ranges of goods are often handled by such subsidiaries. I was for some years involved in the affairs of the Zoological Society of London. It has come to an end now, but I recollect, or I have a lively impression of, how impossible it would be to discharge such a burden. It would be a real nightmare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel reasonably confident that my noble friend will respond positively to the amendment. In what I regard as the very unlikely event of the Government not
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
accepting the amendment—they may not find these words acceptable—and if they cannot put something in their place which would adequately and fully meet the point enshrined in the amendment, then I should find myself obliged to take the step of voting for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the ideas behind the amendment. There has been a great deal of concern about the possible impact of the clause on volunteers. I know the Government are well aware of the difficulty and I need not pursue it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the point about independent trading companies on which I go along with what the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, has just said. Perhaps I could give one illustration, filling out the kind of problem he has raised. The National Trust has an independent trading company, National Trust Enterprises, which has notices on all its literature that the money or all the profits will go to the trust to help it with its conservation work. It sells over 1,600 lines of merchandise in its various shops and in 1990 it sold something like 11 million individual items. If it has to comply with the full horrors of Clause 58, it hardly bears thinking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale. The National Trust produced a case in support of the amendment which I found remarkably convincing. Not only does it sell 1,600 lines but there were 11 million sales. We are talking about very big business indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the briefings which Members of the Committee have received on the Bill were weighed, I suspect that those we received on Amendment No. 60 concerning this clause would probably be heavier than almost all the others put together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Council for Voluntary Organisations is obviously worried about this because the volunteers are a large and vital part of any charity organisation. If it is worried—and it seems to me it is justly worried—we should look carefully at what it has to say. When the NCVO and the National Trust seek to support the amendment, we should be doubly concerned to hear what they have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read it, the amendment simply attempts more accurately to distinguish the categories in this area. I should be interested to know from the noble Earl why it does not do so more effectively and efficiently than the present wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak only on the expression:
	<br><blockquote><p>"who for reward solicits money".</p></blockquote>
In my opinion a person who collects money for a charity in return only for the recoupment of his expenses is certainly not soliciting money for reward. For my part, I feel no doubt that a purely volunteer collector is not a professional fund-raiser within the definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This again is an important point. A number of Members of the Committee expressed concern during the Second Reading of the Bill about the scope of Part II which sets out to introduce a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
degree of regulation into the growing area of professional fund-raisers—people who raise funds on behalf of charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have reflected carefully on what was said during Second Reading and on the representations which have been made to me and my officials since then. I agree with my noble friend Lord Mottistone when he says that it was not the Government's intention to catch the volunteer. I do not think there is much between my noble friend Lord Swinfen and myself, or indeed between any other Members of the Committee who have spoken. We all wish to ensure that the provisions in Part II do not hinder legitimate and innovative fund-raising. We all wish to see charitable giving improved by effective regulation where that is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 adds to the list of people and institutions which may not be regarded as professional fund-raisers. It adds volunteers receiving expenses or a modest honorarium. I agree that volunteers who receive out-of-pocket expenses should not be regarded as professional fund-raisers. But it seems to me clear that they are already excluded from the definition of professional fund-raiser. They are not paid; they are not acting for reward. All they are doing is merely receiving reimbursement for the expenses they have incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to those who are paid a modest honorarium. I am not quite sure what "a modest honorarium" is, but I assume that it would be something in the order of £5 per day. Someone may be paid £5 a day for rattling his tin outside an Underground station, and it is clear that that person should not be within the definition of a professional fund-raiser. In so far as there is any difficulty or doubt about it, I shall introduce an amendment at a later stage of the Bill which will be designed to ensure that that person is not caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also exclude wholly-owned trading companies of charities from the definition of professional fund-raiser. I agree that where those bodies are controlled by the charity and where their profits are passed directly to the charity, they should fall outside the definition of professional fund-raiser. Again, I shall introduce an amendment at a later stage of the Bill to ensure that that doubt is removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the purpose of my noble friend's amendment concerning "promotional venture" is to ensure that only those promotional ventures which consist of a direct representation or solicitation to the potential donor are within the definition of the term. Amendments Nos. 73 and 79 seek a similar effect. The intention is to ensure that indirect involvement of fund-raising agents in appeals which are conducted by charities themselves are not regulated by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that these amendments achieve that end or that they are necessary. The word "direct" is not defined and I am not certain where a direct representation would begin and end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 60 introduces references to professional fund-raisers into the definition of promotional venture. However, for the purposes of Part II of the Bill, promotional venture has a meaning only with reference to a commercial participator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
I agree with my noble friend's intention. We do not want to catch as a professional fund-raiser the marketing consultant, for example, who gives advice to a charity on how it should prepare its fund-raising pamphlet, or indeed a direct mailing firm which might simply send out appeal letters on behalf of a charity, or another firm which might put the appeal notices into the envelopes. This type of indirect involvement does not fall within the scope of Clauses 57 to 60 as they are currently drafted. Those people, such as the ones who print the document, put it in the envelope and mail it, are acting as contractors. They are providing a service to the charity in the same way as a catering contractor might provide food for the charity. It is not intended that those people should be caught. Only when a person falling within the definition of professional fund-raiser makes the solicitation himself will he be regulated by the Bill, and rightly so. In the same way, one will only be regulated as a commercial participator if one makes representations of the kind described in Clause 56. Situations where a company sponsors a promotion which is undertaken by the charity itself—for example, a theatrical event—will not be regulated by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important area of the Bill. I hope I have explained our views on it, and the action we propose to take, and that I have clarified any doubts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend for his long response. It will require some thought. I shall examine it carefully. My noble friend appears to be going quite a long way down the path I should like him to go. However, in general, charities are extremely concerned that their legitimate fund-raising activities will be curtailed and damaged. They want the protection the Bill seeks to give, but at the same time they do not want their fund-raising efforts to be curtailed in any way as they constitute a major part of any charity's business. I thank my noble friend for the extensive discussions he had with me and my advisers between Second Reading and Committee stage. I hope he found those discussions helpful. I certainly did. I am happy for my noble friend to reconsider this clause before the next stage of the Bill. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 61:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 48, line 26, leave out subsection (3).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is a probing amendment which seeks to remove subsection (3) of Clause 56. I wondered whether the Government are seeking to regulate volunteer celebrities and other such people. I know that in the past Members of the Chamber have made appeals for charities. The Bill as drafted is too heavy handed on this issue. I hope this subsection may be deleted. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) of Clause 56 serves a specific purpose and its effect is perhaps narrower than my noble friend Lord Swinfen suggested. Subsection (3) deals with the case where a person has an arrangement with a charitable institution under which that person will be responsible for receiving money or properties solicited for the charity.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
Subsection (3) ensures that such a person will be regarded as soliciting money or property for the institution—if he would not otherwise have been doing so—for the purposes of Part II of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have in mind here is a situation where a celebrity undertakes a promotion for a charity; for example, by putting his name to the introduction to a charity trading catalogue and asking for donations to be paid directly to the charity. In such circumstances the celebrity would not necessarily be considered to be soliciting money for a charity if it were not for subsection (3). The essential consideration, however, is that this same celebrity will not be subject to the provisions of Part II of the Bill unless he solicits money for a charity, or is considered to do so by virtue of subsection (3), for reward. That is the important point. In other words, if he is not paid for putting his name to the introduction to the charity's trading catalogue, he is not a professional fund-raiser. However, if he is paid he would be a professional fund-raiser. That is the important difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 62:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 48, line 36, leave out subsection (4).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is purely a probing amendment. I hope the Government will explain the purpose of subsection (4). I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (4) of Clause 56 defines services for the purposes of Part II of the Bill. It is a wide definition drafted to ensure that a broad range of types of facility or service that may be offered by a person acting as a commercial participator are encompassed within the Bill. If some services were not defined in this way it is doubtful whether some types of commercial participation would be regarded as such for the purposes of the Bill; for example, some credit card companies offer their cards with the representation that in return for, let us say, every £100 spent by the cardholder the company will make a donation to a charity or charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only right that such an arrangement should be subject to regulation under Part II of the Bill to ensure that the cardholder knows how much money is to reach the charity and which charity is concerned. If the definition of services in subsection (4) were excluded it is doubtful whether the kind of arrangement I have described would be regarded as the provision of a product or a service. I hope that clarifies the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 56 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to raise a point that concerns the clause as a whole. I believe that before the word
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
"institution" on line 30 of page 47 we should add the word "charitable" as the clause concerns charitable contributions that are,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to be given to or applied for the benefit of the institution".</p></blockquote>
If that is the case I suspect we would need consequential amendments to clarify the wording of Clause 58. Perhaps that matter could be considered between now and the next stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my noble friend's point. I shall reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in difficult territory here. It is new territory and therefore it is not surprising that some problems arise. I have received a number of representations about the possible application of the definitions in this clause to broadcast appeals, and how far they are caught by the definition of commercial participator and professional fund-raiser in those cases where all the contributions go to the charity on whose behalf the broadcast appeal is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are commercial organisations such as telephone companies which supply pledge lines. There are banks, building societies and credit card companies which provide facilities for the receipt of donations. Will they be caught by these definitions? What about the Terry Wogans of this world who appear as presenters? Are they commercial participators as defined in the Clause? There is a good deal of concern about this matter and any clarification would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe I referred to celebrities when speaking to the previous amendment. I said that a professional fund-raiser is someone who seeks reward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe the noble Viscount spoke in a slightly different context on that occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that context is relevant. I can confirm that the definitions of professional fund-raiser and commercial participator are not intended to include commercial organisations providing services for broadcast appeals as part of their normal business. I am satisfied that the specific instances mentioned by the noble Lord would be excluded and that the commercial organisations to which he referred are not asking for a solicitation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may pursue this for a moment so that I at least understand it. Mr. Wogan, if he is paid to do the programme, then becomes a professional fund-raiser. If he is not paid and does it for free, he does not become a professional fund-raiser. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is part of his normal work, no, because that is part of his work for the television company or whoever else is providing the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is he not then soliciting money for reward? He is being paid his normal salary to do his specific job. That is his reward and he is soliciting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
money from the public. This is precisely the type of point that many people are worried about. It seems to me that he would be caught by the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that he is not making an appeal for reward. He is doing his job for reward. That is covered by the definition, to which I referred earlier, where commercial organisations are providing services for broadcast as part of their normal business. That is covered by that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the same true for all those people who appear on the great telethons and money-raising functions like Comic Relief? Those people may not normally appear on television shows but may be granted the standard very low fee for a television appearance. Is that for reward or is the amount so nugatory that it does not matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said before, I do not think that a television or radio personality acting as a presenter for the purposes of the broadcast field would normally come within the definition of professional fund-raiser. He or she might not be a commercial participator in the strict sense. If a personality does not accept any reward he or she would certainly be excluded from the definition of professional fund-raiser. The position is not so clear-cut when the celebrity is paid a fee if he has participated in the broadcast as part of his normal job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of a broadcaster by profession. If his contract with the television company required him to participate in a telethon as part of his normal salaried duties he would not appear to be caught by the terms of the legislation. If, however, the personality was paid specifically for making the appeal he would have to be regarded as a professional fund-raiser for the purposes of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking at this point in the light of the representations made to us. It is of course open to the personality who is due a fee for making the appeal to repay it to the charity. If he does so he will be not acting for reward and will not be caught by the terms of the legislation. I understand that that can happen where a personality's agreement with his agent requires him to receive an appearance fee but he may not wish to benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a final point. The noble Viscount will recognise that there is considerable confusion and disquiet about this definition and about the subject of whether the Wogans of this world are paid, unpaid, salaried, give the money back or do not give the money back. When the Government are considering the point again will they recognise the fact that people are worried about this matter? The noble Viscount said that the position was not so clear when someone had a salary. Perhaps it should be just as clear in that situation as in the others. Will he give an undertaking to consider the matter very carefully indeed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the noble Viscount say whether a bank is a commercial participator in these

circumstances? At least one bank issues credit cards. It donates a percentage of the customers' monthly debits to a charity. One bank does it for the benefit of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Is that bank a commercial participator?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many organisations are doing this. It is being sold very hard to charities. I wonder whether it would be helpful to the Minister and his advisory team if between now and the next stage they were to go to a number of charities to find out what methods of fund-raising they currently undertake and what is being sold to them. I doubt whether the Ministers or their advisers have ever acted as fund-raisers to charities. Indeed, there is no reason why they should have done so. We must make certain that the clause is worded in such a way that it is helpful to charities with regard to protection without preventing them from fund-raising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is right that charities should have appropriate control of fund-raising activities undertaken on their behalf by external agents. Through the establishment of the agreement and the prescribed requirements within it charities will have that control. However, as currently worded only charities will have this level of control granted to them by law. If it is right for charities to have this control it must be right also for other non-profit making fund-raising organisations to have this level of control as well. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our intention in Clause 57 was to address the main mischief which was identified in the White Paper and before. That was the exploitation of charities by disreputable fund-raisers. There was no suggestion at that time that benevolent or philanthropic institutions were subject to a similar kind of mischief. I have had a number of representations about this point and my noble friend's amendment directs our attention to it again.

I have concluded that there is no reason why fund-raisers who make arrangements with non-charitable benevolent institutions should not be brought within the scope of Clause 57. Therefore, I am happy to accept the principle behind my noble friend's amendments. We have some problem with the wording of the amendments, in particular with the use of the words "appropriate body", the purpose of which is not clear. If my noble friend would be good
