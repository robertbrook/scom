	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Gregor MacKenzie)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (Compensation for Smelter Deficits) Order 1979.</p></blockquote>
The Committee will be well aware of the background to this draft order which is the third to be laid under the provisions of the Electricity (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1976.1 propose, therefore, to deal only very briefly with the history of the smelter supply arrangements. In 1968, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board entered into a contract with the British Aluminium Company to supply electricity to the company's aluminium reduction plant at Invergordon. The electricity was to be provided by the Hunterston B nuclear power station which was being built for the South of Scotland Electricity Board at that time. The company undertook to pay an appropriate share both of the costs of constructing the power station and of the annual running costs in return for guaranteed supplies of electricity. In the early years, before Hunterston B was expected to be commissioned, the contract provided for power to be supplied to the smelter from conventional power stations. It was recognised that this arrangement would inevitably result in losses being incurred by the Hydro Board in the early stages, but it was expected that these would be recovered by the Board over the remainder of the contract period when the benefits of nuclear generation would be available. The Government none the less recognised at the time that the sums of money involved were very large in relation to the scale of the board's operations and therefore gave the board an assurance that, in the event of a substantial loss arising, consideration would be given to the position of the board's other consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
It transpired that a four-year delay in the commissioning of Hunterston B led to substantial losses for the board in the early years of the contract and because of restrictions on the output of the station making it necessary for part of the smelter's requirements to be met from fossil-fuelled power stations, it is likely that the board will continue to incur deficits on the supply of electricity to the smelter for the remainder of the period of the contract. The Government therefore took power under the 1976 Act to compensate the board for these deficits so that they would not fall on the board's other consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for the continuing losses being made by the board under the smelter contract and the considerations which led the Government to agree to pay compensation for these losses were discussed at length during the passage of the 1976 Act and again during this Committee's deliberations on the two previous orders made under that Act. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will share my view that it would not be appropriate for me to take up its time this morning with a lengthy rehearsal of these matters. Instead I propose to concentrate on the draft order which relates to the deficit arising in the financial year 1977–78, and to outline the developments during that year which have a bearing on the compensation payment proposed in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may have wondered why this order was not laid last summer when the size of the deficit incurred by the board in the financial year 1977–78 became known. The reason for the delay is that the Government have had to give lengthy consideration to the question of how much of the 1977–78 deficit should be reimbursed to the board at this stage. The deficit in the published accounts for 1977–78 is larger than it might otherwise have been in that the board has made charges to the British Aluminium Company under a number of heads which the company has so far refused to pay, because it takes the view that it is not liable for these charges under its contract with the board. The disputed charges relate to nuclear fuel reprocessing, the costs of repairs to reactor 4 at Hunterston and certain items on the capital account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of these difficulties and certain other complexities in the 1977–78 accounts my right hon Friend the Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
commissioned a firm of independent consultant accountants to examine the board's smelter accounts for 1976–77 and 1977–78. The committee will recall that a similar examination of the deficits arising in the period to the end of the financial year 1975–76 was undertaken before these deficits were reimbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report by the consultants confirmed that, given the board's interpretation of its agreements with the South of Scotland Electricity Board and with the company, the charges to the smelter account and to the company had been correctly calculated. The consultants pointed out, however, that the interpretation of the contract between the board and the company was a matter for the parties to resolve, and that if the company were eventually to pay these disputed charges the final deficit on the smelter account for 1977–78 would be substantially reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the consultants' findings my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has decided that it would be improper, while negotiations between the company and the board are continuing, for the Government to pay compensation to the board for that part of the deficit which represents these disputed charges. The disputed items have increased the deficit in 1977–78 by some £3.5 million on the smelter revenue account and just over £500,000 on the capital account. The figures in question include associated financing costs, that is the interest incurred by the board in carrying these deficits on the smelter account during the financial year 1977–78. The result of the Government's consideration of the disputed charges, therefore, is that the deficit for which we propose to make compensation this year is reduced by some £4 million. Whether or not the Government eventually have to meet this sum depends on the outcome of the dispute between the board and the company. The Government are pressing the board to seek an early resolution of this dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further complication has arisen in that, in the course of the consultants examination, it was established that a sum of approximately £1.7 million which was paid to the board in compensation for the deficit incurred in the year ended March 1977—that is the sum paid under the previous order—also related to a charge to the British Aluminium Company for nuclear fuel reprocessing. As this charge was similarly in dispute it had not been
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
paid by the company. After consulting the board on the matter my right hon. Friend considers it right that a sum equal to the charge in question together with interest for the period since the sum was paid, should be deducted from the contribution which we would otherwise have intended to make towards reimbursement of the deficit arising on the smelter accounts in 1977–78. This has the effect of reducing by a further £2 million approximately the deficit which we propose to reimburse. Again this is a sum which the Government may eventually have to pay to the board, depending on the outcome of the dispute with the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other factor which had an important effect on the size of the deficit for 1977–78 was the outage of reactor 4 at Hunterston. The Committee will recall the incident which took place in October 1977 when sea water entered part of the cooling system of the reactor. As a result of this incident insulation material in the pressure vessel annulus below the boilers was damaged and the reactor had to be shut down for the insulation to be replaced. The loss of production of cheap nuclear-based electricity from reactor 4 has inevitably increased the operating deficit on the smelter account, because of the need to provide make-up units to the smelter from higher cost fossil-fuelled stations. It is worth noting that the other reactor at Hunterston B has performed well throughout the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the actual payments specified in the draft order. The deficit recorded in the board's accounts for 1977–78 was £14.6 million. About £2.4 million of this sum is provision for future costs for which the board is not at present seeking compensation. The sum remaining is therefore approximately £12.2 million £1 million of which relates to capital contributions, with the remainder constituting the deficit on revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deduction of the items in dispute— namely, just over £5.5 million on the revenue account, including the sum reimbursed in 1977, and the £½million on the capital account—brings the proposed payments down to about £5.5 million on the revenue account and £½ million on the capital account. As required by the 1976 Act, the board has been consulted about the drafting of the order and the Treasury has indicated its approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to consider the draft order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamish Gray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first occasion on which we have considered an order created under the Electricity (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1976 in which there is likely to be any degree of controversy. I say that because the British Aluminium Company, and probably also —for different reasons—the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board have doubts about this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a keen supporter of the policy of the Labour Government in 1968—before I came to this House—when they selected Invergordon, in my constituency, for the siting of the British Aluminium smelter. The British Aluminium Company smelter has contributed considerably to the present welfare of Easter Ross. It has provided about 900 jobs. It has settled well into what was almost entirely an agricultural community, despite the fact— as Mr. Tony Mackay, lecturer at Aberdeen University recently pointed out—that unemployment in my part of the Highlands is now greater than it was before the smelter was built. This is a matter of very great regret to me, and in no way would I lay that at the door of the Government of the day for adopting that policy. I believe that they were right at that time, and I welcomed the development, as I still do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I feel that we would be failing in our duties as Members of Parliament if we did not carefully scrutinise what that policy did, and what it has subsequently led to in terms of the spending of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asked today to approve payment of approximately £6 million. In March 1977 the first order was presented by the Government and at that time we were considering payment of approximately £39 million. I quote from the proceedings of the Sixth Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments in July 1977 and from the statement by the Minister of State—who is again in charge of our proceedings today—on 20th July:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first order provided for the board to be compensated for the accumulated deficit of £39 million incurred in the period to 31st March 1976. The draft second order now before us covers a further year's loss by providing, in Article 3, for a payment of just over £11 million to be made to the board as reimbursement of the deficit incurred in the financial year 1976–1977." 
	<i>Official Report, Sixth Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments,</i> &c, 
	<i>20 July 1977;</i></p></blockquote>
Today, we are being asked to consider the payment of a further £6 million. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
totals £56 million, which is a substantial amount of money and which we must scrutinise if we are to do our job properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original contract outlined that the provisions in the supply contract relating to the annual charges required to meet the cost of generation at Hunterston B were based on the assumption that the station would achieve a load factor of 78 per cent. No similar station has achieved anything like that load factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that there was something wrong with the original negotiations. The British Aluminium Company must be highly delighted with the way in which the participants in the negotiations conducted themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It got itself a very good indeed, and I am delighted about that because my constituency is benefiting. But in examining the matter as a Mob Parliament considering the spending of public money, I feel considerable concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the deficits is that any shortfall which arose from the fact that 78 per cent, was not reached has to be made up from more expensive fossil fuel sources. That, again, is a serious matter, because it seems to me that this will be a recurring order. As far as I can see, the order will come before us year after year, and all the Committee and the House can do is approve it, becuase it is part of a contract which was fairly entered upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have reached the stage when we must question the desirability of the Government entering into long-term contracts such as this without the most positive reassurance that the bargain will be to the Government's benefit. I do not suggest that they should have entered into a long-term contract which would make it impossible for the British Aluminium Company to continue. That would be equally ridiculous, but for a Government to have to face up to about £56 million in subsidy—a subsidy which is likely to be continued at the rate, at a modest estimate of perhaps £6 million a year—is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy with the British Aluminium Company. Why should the company now be faced with the cost, for example, of nuclear fuels processing? That was not part of the original contract. Why should the company be asked to pay additional sums becuase the Hunterston B power station has not lived up to expectations? We all hope that that situation is only temporary and that in due course
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Hunterston will be an unqualified success. But we must face facts, and at present Hunterston is far from successful. That is why we have to meet today to discuss the spending of considerable sums of taxpayers' money in the form of subsidy to make up for the deficits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to speak for too long because, as the Minister of State rightly said, we have had many opportunities to discuss these orders and the provisions of the Act under which they arise, but it is worrying that we face this recurring situation. We are responsible for all public bodies having public accountability, and it is to us that such bodies must look for guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall agree to the motion this morning, I do not think that we can do anything else. But I alert the Committee to the fact that this matter gives grave cause for concern. Although I was a supporter of the original policy, with hindsight I doubt very much whether any Government would feel complacent or happy about what has ultimately developed in this project.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.50 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin F. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up one or two points made by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) and put a couple of questions to my right hon. Friend the Minister of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my right hon. Friend is not happy at having to lay this order, or at having had to introduce the 1976 Act. The experience we have had with the smelter contract has been salutary. In 1968 we entered into a long-term contract for several decades, based on assumptions of the technological capacity and performance of a reactor that not only had not then been built, but of which design no reactor had ever been built, in Britain It is not surprising that at the end of the day we find our fingers burned. I am inclined to wonder whether are many major commercial concerns have entered into contracts on that kind of basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is even worse than the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty indicated. An even more significant element in the reason that the Hunterston output has been unable to meet the smelter tranche is not just the load factor. It is that long before the AGRs were commissioned, their expected output was significantly derated. That was unfortunate for the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
and for the Government. It happened after 1968. It is not surprising that they were forced to reconsider the output that could be obtained from this station when none of the stations had actually been created at the time the parties entered into the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to press the point too heavily. We are all agreed that the order will have to go through. We do not want to introduce any unecessary controversy. But I suggest that this matter should caution us against a too facile acceptance of some of the claims that are made for the nuclear future and how successful nuclear power will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past these predictions have turned out to be false, and in this order we see the cost of relying on such false predictions. We should treat similar predictions for the future with greater caution and scepticism in the light of that experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take up the point made in my right hon. Friend the Minister of State in his introductory remarks, when he referred to cheaper electricity from nuclear power. He is correct that the running costs of producing electricity by nuclear power are much lower than of producing it from fossil fuels. Fuel for the fossil output has to be purchased, whereas that is not necessary to the same degree for nuclear output.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one looks at the overall cost of producing electricity one has to take into account not only the running costs, but the capital costs. As we are aware from the last annual report for South of Scotland Electricity Board, the difference between the two forms of electricity—one produced from nuclear power and the other from fossil fuel—is significant. In fact, if anything, that produced from nuclear power is marginally more expensive that that produced from fossil fuels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reactor 4 at Hunterston, which was built at great expense and represents a considerable capital expenditure, and which was shut down for two years, the balance between the two leans more heavily in favour of fossil fuels. That is because on this very expensive installation capital charges still have to be met, while it provides no revenue. That is the reason we are discussing this order this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put two specific questions to my right hon. Friend. I am sure that he will be able to help us on the first, namely the item about nuclear fuel reprocessing to which the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty referred. I share his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
puzzlement as to how this arose in the contract between the British Aluminium Company and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board. It is not clear why that item has been lower than anticipated in 1968. The cost of re-processing has not shifted significantly in the past 10 years. It would be helpful if my right hon. Friend could clarify that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is of greater significance and I anticipate that it might be difficult for my right hon. Friend to answer. We are now in out third year of laying orders to compensate the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board for its contract with the British Aluminium Company. It will be helpful if my hon. Friend will give us an up-to-date estimate of the amount by which we are likely to be subsidising the North Board as a result of its contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1976 Act is relatively open-ended and makes no estimate of the overall cost to the taxpayer and to the public purse. As we go through these annual orders it would be helpful if the Minister could indicate on a year-by-year basis what the sum is likely to be. I think the figures are likely to be higher than those suggested by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty. He was working on a figure of £6 million for this year but of course that neglects the £4 million that was deducted to which my right hon. Friend referred. The true deficit this year is £10 million. It happens that fortunately we have been able to write off £4 million. Does that mean that in future years we shall look to an annual deficit of £10 million? If so, what is the final outturn likely to be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a few general remarks. I recall that the Act stipulated that about £300 million was to be set aside to meet this deficit. My calculations show that we have already allowed for the spending of £70.8 million, or thereabouts, on the subsidy. If that were spread among the population of Scotland, it would be a fairly hefty per capita sum and would not go down well with the taxpayers who were asked to foot the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be much more careful about the way in which we examine the electricity side of this issue. Here we are dealing with a mistake which was made some 10 or
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
11 years ago. It is difficult for us now to delve into the reasons for the mistake. I could suggest reasons. The calculations were based on an experimental system for which high hopes were held. But that experimental AGR system ran into trouble in construction. There was a delay in producing the power concerned. Finally, there was the problem of the reactor 4 at Hunterston which was taken out of use. That, of course, added to the costs, and those outrage costs are quite considerable. It has been estimated that up to between about £32 million and £36 million may be charged to the consumer becuase of that unfortunate accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ten years ago the Government of the day—presumably, with the consent of the House—felt that there were industrial and trading benefits in establishing smelters in the United Kingdom. We are aware that this is not the only smelter. There were plans for one big smelter which was subsequently split into three parts, and one part of that huge smelter went to Invergordon. The intention was to produce more aluminium at home and thus save national trading costs. But the Government at that time may well have had to take into account also the fact that they had to face competition from Canada and Scandinavia which at that time had relatively cheap energy costs. Of course in the production of aluminium the major cost is not the cost of the raw material, the alumina, but the cost of the electricity that is required on a huge scale to produce that aluminium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have visited the production unit at Invergordon. I agree that it is a very useful project, but in retrospect one has to look at the cost of the whole project. If it is said that because the Government have entered into a contract with British Aluminium the taxpayer will have to fund the cost, one wonders, had one known what the rolling cost would be, what changes there might have been in the negotiations. If one could fault the Government of the day it would be for having based the commercial calculations on insubstantial data. To my mind, it was not data on which they could rely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an example, even at that time, of very expensive mistakes made by the British Gas Corporation in a long-term contract with ICI for supplying gas at well under the economic price. Once locked into the contact, there was not much the corporation could do but to see that cheap
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
gas being sold at a price which it would not otherwise have envisaged, while the price of that energy source continued to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any bank had followed the example of the Government's activities over the Invergordon smelter, it might well have ended up in difficulty, as happened with the secondary banks. It was the same mistake. Here the Government have lent long but have borrowed short. It is only the annual payments from the Exchequer which are meeting the costs of that particular contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point about calculations such as this is that, if a relatively simple mistake could have been made 10 years ago about electricity production and the cost of electricity, surely we should be very careful now about the estimates of capacity by the South of Scotland Electricity Board. If there were one valuable job that a Scottish Select Committee could do, it would be to examine in detail the production plans and the capacity outlook for electricity production in Scotland. If we could come to grips with that, we might at least be able to point to some of the dangers of an increased cost of electricity if capacity should exceed likely demand. It would mean that the individual cost per unit of electricity would be much higher, because the capital deployed in the unused capacity would have to be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred to a dispute between British Aluminium and the North Board about certain reprocessing and other charges. Can he tell us what will happen to the North Board's consumers if the board fails in its claim against British Aluminium? Will the Government ensure consumers do not suffer from such a loss?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister estimate the likely effect of the Hunterston outage on the current year's costs of electricity supplied to the British Aluminium smelter? To what extent will the annual bill for the smelter account be raised because of the accident? I understand that there was a problem of termination of supply of electricity to British Aluminium, which caused some difficulty with the smelting processes. Will that claim have an impact on the estimate of the annual Exchequer subsidy to the North Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that this order is to be an annual event for us for a long time to come. As all the speeches so
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
far this morning have emphasised, we are not discussing the order from the point of view of whether we should reject it— although I know that that is the technical position—because we are landed with it. The Government's calculations, as far as we can check them, seem to be acceptable, and so clearly we shall agree to the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as each hon. Member has so far indicated, we must try to learn some sound lessons from this sad and sorry story. I begin by accepting at once that the intentions of everyone concerned have been thoroughly admirable throughout. The matter originated when all of us—the Government of the day, the Opposition and everyone else—were extremely anxious not to lose the opportunity of securing home-based aluminium smelting capacity. We wished to do what we could to make that possible, and we were all in favour of doing so by producing electricity for the smelter at the most reasonable cost. There I believe we all agreed, and to that extent we are all partly responsible for what has happened since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our comments should not, therefore, be seen as a criticism or witch hunt of those who did their best to implement our wishes if we point out that the whole matter has been a chapter of disasters, except in so far as we have, thank goodness, the highly successful smelter in the Highlands which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) says, has been a tremendous boon to the area. That is the only good point about the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind that everyone was doing his best, this seems to be the classic case where the desire of everyone to achieve a result was allowed to distort the calculations, decisions and value judgments that were made in drawing up the agreement. The present problems about disputed costs give a splendid example of how such an agreement can go wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always difficult to make decisions— particularly financial decisions—on very large matters where tremendous prizes are gained or lost according to the decision made. To take up a point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Cook) I think it is legitimate to say that there is a difference between making a difficult financial decision when, if it is wrong, the company will go under and, on the other hand, making the same decision free of such a sanction and with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
only a very remote long-term consequence which will not affect the taxpayers of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening now is that the taxpayer—without realising it—is paying a great deal of money, as the my hon. Friend the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) said, in order to pay for the mistakes in calculations made in 1968 and afterwards. It behoves us in Parlt, even though we all share some responsibility for those mistakes, to make this clear and try to draw the lessons from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to consider briefly the matters at present in dispute, because they illustrate how impracticable the whole operation was from the beginning, except in its ultimate aim of attracting the British Aluminium Company's account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of the repair costs to Hunterston reactor 4.1 doubt whether it was reasonable in the first place to base the whole agreement on the technology of a wholly unproven system. But, surely, even if it had been a reasonable decision, to bring into the issue the financial costs of an accident which took place as a result of human error some 13 years after the original agreement was made is an unacceptable extension of the original calculations. I am not a lawyer and I cannot make pronouncements on the matter, but common sense suggests that it is not quite fair to expect the British Aluminium Company to pay some part, not of the capital costs, or even of the escalating running costs, but of the financial results of an accident which was due to human error in the plant. That seems very extraordinary to me, and I cannot see how the original 1968 agreement could properly have been held to take that into account. That is a matter for the lawyers to sort out. It is, however, a lesson to us that such matters must be thought of in time in any similar future undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of nuclear fuel reprocessing charges. I am not quite sure of the position—no doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—but I believe that the cost of nuclear fuel had to be taken into account and that the escalation in its cost was included in that figure. But I am not clear whether the cost of reprocessing nuclear fuel was also specifically included. There is a difference—the Minister may know whether there is a difference in law—between the cost of the fuel and the escalation thereof, and the cost
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
of reprocessing fuel. Reprocessing is not necessarily the cost of producing the fuel in the first place although it is a commitment that anyone who produces and uses fuel eventually has to fulfil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that in that case, too, there was a lack of definition in the original agreement. Everyone knew that the fuel would have to be reprocessed. We should be told—if we can be told—whether reprocessing was included in the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also the disputed capital costs. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that the provision was that the capital costs of Hunterston B would be taken into account up to the time when it was expected to be finished which was in 1975. In 1968, therefore, it was envisaged that it would be finished by 1975 and that the capital costs up till then would be taken into account and charged as part of the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would not have had to be a particularly perspicacious prophet to decide, in 1968, that a guesstimate then of a completion date of 1975 was, to say the least, extremely unlikely to be fulfilled. After all, the completion of Hunterston A was delayed by an immense time by industrial disputes and so on, not to mention—as hon. Members have said this morning— that Magnox reactors had not been proved and were at the frontiers of technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking back, and being wise after the event, I am led by those three points to the conclusion that an agreement entered into on such an imprecise basis so long before it was to be in a current state—and this will continue for years yet—was, although all concerned had the best intentions and did the best they could, an extremely irresponsible piece of calculation at the time. I do not suggest that anyone should now be blamed for it, except that we are all partly to blame. But we must learn the lessons of that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise one related matter with the Minister—the performance of Hunterston B. At our previous debate on this matter, on 20 July 1977, I asked about the corrosion that has been a feature of the Magnox reactors, and the arrangements made to deal with it at both Hunterston A and Hunterston B. The Minister could not answer at that time, but he kindly wrote to me on 8 August 1977, explaining the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, when Hunterston A came into commission, it was found
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
to be suffering from some corrosion within the reactor. As a result, the output of Hunterston A was considerably reduced to minimise the corrosion and to enable it to be monitored in the future. So far, so good, but at that time Hunterston B had been designed and was under construction. When the corrosion was discovered in Hunterston A, efforts were made to deal with the matter for Hunterston B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State's letter to me, dated 8 August 1977, made this clear. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The existence of this type of mild steel corrosion was recognised during the deisgn stage of the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors at Hunterston B and appropriate modifications were made. It was subsequently found from laboratory tests, however, that somewhat similar corrosion could occur with alloyed steels at higher temperatures. "</p></blockquote>
I am not an engineer, still less a nuclear engineer. Neither am I a metallurgist. But as a person who tries to apply common sense to the matter, I feel that the experts advising the electricity boards have much to answer for here. When the corrosion problem was discovered in Hunterston A and steps were being taken to avoid something similar in Hunterston B—steps that the Minister of State described in his letter as "appropriate modifications"—that was fine, and I am sure that the experts did their best. But to go ahead with Hunterston B, having made those modifications, and subsequently—in the words of the Minister's letter—to find
	<br><blockquote><p>"from laboratory tests that somewhat similar corrosion could occur with alloyed steels at higher temperatures"</p></blockquote>
suggests to me some technical negligence. I am sure that these things are difficult to discover. But if the corrosion had been found ^within Hunterston A, and I were the expert responsible for trying to prevent the same trouble in Hunterston B, I would make sure that I did the laboratory tests on all the metals to be used on any part of the interior of the reactor very thoroughly before I allowed Hunterston B to go ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the worrying factor not so much what has been happening at Hunterston A and B, but what might now happen in the design application for Torness? Will the same problems crop up there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I should have thought that, corrosion having been found in the first place,
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
immense precautions would be taken to see that every conceivable possibility of it occurring again was reduced. It would be acceptable if the corrosion in Hunterston B was wholly new, of a nature which no one could have foreseen. Perhaps we can be told that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who hold office on public boards and their technical advisers have a heavy responsibility. A public body is not the same as a commercial undertaking, where all those concerned literally stand to lose their livelihood—they may even go bankrupt—if they make the wrong decisions. In public affairs this does not happen, but when something goes wrong, trenchant, clear and specific criticism must be made. I make that criticism now. I believe that the tests that were made to prevent corrosion in Hunterston B cannot have been adequate. They cannot have covered all the metals involved, or all the possible places where high temperatures could cause such corrosion. To that extent I believe that the tests were imperfectly carried out, and that the advice given was not good. We should learn a lesson from that for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have gone into this matter in some detail, not because I wish to conduct any sort of witch hunt—because, as I have said, all those concerned have done their best throughout—but because if controlling public money and taking responsibility for decisions in public undertakings means anything, it means that Parliament must put its finger on these matters when they arise. They have arisen. It is clear to the lay mind that a lot of things have gone seriously wrong. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that serious lessons are being learned, and that he will do everything he can to ensure that in the future such mistakes are not made again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregor MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One question has been raised by every hon. Gentleman this morning. Have we as an Administration—indeed the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) was a member of the Administration responsible for this matter between 1970 and 1974—learned any lessons from this sad business? I believe that all of us, irrespective of party have learned a few lessons from this business. But I say to everyone in the Committee stressing a strong personal view, that we are being wise after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we have to be fair to the people concerned at that time—the members of the Government, leading members of the Opposition and the then Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland all of whom were most enthusiastic about this matter—as enthusiastic as was the Secretary of State himself. There was a great desire to do something to help that part of the constituency of the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may now be felt that everyone then rather went overboard about the whole business. The hon. Gentleman said in his opening remarks this morning that there are now 980 jobs in the area, jobs that would not have been there, and, as the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) says with some regularity in these debates —they are very costly jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all concerned that this matter is now a heavy drain on the public purse. All of us have learned a great deal from what has happened over the past few years.

I do not know who will introduce a similar order next time—it may be me, or, because of the democratic processes that we operate in this country, it may be someone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not be too cheery if I were the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger.) I was thinking of someone else on this side of the House. I do not contemplate for a moment that anyone on the Opposition Benches will be introducing it. But no matter who introduces it, it is embarrassing for any Minister to come—as we shall have to come for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
number of years—to ask for a considerable sum of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty, among others, whether the company should be asked to pay for nuclear fuel re-processing. Re-processing of nuclear fuel is an integral part of the operation of nuclear power stations. It has nothing to do with the performance at Hunterston so far. This dispute is about whether BACO is liable for these charges, and it is a matter of interpretation of the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of issues about the contract have arisen this morning. I am rather hesitant about going into all the fine details of the dispute becuase the Government are not involved. It is a matter between the board and BACO. If the worst comes to the worst it may well be that one or the other will have to take the matter to a court of law and I would not want to say anything that would prejudice the natural fair justice that results at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an explanation of why the charge for reprocessing should be made. It is a technical matter. I will give the explanation that I have been giving. Nuclear fuel differs from conventional fuels once used in electricity generating in that pure elements, once they go into the reactor remain there for several years. The South Board therefore operates an account which takes into consideration the actual and estimated future costs of replacing and discharging fuel for Hunterston B including the reprocessing. It aims to ensure that the operating charges for each year bear as equitable a share as possible of all fuel costs arising or expected to arise as a result of the operation of the station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spent fuel from Hunterston B is to be reprocessed by British Nuclear Fuels at the Windscale plant which is at present undergoing a major expansion. Although reprocessing on a signficant scale will not take place for some time the South Board is making charges on the ground that it believes—and I think this is right—that it would be unfair for reprocessing costs to be borne only by private consumers. So the charge for reprocessing made by the North Board to the British Aluminium Company—one which as I say has not been paid—relates to the tranche at Hunterston B assigned to the purposes of providing electricity for the smelter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin F. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us that very helpful reply. I should like to ask him another question which arises from that reply. I appreciate that he will probably not wish to reply to it now but he may wish to reply in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as a separate account for reprocessing the nuclear fuel, the SSEB last year started to operate a separate account for the decommissioning costs of its nuclear power stations. Last year the board set aside £6 million for a sinking fund towards that on precisely the same argument that those using nuclear electricity in this year should have set aside some sum towards the quite substantial cost that will eventually arise from dismantling Hunterston B. Will the same position arise in connection with the contract with British Aluminium, and will British Aluminium also be expected to contribute towards those costs as well as the cost of reprocessing fuel currently in the reactor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will write to my hon. Friend on that point. If my memory serves me aright the company will not be expected to contribute to that but I will check on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised a general point about the cost of nuclear power and other forms of energy. He has made that point to me with some regularity. I think I conceded in the course of the last Adjournment debate on the matter that the difference is fairly insignificant, but I have sought to persuade my hon. Friend that costs are not the only matter to be considered. In an area where we have a considerable shortage of energy and where we expect shortages in the future, we need to use to the best advantage every form of energy available to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked me about the estimates of the total smelter bill. The order under discussion and the two previous compensation provide for the reimbursement to the North Board of about £71 million. The future prospects for the smelter account depend very much upon the performance of Hunterston B and the eventual outcome of negotiations on the disputed charges. These uncertainties prevent any meaningful forecast now being made of deficits arising in the period to about the year 2000 when the contract expires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East said that the 1976 Act set aside £300 million for
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
these deficits. I do not think that that figure is quite correct. If I remember correctly the Government said at the time only that the total could be as high as £200 million. I remember stressing the words " could be " at the time. The size of the deficit depends, as I have said, on the performance of Hunterston B and the trends of world prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East also asked me about the interruption which occurred last year. The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray) raised that matter with me on a number of occasions when we had the very severe weather in the winter of 1977–78. To the best of my knowledge, the British Aluminium Company has not yet approached the North Board with any proposition that it should be reimbursed in any way. I took the view then—although I was not approached— that that was a matter for the company's insurers to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East also asked me about the possibility that a Scottish Select Committee might look at the board's demand forecasts. These matters are fairly regularly discussed between officials of my office and of the boards, and we have discussed them ourselves from time to time in this Committee. It strikes me that the hon. Gentleman could quite properly raise the matter with the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries. I have always been rather puzzled about his reticence. He raised the matter before, I think during our discussion on the Act. There would be nothing improper in the Select Committee discussing the topic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the cost of the Hunterston outage for this year. It is difficult to work out the ultimate cost. I am a little disappointed, because several estimates have been made to me of the cost of the repairs and also—I am not critical of the Board on this—of the time that it will take to do the repairs. A number of matters are out with the Board's control—industrial disputes and so on. As far as I know at present, it will probably cost about £13.5 million in total—a substantial amount of money. The cost of the outage this year is likely to be between £3 million and £4 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ayr and others also asked me why the cost of the repairs is being charged to the smelter account. The North Board takes the view that repair costs for reactor 4 are governed by a clause
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
in the 1968 contract which allows a sub-charge to be made for escalation of the total operating costs of Hunterston B above a stated base figure. Although BACO is prepared to contribute to normal repair and maintenance costs for its share of Hunterston B, the company is unwilling, as I indicated, to accept any liability for any part of the cost of repairing reactor 4. The discussions, however, are still continuing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will think about this, and write to me later about it There seems to be a matter of principle here. Leaving aside the accident to Hunterston B to which we referred—I do not wish to refer to that again—supposing that another accident took place due to the negligence of the board. Surely it would be hard to charge the British Aluminium Company for something that was due to the negligence of the board. We should consider that hypothetical situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can understand the hon. Gentleman's attitude. If something was due to the Board's negligence, we should all be worried about making such a charge. As I indicated earlier, this
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
dispute is one reason why we are not asking Parliament for the money. We hope that the Board and BACO can resolve the matter amicably. It is one reason why we thought it improper to go further with the matter now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the important problems of corrosion. As I think he knows, because he commented on it either during the passage of the Act or on one of the later orders—that Hunterston B was fairly advanced in construction, not just in design, when the corrosion problem at Hunterston A was discovered. Torness, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, is at the design stage, and by contrast I can assure him that there the corrosion problem is being taken into account.
