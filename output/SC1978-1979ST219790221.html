	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Estates of Deceased Persons and on Gifts) (United States of America) Order 1978.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if with this we were to take the following:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Canada) Order 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Estates of Deceased Persons and on Gifts) (Republic of South Africa) Order 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remind the Committee that in taking the three orders together, we are still bound by the time limit, which means that we must conclude by 12 noon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal, first, with the two conventions with the United States and South Africa because they both relate to taxes on estates. They represent a further instalment in the renegotiation of the estate duty agreements which was made necessary by the introduction of capital transfer tax. They both replace conventions made shortly after the war-As well as taking account of subsequent changes to the tax systems in the respective countries, these new conventions improve the reliefs available where property is doubly taxed. In particular, they apply to taxes on life-time gifts as well as to death duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both coventions are based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model death duties convention approved by the OECD Council in 1966. For many years our income tax conventions have been based on an OECD
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
model, but this is the first occasion on which an OECD model has been followed at all closely by this country in a death duties convention. It may be helpful if I first comment on the main provisions of the model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the OECD model, the country in which the deceased is domiciled is, in general, given the sole right to tax the deceased person's estate, wherever it is situated. The country in which the deceased was not domiciled for the purposes of the convention may, however, tax immovable property and unincorporated businesses, or business branches, situated in its territory together with certain ships and aircraft; the country in which the deceased was domiciled giving relief for any resultant double taxation. To prevent these rules from being misused by someone changing his domicile shortly before death, the official commentary on the model provides in such a case for the country in which the deceased was previously domiciled to have a subsidiary right to tax the whole estate for 10 years after the time when he ceased to be domiciled there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The model, of course, cannot take account of all the policies and laws of OECD member States and some members have reserved their position on particular articles. The Americans, for example, reserved the right to tax their own nationals, and in 1966 the United Kingdom reserved the right to tax shares in United Kingdom companies. The reservation still stands but, as will be apparent from the American convention, we recognise that there are arguments for giving up the right to tax shares if the other provisions of the convention are satisfactory. The OECD model does not cover gift taxes, but the Committee may like to know that a study group, on which the United Kingdom is represented, is looking at the possibility of extending the convention to cover gift taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main difference between the model convention and the estate duty conventions is that the latter divided up taxing rights by providing detailed situs rules whereas the OECD model allocates taxing rights directly. The model, unlike some of the estate duty conventions, also provides rules which ensure that a person is not treated as domiciled in both States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I would like now to comment briefly on the two estate duty conventions before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The American convention follows the OECD model in giving sole taxation rights over most categories of property to the country in which the deceased or, in the case of a life-time gift, the transferor was domiciled. As an exception to this general principle, however, the other State may also tax its nationals in accordance with its domestic law, although it will have to give credit for tax charged by the State in which the deceased or transferor was domiciled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained, the Americans have always taken the line in OECD that they were not prepared to give up completely their right to tax their own nationals, and in these circumstances the Government did not consider that it would have been right for the United Kingdom to give up any charge it may have under domestic law on individuals who are domiciled in the United States under the convention but who are United Kingdom nationals. To have done so would have led to a lack of balance in the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the convention is that anyone who is domiciled in the United States and who is not a United Kingdom national will be liable to capital transfer tax only in respect of any immovable property or unincorporated business which he owns in the United Kingdom. The Americans are, of course, similarly restricting their charges over individuals who are domiciled in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will note that this limited taxing right of the country where the individual was not domiciled does not extend to company shares in that country. The Americans particularly asked for this, and although it was a point on which the United Kingdom had reserved its position in the OECD, the other provisions of the convention adequately protect the United Kingdom's interests, and we took the view that this concession—which, of course, is reciprocal—could reasonably be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention provides rules for determining a person's domicile. He is treated as domiciled in the United Kingdom if he is domiciled here under our general law or deemed to be so domiciled under the provisions of section 45 of the Finance Act 1975. He is treated as domiciled in
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the United States if he is regarded as "resident"—which, in effect, means domiciled—in the United States for estate or gift tax purposes, or if he is a national of the United States, and he had been resident there in the previous three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as a result of these rules, a person is domiciled in both States, the convention provides a number of "tie-break" rules. In the main, these follow the OECD model, with the important exception that a national of one State will not be treated as domiciled in the other until he has been resident there in seven out of the previous 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of OECD countries have a comprehensive tax charge—that is, they tax a person's world-wide estate—if a person is merely resident in that country. This means that where an employee is sent to work in such a country, the whole of his estate might become liable to death duties in that country. It seems to us reasonable, however, that there should be some minimum period of residence before a person's estate becomes fully liable to death duties. The "seven out of 10 rule" is unlikely to have any significant effect in relation to the United Kingdom and the United States, as normally neither country will treat people who are merely resident as domiciled for tax purposes. The rule will, however, serve to remove any doubt and it will serve as a useful precedent for other negotiations when the need for some such provision may well be greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may like to know that it will be our policy in other negotiations to seek to include a provision on these lines to help the British business community abroad. I hope that these provisions will be welcome to those whose jobs takes them outside the United Kingdom for a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such individuals would normally remain domiciled in the United Kingdom, and without a provision on these lines the whole of their estates would be liable to tax not only in the United Kingdom but in some cases additionally in the country in which they work. It is far from being the case that United Kingdom taxes are invariably more onerous. For example, spouse transfers will be exempt here but normally taxable in the other country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The Committee will, I think, also welcome the provisions in article 8 of the convention which deal with deductions and, in particular, provide a number of improvements to the reliefs for spouse transfers. The article enables United Kingdom nationals who are not resident in the United States to obtain the benefit of the United States marital deduction, which would not otherwise be available to them. This could be of some benefit to the estate of a United Kingdom national where the United States has a charge under the convention. Under our own law, the only restriction on the exemption for transfers between spouses is where the transferor is domiciled in the United Kingdom and the transferee spouse is not. The exemption is then limited to £25,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope for improving on this without providing an opportunity for tax avoidance is not great. We have however agreed to make two minor improvements for United States taxpayers where our restricted exemption would otherwise apply, in return for the concession the United States have given United Kingdom nationals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the article provides an exemption of up to 50 per cent, where the transferor was domiciled in or a national of the United States. This rule will be of advantage only where the transferor spouse was, under our domestic law, domiciled in the United Kingdom and the transferee spouse was domiciled abroad. Secondly, the article provides for a 50 per cent, exemption where a person domiciled in the United Kingdom leaves a life interest to his or her American spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 also gives the executors of a United Kingdom national who was neither domiciled in nor a national of the United States the option of having the deceased person treated for United States tax purposes as domiciled in the United States, if that produces a lower United States tax charge. The Americans have a different rate scale for non-resident aliens, but this is combined with a lower threshold. Normally the non-resident alien scale would be more favourable than the rate scale applicable to residents and nationals, but there are circumstances where this is not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn briefly to the South African convention. This follows the OECD
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
model more closely than the American convention. It gives the sole right to tax most items of property to the country in which the deceased, or, in the case of a life-time gift, the donor, was domiciled. The other country has the right to tax immovable property and unincorporated businesses situated in its territory, certain ships and aircraft, and company shares and debentures. The country in which the deceased or donor is not domiciled is given subsidiary rights, along the lines envisaged in the commentary to the OECD model, to tax other property where the deceased or donor has been domiciled in that country within 10 years before the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules for determining a person's domicile are similar to those in the American convention, and the Committee will note that again a minimum period of residence in one of the countries has been provided before a person is treated as domiciled there for the purposes of the convention. This provision is likely to have more importance in the South African context because South Africa imposes a comprehensive tax charge on persons who are ordinarily resident in South Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not commented on the provisions of either convention which relate to settled property. These are highly technical and if there are any questions which members of the Committee have about these or other provisions, I shall try at least, to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general these two conventions enable the United Kingdom to retain the right to tax settled property which is has under its own law where the settlor was domiciled in the United Kingdom. In other cases the conventions provide for the United Kingdom charge on settled property to be limited to the specific categories of property mentioned in the conventions. These provisions are consistent with the provisions for dealing with non-settled property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both conventions take account of the changes brought about by the introduction of capital transfer tax. In a number of aspects they improve the reliefs currently available for the relief of double taxation, and I commend the conventions to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could now turn to deal briefly with the Canadian double taxa-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
tion convention which, of course, is an order relating in the main to income. This new convention replaces the existing agreement with Canada dating from 1966. The new convention takes account of changes in each country's tax legislation since the 1966 agreement, and the language is updated to bring it into line with the new model convention published in 1977 by the OECD. I do not propose to give a detailed summary of all the provisions of this order, but I should like to mention briefly the important question of the tax treatment of dividends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treatment proposed for portfolio dividends flowing from the United Kingdom in this order follows that provided for by the dividends articles in other orders which have recently come before the Committee. A tax credit in respect of dividends paid by a United Kingdom company will be given to Canadian portfolio investors, by which I mean individuals who are resident in Canada and companies resident there which control less than 10 per cent, of the voting power in the United Kingdom company paying the dividend. The tax credit is of the same amount as that given to individuals resident in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dividends paid to Canadian investors of this class will be subject to a withholding tax not exceeding 15 per cent, of the aggregate amount of the dividend and the tax credit paid. However, for Canadian direct investors, that is, companies holding more than 10 per cent, of the voting power in the United Kingdom paying company, no part of the United Kingdom tax credit is payable and no United Kingdom withholding tax is charged. For dividends flowing to United Kingdom investors—direct and portfolio—from Canada, as under the existing convention, the rate of Canadian withholding tax is not to exceed 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be seen that the arrangements concerning direct investors differ from those in other recent conventions or protocols in that the Canadian direct investor is not given half of the tax credit to which portfolio investors are entitled. Canada was not prepared to reduce its treaty withholding tax to direct investors resident in the United Kingdom below 15 per cent, and, for that reason, the United Kingdom was unable to offer its half-tax credit concession in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I should also like to mention certain other points of difference between the new convention arrangements and the existing convention arrangements. Under the interest article, reciprocal exemption from tax in the State of source of the interest is now offered if the loan or credit is made, guaranteed or insured respectively by the Canadian Export Development Corporation or the United Kingdom Export Credits Guarantee Department. All interest paid to United Kingdom residents in respect of bonds, debentures and similar obligations by the Government of Canada or by political subdivisions or local authorities is to be exempt from Canadian tax. Under the revised capital gains article, gains made from the disposal of rights and licences and associated assets connected with the exploration and extraction of oil and gas will now be taxable by the State in which the oil and gas is situated. This is important in relation to the United Kingdom oil and gas resources and the associated licensing agreements. The convention conforms to the generally accepted international pattern. I consider it to be fair and properly balanced, and I commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are any questions on any of the conventions, I shall do my best to answer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee is indebted to the Minister of State for the succinct and lucid way in which he has explained three extremely complicated double tax conventions. I am sure that he will be able to answer all the questions that I ask. I know that his speech will repay close examination tomorrow, when maybe other points will occur which we shall take up with him in correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I take up the Minister's invitation to quiz him on one or two points of detail, perhaps I may ask one or two general questions on which, if he catches your eye, Mr. Blenkinsop, he will be able to answer today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to know, for instance, how many more double taxation conventions dealing with capital transfer tax are in the pipeline. We are very pleased that the Government have managed to reach agreement with the United States, at least in this area, where our fiscal systems overlap. It will not be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
necessary for me to raise with the Minister the progress of the other double tax convention, which seems to have become somewhat stalled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the United States double tax convention, I should like to ask when it is likely to be ratified by the Senate. Obviously, in the light of the unfortunate history of the double tax convention relating to profits and income, we should like to be reassured that we shall not be asked to approve the double tax convention if there is any reason whatever to believe that the Senate might go back on it. I do not want to create offence to a friendly Power, but, as I have said, having debated and approved the double tax convention on profits and income and then found that the United States Senate was not quite so warm about it as we were, I think that we need to be reassured that we are not going down that kind of route again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same context, perhaps the Minister will tell us the position of individual States in the United States. I am certainly not informed as to whether they charge any kind of tax on transfers of capital on death or in life-time. If they do, I think that the Committee should know whether those charges would be covered by this double tax convention to any degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as significant detail is concerned, which the Minister explained in broad outline so clearly and admirably, it is important for those who are concerned professionally in this matter, and for others, to look at article 4, dealing with fiscal domicile. Although the Minister made cursory reference to section 45 of the Finance Act 1975, perhaps he could tell us exactly how various deeming provisions in our domestic capital transfer tax legislation will be reconciled with these particular provisions. I noted article 4(3) and 4(4). Does section 45 override these provisions, or is it easily reconcilable with them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, on the question of domicile, article 5(4) deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"property comprised in a settlement."</p></blockquote>
As far as one can see, the relief, or the right to tax—whichever way one regards it—depends to a degree on whether the settlor was domiciled in the United States. It is important for people to know
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
whether the deeming provisions of section 45 will be in point there. How is "domiciled" to be determined in that situation? Is it only by reference to the domestic laws of the United States, or shall we, when considering whether relief should be conceded, apply our own domestic legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the so-called marital deduction in article 8(2) and said that there was no scope for improvement of that relief because of the possibility of avoidance. I shall not ask the Minister to speculate on the form the avoidance might take—I know that he is rather coy about suggesting methods of avoidance to the world outside—but perhaps he would be a little more explicit on that point, because it seems that there is a possibility of hardship here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In more general terms, the United States, as the Minister tells us, has reserved the right to tax its own nationals. Although closer reading of the Minister's speech tomorrow may, perhaps, enlighten me as to how that is to be reconciled with the basic proposition that a country subjects to a capital transfer tax or other equivalent taxes the property only of a person domiciled in that country, could the Minister explain to the Committee exactly how the reconciliation is achieved in this convention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one small point of fact, which I am sure will occasion the Minister no difficulty. Article 4(5) refers to certain possessions of the United States. Could the Minister elaborate on that? Which countries are referred to? Is it just Puerto Rico and Guam or are any other countries affected? In that regard, if the United States covers what I shall call some of its dependent territories, why have Her Majesty's Government not sought to bring in dependent or associated territories?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely informed, Mr. Blenkinsop although you and the rest of the Committee may be, about the precise constitutional position of Puerto Rico and Guam. I do not know whether possibly there is an analogy with, perhaps, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, Hong Kong or Gibraltar. If there is, I wonder whether the Minister raised the question of the people who are domiciled there in his no doubt close-knit negotiations with the United States.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I turn now to the South African convention. I do not want to embarrass the Minister, and I hope that I shall not cause any rift between him and his hon. Friends, but I congratulate him on having had the good sense to realise that there is a need for a convention with South Africa. I hope that he will reassure us that should Her Majesty's Government—the present Government; not any subsequent Government—be seduced into imposing economic sanctions on South Africa, those sanctions would not affect this convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to perhaps less politically contentious points and matters of significant detail, I notice that article 4(4), which deals with fiscal domicile, is not reproduced in the United States tax convention. Article 4(4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) An individual shall not, by virtue of paragraph (2) or (3) of this Article, he deemed to be domiciled at any time in a Contracting State if, under the law of that Contracting State other than its law relating to a tax which is the subject of this Convention, he had ceased to be domiciled in that Contracting State more than three years before that time."</p></blockquote>
As I read that, it means that section 45 of the Finance Act 1975 would not apply except, curiously, in the case of someone who left the shores of the United Kingdom only within the previous three years. If the Minister feels that it is right to exclude the operation of section 45—and I am sure that he does, as we on the Opposition Benches find it a rather unattractive provision, which was scrutinised and will need to be scrutinised closely in the future to make sure that it is not causing injustice—why did he not feel that it was necessary to exclude it in similar situations when a person has left the shores of the United Kingdom for the United States?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to article 9, which is contrary to the general proposition which the Minister set out that, on the whole, only immovable property held by a non-domiciled person should be taxed by either of the contracting parties. I think that there was also one other category. I notice that under article 9, shares and debenture stock
	<br><blockquote><p>"issued by companies incorporated in one of the Contracting States "</p></blockquote>
and "rights of unit holders" may be taxed in that contracting State. That seems to conflict with that general principle, and I would have thought it was
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
a rather undesirable conflict. Perhaps the Minister would care to elaborate on that. Will he also deal with the question of what happens if such shares are held in South Africa by a non-domiciled person—a person not domiciled in South Africa—and, more importantly, perhaps, held by the trustees of a trust that has been set up by someone not domiciled in South Africa at the time, or vice versa. Presumably, the same situation could arise in the United Kingdom. I wonder how that problem should be or has been dealt with. It seems to conflict with the basic principle which the Opposition applaud and would support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot pretend to have done more than scratch the surface of these two highly technical—not to say archaic documents, but it might be for the benefit of the Committee if at least those few questions could be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the Anglo-Canadian double tax convention. In the absence of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), I am rather diffident about raising this point. I recall that the last time we had the occasion to debate various double taxation conventions which purported to cover petroleum revenue tax and development land tax, my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby was in some doubt—he is a prominent member, if not chairman, of a Committee of the House of Commons charged with the consideration of these matters—as to whether Her Majesty's Government were empowered by section 497 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 to negotiate agreements of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that my right hon. Friend would have been present this morning were he still dissatisfied with this point. If the Minister has managed to satisfy him, perhaps he would briefly, for the benefit of the Committee, satisfy us that Her Majesty's Government are empowered to negotiate an agreement of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In broad outline, the agreement follows the many double taxation conventions that we have had to consider, and, indeed, it follows, perhaps not too closely, that negotiated with the United States, which is still rather in limbo. Therefore, I ask the Minister how article 7(4), which deals with business profits, will affect profits that have been taxed on the unitary system
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
which prevails in California and Oregon. Perhaps he could enlighten the Committee as to whether there are any provinces in Canada which have or are contemplating introducing a unitary tax system of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more technical point, I notice that this convention covers entities. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the term 'person' comprises an individual, a company, any entity treated as a unit for tax purposes or any other body of persons".</p></blockquote>
Would the Minister reassure us that a partnership is comprised somewhere in that definition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to article 10(4). There was a very convenient provision in a recent convention which we debated, Mr. Blenkinsop. I do not think that you will recall it becase I do not believe we had the privilege of sitting at your feet on that occasion. It was in the Norway double tax convention, and it equated dividends with everything defined as a distribution under United Kingdom domestic legislation. I thought that that was a rather convenient and practical way because, alas, there may well be what I shall call distributions, which are treated as such by United Kingdom domestic legislation, which may not be the subject of relief under double tax conventions which do not contain this definition section. I notice that the Anglo-Canadian double tax convention does not embody that in article 10(4). Perhaps the Minister will tell us why that is so, and whether he has any plans, either by extra-statutory concession—which I would deprecate—or in any other way, of covering distributions of that kind which might otherwise be comprised in the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that article 11(2) limits the charge that any country may impose to 15 per cent, of the gross amount of interest. Are we to take it from that that interest is to be assimilated to dividends under the Anglo-Canadian double tax convention? If not, what is the underlying rationale of that limitation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is a point which arises not only in this but in other double tax conventions. It might be to the convenience, if not of this Committee, to those of the general public concerned with these matters if the Minister could give us his thoughts as to how interest is to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
established as connected with a permanent establishment. I have had the pleasure of debating various fiscal measures with the Minister of State over the past four or five years. He is apt to say, in a rather deprecating way, that these are all matters for the courts. So, ultimately, they are. But equally, it is always interesting to know what the Government make of their own legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Ogden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Usually, a mess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent comment which could no doubt probably be levelled equally at Liberal Administrations before 1917, Conservative Administrations thereafter and current Labour Administrations. But I think that we should be entitled to ask Ministers what they think the legislation means, even if they are entitled to say that at the end of the day it is more important to know what a court may make of it. Without bowling too fast a bajl—the Minister is so adroit at grading the balls which I bowl to leg—I hope that he will give us his view of how that interesting point might be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to article 17, which deals with relief for pensions and annuities but limits the relief to the greater of 10,000 Canadian dollars or £5,000. I appreciate that with the pressure on Government time it may be that this double tax convention was negotiated before the amendments introduced by the Government in last year's Finance Bill lifted the threshold for taxing golden handshakes. For instance, I recall an interesting debate when the Minister, or one of his right hon. Friends, was induced to lift the limit for golden handshakes when it was appreciated that redundancy payments to steel-workers in the North-East might otherwise be adversely affected. If we as a House thought it right last year to raise the threshold of tax for such matters, I wonder whether it would not be more appropriate to raise the relief under article 17 for pensions and annuities which are comparable. Is it merely that this has been overtaken by events, or have the Government a different view of these questions? If the latter, perhaps the Minister will explain that view to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will forgive my jumping around the articles, but there are a number of unrelated issues.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Going back to article 16, I notice a tendency in recent double tax conventions, particularly in this country and in the United States, to single out artistes and athletes. I do not think that there is any sexual discrimination there. I wonder why that should be. After all, they are usually people who contribute to the general sum of total enjoyment. Why should they be singled out for particularly onerous fiscal treatment? Is it that they are not accorded the measure of trust that the present Government so obviously accord the business man, or is there some deeper and more malevolent reason?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Patronage Seen, tary's representative is always anxious and eager to dispose of business, and I do not wish to detain the Committee, but these are difficult and technical points and I wanted to give the Minister the chance to digest them as I was on my feet. Encouraged by the Whip and, no doubt, yourself, Mr. Blenkinsop, I will merely say that, in outline, the Opposition welcome at least the principles of these conventions. Obviously, we like to see a measure of relief negotiated in this civilised and practical way between Her Majesty's Government and the Governments of these friendly countries. I hope that the Minister will be able to allay our doubts on the one or two small points I have raised. Subject to that, I do not want to detain the Committee any longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I can allay the hon. and learned Gentleman's doubts about the points he has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, on the general question of how many further double taxation conventions in relation to death duties are being negotiated, at the moment we are negotiating with France, Switzerland and Denmark, but I fervently hope that when those conventions come to be ratified, someone else will be standing here to take them through the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall endeavour to oblige.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—in view of the complexity of these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the United States convention, the first question asked was when the Senate would approve the convention. I do not know, and it would be a very
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
brave Minister who said that there was no problem and that the United States was quite happy. I do not think that there will be any problem, and there is not the emotion behind this convention as was the case with the income tax order, in which States' rights were involved. We do not anticipate any difficulty, and the soundings that have been made suggest that there should be no problem in relation to this treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question was in relation to the States themselves and whether there was relief for States' taxes. I understand that some States charge death duties or gifts taxes in certain cases, but this treaty does not touch on that. Indeed, with the experience of the income tax treaty in mind, it is a good thing that it does not do so. This treaty says nothing about States rights to tax. Any State taxation that might fall on estates is outside this treaty and is a Federal tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intei-rupting the Minister. As there is obviously a lacuna there perhaps he could indicate whether it is Her Majesty's Government's practice—and if not, why not—to negotiate conventions with individual States inside a Federal or similar system. If it is not the practice, how does the Minister envisage that relief should be given to a United Kingdom domiciled person for any kind of tax imposed, whether on capital or income, by an individual State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We got into difficulties when we tried to negotiate with States in relation to the income tax convention. We do not normally negotiate in relation to States' rights and States' taxes. We are concerned with Federal rights. We would give unilateral relief in respect of any States' taxes, but they are outside the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third question related to article 4 and to section 45 of the Finance Act 1975. Article 4(1)(b) relates to domicile in the United Kingdom. It states that an individual was domiciled in the United Kingdom
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he was domiciled in the United Kingdom in accordance with the law of the United Kingdom or is treated as so domiciled for the purpose of a tax which is the subject of this Convention."</p></blockquote>
That deems on the provisions of section 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The hon. and learned Gentleman then asked, in relation to article 8(2) of the United States convention, about marital deduction and the scope for avoidance. The problem from the United Kingdom aspect arises from the fact that if one gives the full spouse exemption to transfers between United Kingdom domiciled transferors and non-United Kingdom domiciled transferees, it is possible for the asset to get completely outside the capital transfer tax net. That is why our domestic legislation—the hon. and learned Gentleman will recall the long debates that we had in Committee on this point—restricts the exemption to £25,000. Therefore, when I talk about avoidance in relation to this, it is about the problem that once the property goes into the hands of somebody who is not domiciled, it is fairly easy to get outside the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, in article 8(4), which deals with life interests, we have given an exemption in respect of £50,000 for life interests. That exemption is dependent to some extent on the person not becoming absolutely entitled to the asset. Once a person becomes absolutely entitled to the asset, the exemption is withdrawn retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked how one reconciled the United States' right to tax its own nationals with the domicile provision. The basic principle is that domicile gives rise to a tax charge. The United States has always taxed nationals on a world-wide basis for income tax purposes as well. In view of its insistence on keeping that right, we have said that we wish to tax our nationals, too, on the same basis. If the primary taxing right is on domicile, then there is a subsidiary right in relation to the national. Of course, the country that taxes on a national basis has to give credit to the country that taxes on a domicile basis, because the domicile is the primary right of taxation—subject, of course, to immovable property and some other properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "United States" does not include Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam. I do not think that it is customary to include United Kingdom dependencies. The United States wishes to exclude these three dependencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I turn now to the South African convention. The hon. and learned Gentleman asked me about the three-year period in Article 4(4) and whether this meant the exclusion of section 45. It does mean that. It was put into the South African convention at the request of the South Africans in case we should try to extend the three-year limit in section 45. It is not included in the United States convention because the United States was not too concerned about that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Article 9 in the South African convention, which deals with shares, debentures and unit trusts. The hon. and learned Gentleman asked me why it is different from the United States convention. Again, we reserved our position in the OECD convention regarding shares. We said that we wished to reserve our right to tax shares of companies registered in the United Kingdom. It is in the South African convention for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the United States, it would be quite easy for people domiciled in the United States to form holding companies abroad. This restriction, which we thought would be of benefit to us, would not necessarily help us much in practice, in view of the possibilities open to people to form these holding companies and circumvent the provision. That is why it is not in the United States convention. We were convinced by the Americans' arguments. Basically, we wish to keep that provision in most of our double taxation conventions. They have the same status in the convention as immovable property. If they are in the United Kingdom, they are taxed despite the fact that the person might be domiciled outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Rees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister explain why he was persuaded by the argument advanced by the American Administration, or was that argument not advanced by the South African Administration? Surely the same point must apply. It must be relatively easy for a South African domiciled person to hold his United Kingdom shares, possibly through some foreign investment trust. In the light of that, if he was persuaded in the American case, why not in the South African case, and why stick so rigidly to the OECD model?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sticking to our reservation on the OECD model. I do not know whether the South Africans are really concerned about this. It may be that their internal law makes it more difficult for them to take advantage and form companies in third countries. In the United States it is probably easier to do so. I would not like to say that that is the real reason, because I do not know. However, the United States made a point of this and we felt, because of other provisions in the treaty, that we could concede.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the Canadian convention, the first question was a general one in relation to the point raised elsewhere by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) regarding the taxes that could be included. I understand, although I was not present at the meeting, that the right hon. Gentleman—the Chairman of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments (Joint Committee)—recently had a meeting with the Inland Revenue, and that the Inland Revenue had written to him. I understand—again, this is third hand—that he is satisfied with the explanation which I gave at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 7(4) of the Canadian treaty, I believe that in Canada there is no provision for a unitary system of charging—in the same way as we have had problems in regard to California. The word "entity" will cover a partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 10(4), in regard to dividends, I was asked why they are not equated with the wider term "distribution", or included in it. The definition used by the Canadian convention follows that in the OECD model agreement. Again, both sides were content. The definition includes income treated as dividends under the tax law of the State in which the paying company is resident. I do not know whether that helps the hon. and learned Gentleman very much, but these matters often depend, as he no doubt appreciates, on negotiation. That is why we are happy with the definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards article 11(2), interest is treated as gross, in the same way as dividends, and subject to a withholding tax not exceeding 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question was how interest was connected with permament establishment. I shall not give the standard answer that
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
"It is for the courts to decide". If the hon. and learned Gentleman gives me a particular case, I will give him an answer. I am sure that he appreciates that it depends on each case, and he would not want me to mislead the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to article 17, on pensions. Pensions are normally taxed by the resident country and not the source country. The Canadians have, apparently, very generous pension arrangements whereby they give a considerable tax deduction for contributions made. They feel that because of these arrangements, which are more generous than those in other countries, they should retain some right to tax the pension when it comes out at the other end. We negotiated with them that over and above £5,000, the source country—in this case, Canada—would have the right to tax, but that total tax would be limited to the tax that would be payable if the resident country taxed the pension. That does not mean that any more tax is paid, but the Canadians get a cut of the tax which they would not otherwise receive because of their pension provisions. We thought that to be only fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On article 16, the hon. and learned Gentleman asked about artistes and athletes. I believe I have already given that answer. They are fairly peripatetic individuals. They carry their property with them and present taxation problems as regards domicile and moving from one country to another. That is why they are specifically covered in these conventions. Again, this is probably in the OECD model convention. It is not a case of getting at them, but they are in a different position from that of other people in that their property is tangible, movable property which they can take anywhere in the world and this presents difficulties as regards taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with most of the hon. and learned Gentleman's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
