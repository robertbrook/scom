	<div class='legislation'>Draft International Monetary Fund (Increase in Subscription) Order 1990</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. John Maples)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft International Monetary Fund (Increase in Subscription) Order 1990.</p></blockquote>
I can confidently say that this will not be the longest or most complicated order that a Committee will have to consider during this Session, and I hope that our proceedings will not be long. I am sure, Mr. Hill, that your enjoyment in chairing the Committee will be inversely proportional to how long we take to consider the measure that is before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order authorises an increase in the United Kingdom's subscription to the fund of SDR 1·2 billion, from nearly SDR 6·2 billion to just over SDR 7·4 billion. The increase is part of a general increase in quotas which has been agreed by the International Monetary Fund's board of governors. Overall, quotas have been increased by 50 per cent. from SDR 90 billion to SDR 135 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 1(2) of the International Monetary Fund Act 1979 provides that the order will be considered by the House in draft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I explain briefly what quotas are and how they are increased. I shall discuss also the strengthened measures planned to deal with members of the fund which are in arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quotas are members' subscriptions to the IMF, financed from their reserves. They are also important, for borrowing countries, and indeed for creditors, in putting ceilings on any lending that the IMF makes to individual members. Under its articles of agreement, the IMF is obliged to review its quotas every five years—though the present review, the ninth, has taken longer than usual to complete. The proposed new quotas are the result of the latest review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new quotas were arrived at in the following manner: 60 per cent. of the overall increase has been distributed among all members in proportion to the quotas that members have at present—known in fund jargon as actual quotas—while the remaining 40 per cent. has been distributed in proportion to each member's share in the total of calculated quotas, the quotas that broadly reflect members' current relative positions in the world economy. For historical reasons, actual and calculated quotas differ, though over time the fund hopes to bring them into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is not the end of the matter, because the methods used at successive reviews for adjusting IMF quotas—applied in a uniform way to all members—mean that members' quotas only gradually change in relation to one another to reflect changing economic circumstances. That uniform approach has the advantages attendant upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
gradual changes in members' relative positions in the IMF. But occasionally some further adjustments are necessary to reflect changing positions in the world economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of the latest review, it was agreed that Japan should move to second place in the fund and that France and the United Kingdom should share fourth place, in that and subsequent quota reviews. The increase in quotas in the order reflects the adjustments necessary to bring about that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quota increase becomes effective when 85 per cent. of members have consented to it and paid the necessary increase in their subscriptions. We hope that the quota increase can be operational before the end of 1991. Fund members have agreed to review progress at the spring meetings if it looks as though that deadline will not be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the IMF's quota review there were also discussions on ensuring that arrears to the fund could be more effectively tackled. That is a serious problem, and is becoming worse. Members in arrears currently owe SDR 3·3 billion to the fund. A range of measures has been adopted to encourage those members to become current again and, where they refuse to co-operate, to allow the fund to apply the appropriate sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For co-operating countries, the strengthened measures centre on the notion of accruing "rights" to fund finance. If the member in arrears devises, with the fund's help, and implements, a programme of economic reform, the member can earn a right to future fund financing. Such financing will be available only after the arrears are cleared and the member has demonstrated that the programme has been followed over a period, with measurable results. It is envisaged that that period would normally be about three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For countries which have not agreed to co-operate in clearing their arrears, the board of governors has proposed that the fund should have the power to suspend members which are not fulfilling their obligations. The suspension of a member would result in that member losing its voting and representation rights in the IMF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important part of the arrears strategy and requires the IMF's articles of agreement to be amended, by a 85 per cent. majority. A Command Paper will be presented to the House tomorrow that will explain that amendment. The board of governors agreed at the spring meetings that the quota increase would not be implemented until the suspension amendment had also been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fund members have to take the necessary action to allow them to vote for the amendment. For some countries, such as the United States, the legislation is needed. For others such as the United Kingdom, existing powers are sufficient. We believe that the amendment is important in providing the IMF with the powers to deal effectively with members which make no effort to resolve their arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the draft order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.35 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming the Economic Secretary to his post. This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of debating with him in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support an increase in actual contribution but a reduced relative contribution to the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund; therefore, I would not wish to divide the Committee. However, several questions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
need to be asked, the first of which is a technical question about our contribution in relation to our public expenditure profile. The Economic Secretary said that the contribution comes from our reserves, but what is its position within our public expenditure plans? Is it simply a call on the contingency, or is it specifically budgeted for by the public expenditure survey committee? It would be interesting to know how the Government carry out their own accounting for the substantial contribution that we make to the special drawing rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is important to consider the relative standing of the various contributions of the countries to the IMF. In the 1990 reformulation, the overall increase in contributions world-wide is about 50 per cent. However, the United Kingdom's standing within the league table of contributions has fallen; in 1980 and 1983 we were in second place, but it is now proposed that we fall to fourth equal place. The diminution in our standing among the G7 contributions is understandable—our economic performance during the past 10 years, as we have frequently said, has not matched the claims that the Government have sought to make. It is interesting to note that at the same time that the Government were claiming that Britain had experienced an economic miracle and had equalled or surpassed the economic performance of West Germany and Japan, they were agreeing with the IMF that our economic standing had fallen below that of Germany and Japan. That is clear and incontrovertible evidence of the relative economic decline of Britain in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, none the less, to ask whether the quotas and ranking within the list of G7 countries is accurate—even now. Top of the list of contributors is the United States. That is right and proper as it is the strongest economy in the world. It contributes three-and-a-half times that of the United Kingdom, even under the proposed realignment. The United States is way out in front, making the largest contribution. Equal second are Germany and Japan. They, rightly, are seen as being the two other strongest economies in the world, but, even so, their contribution, in each case, is only one third of that of the United States. That does not reflect the balance of strength between their economies. The British and French contributions, at fourth equal, are only a short way behind those of Germany and Japan. The gap between Germany and Japan with SDR 8,241 million, and the United Kingdom and France with SDR 7,414 million, does not reflect accurately the relative strength of those economies. Italy is sixth on the list and will contribute only SDR 4,590 million. Again, that seems to be a surprising assessment of relative positions among the world economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relative terms, it is true to say that what is now being proposed is a better reflection of relative economic strengths than existed in either 1980 or 1983. None the less, there is still room for greater accuracy of assessment of relative strength. The United Kingdom economy is currently not on equal strength to the French economy, nor is it almost twice as strong as the economy of Italy. We must ask the Government to explain what further steps will be taken to ensure that the figures will, gradually, reflect more accurately the relative performance of the different member countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are technical reasons why the rules of IMF subsciption limit the scope for dramatic changes. I understand that 60 per cent. of the overall increase is allocated according to existing quotas, while 40 per cent. is
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
distributed according to each member's share in the new calculated quotas, which are based on an assessment of five economic indicators, rather than the old system of 10 Bretton Woods indicators. That split in the recalculation limits the scope available in the system for dramatic increases in a particular contribution. It would be useful to know whether the Government are pressing for further changes to continue the direction of change that is enshrined in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government satisfied that the five factors in the new calculation of the quotas provide an accurate assessment of the relative strengths of the economies? Those five items in the formula consist of gross domestic product, monthly reserves, current payments, current receipts and fluctuation in receipts. It would be useful to know whether the Government regard those as reliable indicators of underlying economic strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as asking about the calculation of the formulae and the relative standing of the different economies involved, the other major question is what will the IMF do with the additional funds that are being acquired by the increases in special drawing rights? There will be an overall 50 per cent. increase in the total of SDRs available to the IMF, and we should be asking about the reason for that increase.

It appears from the documents that the principal aim is to assist new emerging democracies, which we in the Opposition welcome, but that raises some questions. For example, what will be the interchange between the activities of the IMF in relation to the new democracies in eastern Europe with the activities of the European bank for reconstruction and development, which has a specific role for capital investment in eastern and central European countries? Will the IMF and the bank be acting in concert; will they be liaising their activities; and what will be our relative contributions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that in the concentration on support for eastern Europe, the IMF will not forget its responsibilities to development in the third world. There has been a tendency in the past year to concentrate all our attention on the new democracies in the east and to forget the many struggling economies and peoples in the south of our world. I hope that their problems will continue to be recognised by the IMF in an increasingly sympathetic light. The problems of many of the less-developed countries have been intensified by the high-interest-rate policies of the 1980s in much of the developed world. That problem looks set to worsen, especially if Germany raises its interest rates in the near future in response to the absorption of what was East Germany into the German economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What steps are being taken to ensure that when the IMF examines the development needs of the third world, it considers not only monetary issues, which it has tended to do to the exclusion of everything else in assessing the development needs of the countries that it decides to support? What pressure will the Government bring to bear on the IMF to ensure that it does consider factors such as infrastructures and environmental concerns? Surely it is axiomatic that good health care, educational opportunities and protection of the environment are important in sustaining a developing economy, as well as the purely monetary issues on which the IMF has tended to concentrate. It is not good enough to examine only the figures on money supply and fiscal rigour. The basic fundamentals of the economy, especially matters such as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
education, must be understood and tackled. We keep pressing the Government on such matters in our own economy, and those are doubly important to the development of third world countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have any specific objections to the order, but we should be told where further contributions will be directed and what representations the Government are making within the councils of the IMF about the use to which the funds will be put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) talked about not dividing the Committee. I am rather amused because we can divide only on the Question of whether or not we have considered the statutory instrument. If we say that we have not, we nevertheless have; and if even if we say that we have not, it is reported to the House that we have. It is an abstract and obscure procedure, it merely provides an opportunity to explore the subjects raised by statutory instruments.

The IMF will have plenty to do, especially because of what has happened in eastern Europe. Economic progress must underpin the development of democracy in eastern Europe, but that development will founder if the economies of those countries fail. The IMF is likely to be involved in many of those enonomies as well as with its third world responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury spoke about the role of the European bank for reconstructing and development and whether it would overlap with the work of the fund. The ERD's contrubution is a drop in the ocean when it is compared with the problems of eastern Europe. It can provide only a tiny amount of the capital that will be required, and if it pursues its policy of trying to retain its triple A rating, it will be even more circumscribed in what it does. The work of the IMF will not be reduced or less necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the relative contributions of the various countries, it is important that we continue to encourage Japan to take the scale of international responsibility that goes with its economic power and status. Japan has not been quick to undertake that responsibility in relation to its aid to developing countries, for example. That is because of the inhibitions of the post-war years and how the West told Japan to get on with its peaceful reconstruction and to stay out of international affairs. It should be recognised that Japan's economic power now carries responsibilities. That is recognised by Japan's leaders, but that there is still a gap is illustrated by the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's policy on Germany's contributions? It could be argued that its contributions should increase to reflect its economic power. But the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr Ridley) does not like Germany's economic power. He assured us only the other day that he had resigned from the Goverment because he was in full accord with Government policy on that and other matters, and that if Germany tried too hard to increase its contributions it might be accused of throwing its economic weight about. I do not share that view. I welcome Germany's peaceful economic success, but it, too, must carry the international responsibilities that go with that success, among which is an appropriate ranking in its contributions to the IMF.

Britain seems sometimes like someone in slightly reduced circumstances who persists in paying the full town membership of several London clubs but who is not quite able to afford it. We must take our share of the responsibilities. I look for the day when we are closer to the top rank by virtue of our economic success, but our contribution has to reflect our real economic position. I am not sure whether the same is true of our overseas aid, where we can adopt a more generous policy, but our contribution to the important work of the IMF should reflect our real economic position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury raised five points. He asked whether the measure would have any effect on public spending; and the answer is no. The IMF quotas are fulfilled by using part of one's reserves. We give 75 per cent, in our own currency and 25 per cent, in SDRs, which the IMF immediately re-deposits with the Bank of England at zero interest. Therefore, there is no charge on our reserves and no implication for public spending. There is, of course, a potential contingent liability, although that has never been called.

I am interested in the attempts that have been made to maintain the fiction that the United Kingdom's economy has contracted over the past 10 years. In fact, the United Kingdom fell behind Germany and Japan a very long time ago. It didnot fall by any measure of size or strength behind Germany and Japan during the 1980s. During the 1980s we actually closed the gap with Germany and France, and our ranking is the same as that of France, though our contribution would have been slightly greater had it been based on our calculated quota.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary is saying that in the past 10 years we have closed the gap with Germany and France. What are the criteria that he is using? An examination of our balance-of-payments performance, for example, suggests precisely the reverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the rate of economic growth. That is a well-known statistic, though one about which the hon. Gentleman's party has some understandable amnesia. With the possible exception of Spain, the United Kingdom economy was on top of the European growth league during the 1980s. We have not completely closed the gap, but our gross domestic product is much the same as that of France, and the difference in GDP per head between France and Germany on the one hand and us on the other shows that we have made a considerable impact on closing the gap over the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rankings are not intended to be entirely accurate. The calculations are not the only way to consider relative economic strength. The hon. Member for Islington, South
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
and Finsbury said that five factors are taken into account to produce the rankings. They amount to a reasonable indicator of relative economic strength. I agree, however, that there are perhaps some anomalies in the way that the rankings turn out. But they clearly leave the United States at the top, with West Germany and Japan close to each other, and the United Kingdom and France also close to each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the United Kingdom's contribution were actually based on those calculated quotas, it would be slightly—though not very much—greater than France's. It would be 5·09 per cent., instead of 4·99 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom scores well on reserves, the state of public sector finances and the rate of economic growth. We do not score as well as many other countries on our balance of payments performance—though we do as well as one or two. The United States has far worse balance of payments problems than we do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary must know that in terms of percentage of GDP our balance of payments deficit is greater than that of the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr Maples</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem with the United States balance of payments deficit is its overall enormous size.

The hon. Gentleman asked what the IMF will do with the money. After the ninth quota review the IMF will have the equivalent resources of about SDR 40 billion—about £30 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to the hon. Gentlemen's point about the third world, the IMF has a slightly different role to that of the aid organisations. The World Bank and its subsidiaries and associated bodies help to finance development in the third world. The IMF has always been a monetary institution and its financing has always been balance of payments related and short term. We think it important that it should stay like that, though that does not mean that it should not pay attendtion to the third world—it does and it will continue to do so. It is doing quite a lot for eastern Europe, and already has agreements with Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia. Its function will continue to be to try to advise those countries on how to make the adjustment to a freer, free market-type of economy from the centrally planned economies that they have, and if such programmes are put in place, to make balance of payments financing available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
There are soft-loan facilities available from the IMF to third world countries. There is the structural adjustment facility and the enhanced structural adjustment facility, where the interest rates are fairly concessionary. The United Kingdom is the largest donor to the interest rates subsidies in the enhanced structural adjustment facility programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said that the IMF tends to consider money factors only. I repeat that its job is to help countries to make structural adjustments to their economies and to offer balance-ofpayments financing. The IMF will continue to take account of environmental issues in the programmes that it helps borrowing countries to put into place. We in the developed world know that such matters cannot be left entirely to the third world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development of infrastructure and education must have due weight in a borrowing country's public spending plans, but when loans for such matters are needed, the IMF is not the organisation from which a borrowing country should seek help. The aid organisations offer assistance for such programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European bank for reconstruction and development is a valuable institution. The hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed referred to a drop in the ocean, but we are talking about quite a lot of money. The United Kingdom has an 8½ per cent. share, which is about 10 billion ecu—£14 billion—that is available in capital. It will be able to perform a valuable development function in helping to restructure and develop eastern European economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with both the honourable Members for Islington, South and Finsbury and for Berwick-upon-Tweed that although the development of eastern Europe is extremely important, we should not forget the third world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
