	<p>[MR. MICHAEL J. MARTIN 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Licensed Betting Office
<br><br><!-- lb --> (Amendment) Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Licensed Betting Offices (Amendment) Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 51).</p></blockquote>
It is a travesty that a measure of such importance, which will affect the livelihoods of so many, should come before the House as a statutory instrument. That is an affront to democracy. However, this is not the time to discuss how to democratise Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations relate to the extension of the hours of betting offices. The subject first came to my attention not because I have a long-term interest in the industry or in gambling, but when, out of the blue, many people who work in betting shops and betting shop managers telephoned me to ask what Parliament could do to help them. Their employers had stuck under their noses contracts extending their hours of work, with the accompanying threat that if they did not sign they would be dismissed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That happened before there was an inkling in Parliament that the opening hours of betting shops were to be extended. There must have been collusion between the Government and the big three bookies to tip them off that the regulations were being introduced. Action was being taken before the will of Parliament was tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that when individuals were given the choice of the sack or working longer hours, most, reluctantly, signed the contract. But surveys carried out be people in the industry found that 97 per cent. of staff who work in betting shops said no to opening longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition feel that the thuggery of the big three bookies—Ladbrokes, Coral and William Hill—is completely unacceptable. I take no pleasure in nominating William Hill as the winner of bookies' bully of the year for insisting that individuals sign a new contract on pain of dismissal. The industry has struggled with its somewhat seedy image; it has dubious overtones and has been accused of intimidation in certain areas. This latest episode has done no favours to the image of the bookmaker or of racing. That is another reason why the thousands of people who earn a straightforward, honest and reasonable living from the industry should oppose the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are lessons to be learnt for the Sunday trading issue. Many people currently working willingly at checkouts on Sunday afternoons for reasonable pay may, in a year or so, be forced by unscrupulous employers to work on Sundays. I shall not debate that now, but it is a warning to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The betting industry has been consistently anti-trade union; it has forced out the trade unions and even the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
staff councils that were set up are in decline. We should beware of employers who gain the upper hand in that way and behave in an unrestrained, non-self-regulating manner. We should learn the lessons for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the regulations affect staff? Many of those workers are women and if they are forced by the strong-arm tactics of the large firms to work late in the evening, their social lives and, above all, their family lives will inevitably be severely affected. I should like to read one of the many letters complaining about the treatment meted out to staff by the big bookies. We have all received letters from peiple who will be profoundly affected by the regulations if they are accepted. This letter is from 
	<i>The Racing Post</i> of 22 January 1993:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am a betting shop cashier and have been told I will get the sack if I don't sign my new agreement to do night racing.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I told my boss that I was willing to work late one night a week but could do no more, as I have a handicapped son with cerebral palsy who cannot cook for himself. But the company expect me to work four or five nights a week.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As you see, 12 years' service means nothing and I am just one of many who will be looking for a job in April."</p></blockquote>
I can show the Committee many such letters from people who have given the industry long, loyal service. In these days of rising crime, staff and punters who leave betting shops late at night will face greater threats to their personal safety from muggers and other criminals. Betting shop staff often work in twos or threes, and late at night they will be a target for casual thieves and robbers. If people have a drink or two late in the evening and then go to the betting shop, that will be a recipe for further problems. With the streets quiet at night, staff going home after closing time will be very vulnerable to armed robbers and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that many of the licensed betting offices were granted their licenses under a previous regime by local licensing authorities and magistrates committees. Premises were licensed on the basis of existing opening hours, which are now to be amended. What would have been the view of those licensing authorities had they realised that the hours would be extended until 10 o'clock? Can the Minister shed some light on that? I suspect that those licensing authorities would have been influenced by representations from local people and from the people who work in the industry and they would have granted fewer licences. Having established a foothold, betting offices are going further than expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Gerrard 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Walthamstow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to my hon. Friend, who has a track in his constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the same applies to planning permission? Local authorities gave planning permission for betting shops on the presumption that they would operate at certain hours. Betting shops are often in residential areas or on the corner of residential streets. The local authority and residents might have had a different attitude had they known that the opening hours would be extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his experience, my hon. Friend highlights a valuable point. I do not believe that local authorities would have made some of their decisions had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
they realised that such a creeping extension of hours would occur. I do not know if such issues can be subject to review. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on the technical nature of the decisions that could be taken by planning authorities and local betting licensing authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another profound effect of the regulation will be evening off-course betting, producing a sharp drop in attendances at race meetings. People who run courses for the big three will not be affected by that because they will get their income from the book makers rather than through attendances on the gate. The only people who will be severely affected by such a change in the regulations are those who depend on gate money. Fewer and fewer people will go through the gate to watch the race if they can go to the warmth of their local betting office to watch televised races from other courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Etherington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sunderland, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend make a statement about areas where betting shops are to be found among people's houses? Betting shops are not only in town centres, they are in villages, in outlying estates and so on. Already, young people congregate around betting shops during the day and there is the problem of their being at a loose end in the evening. The quality of life of people living in such areas would not be improved by the additional opening hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an extremely valid point, a point which the Secretary of State made himself. It is a moral question of whether we should further encourage gambling. The Home Secretary soon reversed his position—no doubt for reasons that I shall later discuss. His concern about the effects of extending the availability of gambling evaporated quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tracks are dependent on gate revenue for their existence. About 10,000 people who are employed in the greyhound industry may find their jobs at risk because of the change in the hours. In future, those employees will not be able to survive because punters will not be coming in through the gate, but will be staying at the betting shops and watching races on television.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wholly unfamiliar with this subject, but if I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, he is endorsing a long-held view of mine: if something is intrinsically boring, only betting makes it at all interesting. Is he saying that people go to the races not to watch, but to bet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People can bet either at the course or in a betting office. People who can bet in the warmth of a betting office will do so, perhaps to the exclusion of attending a race meeting. The tracks that do not live by television revenues are those not owned by the big three bookmakers, and they will suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Meale 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mansfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend should remind the hon. Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) that more people go greyhound racing than go horse racing. None of the many millions of people who go greyhound racing would describe their sport as boring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be the last person in the Committee to disagree with my hon. Friend, as his knowledge far outweighs that of all the other hon. Members in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Room. He is able to communicate to hon. Members of all parties the interest and excitement that he gains from greyhound racing, and his concern for the future of the sport has motivated him to campaign long and hard as the secretary of the all-party greyhound committee in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another helpful source of information has been the vice-chairman of the Scottish Bookmakers Protection Association, who said that there need be only a 15 per cent. fall in attendance to close 50 per cent. of existing tracks. I hope that that answers the question of the hon. Member for Mid-Kent. A monopoly is being created by Government action. It masquerades under the buzz words of freedom and choice, but the people who work in the industry and those who run independent stadiums enjoy neither. Those words mask the Government's move to make the industry a monopoly in the pockets of the big three bookies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure's employment costs do not stop there. The independent bookmakers will not be able to afford the additional overheads for non-social working hours. I am glad to say that many of them are loth to employ William Hill-style bully-boy tactics on their staff. They will be squeezed out of business. I should be amazed if hon. Members of all parties had not received representations from local independent bookmakers about the effect that the regulations will have on them. The British Betting Office Association estimates that about 2,000 independent shops may be forced to close, with concomitant job losses. The grip of the big three bookmakers will be strengthened at the expense of the independent bookmakers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Esher)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, although I know that his sport is cricket, not greyhound racing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a friend on the cricket pitch, although I am not sure that betting shops would take much interest in our antics. However, Sandown racecourse is in my constituency, and I would welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments about the effects of the regulations on the racing industry. That industry also employs many people, and its representatives have welcomed the measure. The Jockey Club said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The racing industry will benefit from this relaxation in the betting regulations as it will increase the number of leviable bets and so increase the amount of income going to the industry by way of the Levy."</p></blockquote>
Those sentiments are supported by the Horseracing Advisory Council, the National Trainers Federation and the Racecourse Association. Those are all influential bodies, and the racing industry could do with the boost that the measure will supply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that those bodies are keen on the proposal. Its impact on their revenues will be marginal, but positive. However, every bet placed on horse races generates income for the horse racing industry. I hope that Conservative Members would wish to be evenhanded with the greyhound racing industry, for which not a penny is generated when a bet is placed on a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
greyhound race. In horse racing, the levy returns to the Exchequer to be diverted to the Horserace Betting Levy Board. In greyhound racing, the bookies collect the money that is set aside for the levy, but it is not transferred back to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister has studied the report of the Select Committee on Home Affairs. It recommends that an additional sum, equivalent to that received by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, is given to the greyhound industry. I hope that he will promote proposals that would provide extra income for the greyhound industry through additional bets placed in the evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:
Let me add, for accuracy, that it is not true that dog racing receives nothing from the turnover of betting shops. It will receive its share of the reduction in betting tax that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the last Budget. I appreciate that that falls shorts of a levy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the horse race betting levy generates £40 million for the industry. If a similar arrangement applied to the greyhound industry, it would receive approximately £11 million. If it is good enough for the Jockey Club and other friends of the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Taylor) to get a cut from betting, it is good enough for people in the greyhound racing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend should emphasise that the Opposition would be grateful if the Minister informed the Committee today, or the House as soon as possible, how much money the bookmakers have already paid through the cut announced in last year's Budget. I believe that no money has been paid so far, yet the announcement was made almost a year ago. Although arrangements have been made, meetings have taken place and boards have been set up, nothing has been paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to the Minister to enable him to answer that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to the point, which is not directly germane to the evening opening of betting shops but is relevant to the point that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangement is voluntary. It is not for the Home Office to know or pass on information. Occasionally, I am told about the progress of negotiations. It is difficult to achieve agreement between the bookmakers and the dog racing industry. They have been persuaded to set up a committee to administer resources. The money that was raised through the decision of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will go towards the right causes in dog racing. However, that is a matter not for the Home Office but for the two industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) is mistaken in his interpretation of the Select Committee on Home Affairs' report. It considers how the dog racing industry might be helped. Paragraph 57 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not see a statistical levy as the best mechanism by which to achieve this goal."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet paragraph 33 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If off-course bookmakers were to pay greyhound racing a similar percentage of turnover as they contribute to horseracing, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
greyhound racing industry could expect to receive around £11.7m. At present off-course bookmakers pay less than £4m in total. A new representative body, in negotiating a charge to the bookmakers for supplying the product on behalf of all the tracks, would be able to work towards the narrowing of this gap."</p></blockquote>
The Government have not responded positively to that recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The recommendation of the Select Committee on Home Affairs was dependent on a body being established and the guarantees that he has just outlined being forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must make it clear that there are arguments in favour of a voluntary levy but it must, of course, be agreed by both sides. The Select Committee was clear it stated that whatever help may be given to the greyhound industry, it did not envisage that it would be by means of a statutory levy. The Government could impose a levy only by statute, and the Select Committee expressly advised against that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn into a discussion of the ideology of the free market, but if the Government chose to intervene, rather than to impose, and tried to assist the industry, they could show that they wanted certain things to happen. Introducing a measure that—to use a greyhound analogy—rolls over so that it can have its stomach tickled by the big three bookies is hardly the way to bring fairness to the industry; nor is driving out thousands of independent bookmakers and course owners. The Government's proposals will not lead to the big bookies responding to allow additional funds to be available to the industry. I cannot help the Minister to decide how to do that job, but I can tell him that the way he is doing it at present will not run with the big bookmakers. They think that the Government are a pushover and the regulations underline why they hold that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why the regulations were introduced at all is a puzzle. It was not to increase competition or to help small business, as they do neither. They create a monopoly and penalise many small businesses. The regulations will force countless small and independent bookmakers to the wall while disproportionately benefiting the big three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few betting shops are open in the evening in Northern Ireland where that is already legal. The only places that remain open are where big bookmakers have put the squeeze on the small bookmaker and forced them out of businesses. Then they change their hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure was not introduced to help the racing industry. Most betting is likely to be on greyhound racing from the big three's five stadiums. Although a full betting levy is collected from punters, as we said earlier, it is not passed back to the industry as happens in the horse racing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure cannot have been introduced as a result of public demand. Many people in the industry are staggered at the effrontery of the Home Secretary's press release, which said that it was a response to demand in the industry. Only five out of 199 responses by the public to the Home Office consultative paper were in favour of the proposal. The overwhelming opinion throughout the industry was against these unjustifiable regulations—including 96 per cent. of independent bookmakers.

I do not know why the Government have introduced the regulations. The big bookies were tipped off well before Members of Parliament. I can do no better than quote the press release issued by the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A shady deal has been struck."</p></blockquote>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the article by the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) in the

	<br><blockquote><p>"Big bookies collect their winnings".</p></blockquote>
The essence of the article was that the Conservative party was somehow paying off an investment that Ladbrokes had made before the election. The first sentence of the article stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ladbrokes' investment in the Conservative party is certainly proving sound."</p></blockquote>
I have corresponded with Ladbrokes recently and received a letter from Mr. Cyril Stein, the chief executive. The letterhead gives one of the company's directors as the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, West (Mr. Janner). Does the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has a reputation to retrieve, given the press release that he issued. To say that a shady deal has been struck did not answer my question. What was the deal? What did the Conservative party gain from bringing forward the regulations? However, I take the point about Members' interests. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) has a little list. I should be pleased, Mr. Martin, to read into the record some of the connections between Conservative Members and the horse racing industry, but I see from your expression that you would rule me out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not that, but it would not be courteous to make those comments if the hon. Members involved were not present. Courtesy requires that hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must correct my hon. Friend. That company did better than that. It was a flagship of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
economic revival claimed by the former right hon. Member for Finchley, who is now, God rest her, in another place. However, that is a little wide of the mark. I do not wish to embarrass Conservative Members with their connections with some, albeit failed, areas of the leisure industry; nor, in view of your admonition, Mr. Martin, will I read into the record either the list of Conservative Members who have connections with the racing industry or the list of interests registered by some members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the consultation advice received by the Home Office and referred to in parliamentary questions from the hon. Member for Stockton, South and other hon. Members makes it clear that there is not an overwhelming demand to change the hours. On the contrary, the demand is to keep the hours as they are. The other reasons for the Government's cave-in to the big three must be examined further, but there is no demand for the change and it insults the intelligence of the industry and the Committee to maintain otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is a tribute to the arrogance and unaccountability of Government in general—and of this Conservative Government in particular—and to the unconfined greed displayed by the big three bookies. An even fatter monopoly is being created. It is against the interests of the people who work in the industry, of racegoers and of punters. Until adequate safeguards are introduced, Opposition Members will oppose the regulations and will vote against their consideration today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Devlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a member of the Committee, and I am grateful to you, Mr. Martin, for calling me to speak. I have no interest to declare, not being a director of any business related to racing or having any other connection with it. I question the decision of the Home Office to extend the opening hours of betting shops from 6.30 pm to 10 pm. That follows an extensive consultation process, which has been going on since 1991 following the Rothschild royal commission. On balance, that commission was against evening opening. Its primary concerns were the potential for illegal betting, the incentive for excessive gambling and the damage to the greyhound racing industry. It found little public desire for evening opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's consultation paper makes it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The large off-course bookmaking companies regard evening opening as an opportunity to generate additional profit."</p></blockquote>
Hitherto the Government's policy on gambling has had two main premises: first, that people should be allowed to gamble if they want to, and secondly, that demand for gambling should not be stimulated. Those seem admirably well designed to maintain a balance between individual liberty and the public interest and welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation paper cited the main objections to evening opening hours as:

	<ol>

	<li>"the additional costs for (especially) smaller betting offices;</li>

	<li>the effect on hours of work for staff in betting shops:</li>

	<li>the effect on on-course bookmakers: and</li>

	<li>the adverse effect on greyhound racing."</li>
</ol>
On item 2, it was said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In relation to staff employed in Betting Offices, any changes to their conditions of service as a result of evening opening would be a matter for negotiation between them and their employer".</p></blockquote>
On item 4, it was said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a matter on which the Government would welcome the detailed views of the greyhound and bookmaking industries".</p></blockquote>
In October and November 1992, before consultation was complete, William Hill and Ladbrokes began to make wholesale changes of all employee contracts to cater for evening opening hours. Early that month, William Hill wrote to all its staff in these terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The company believes that legislation will permit us to open our shops to cover evening racing and that the likely date when this change will be implemented will be April 1993."</p></blockquote>
When these letters were handed out, staff were told that if they did not sign they would have to "leave the industry". Ladbrokes has employed the same tactics with its staff. Revised, wholly unreasonable contracts are to come into effect on 15 April 1993, and staff were advised in November that
	<br><blockquote><p>"failure to sign the revised contract after full consultation will regrettably result in those individuals being given notice to terminate their existing contract".</p></blockquote>
Coral has done the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked employees in the industry about consultation. I told them to write to their Members of Parliament and I tabled several parliamentary questions on 17 December about the consultation process. They were answered on 11 January, when I learnt, incredibly, that 824 representations were received of which 775 were against and 49 in favour; that three petitions of more than 2,000 signatures were received opposing evening opening; and that, of 199 representations from members of the public, only five were in favour and 194 were against. A survey of bookmakers by A. R. Dennis showed that of the 475 who took part, 439 opposed evening opening. Of 4,167 staff consulted, an overwhelming 4,046 opposed evening opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Bookmakers has declared itself to be against an extension. In addition, the general purposes committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers advised the Home Office in late 1991 of its concerns about the safety of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, let us consider the remarkable decision by the Home Office to allow evening opening. What are the reasons? What is the justification? As a result of my parliamentary questions, the strength of feeling against any extension is on the public record. Since I tabled those questions, I have received scores of letters from across the country complaining at the way in which people have been treated by the big three companies in their eagerness to prepare for this eventuality—in spite of the Home Office assurances given on 11 January by the Minister that whatever contingency plans Ladbrokes and others may be making, no decision has been or will be conveyed to them in advance of a public announcement. Why then did Ladbrokes, Coral and Hill go to so much effort and pain unless—as they say in letters to their staff—they knew that the decision was to be made in their favour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 19 January, the surprise announcement from the Home Office—more of a surprise to some than to others, it seems—stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over 800 representations and a number of petitions have since been received…In the light of the consultation process"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Note, in the light of it, not in spite of it—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have decided that evening opening should be allowed until 10 pm on Mondays to Sundays…It is clear that the growth in the number of evening horseraces had created increased consumer demand".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 January 1993: Vol. 217, c. 141.]</p></blockquote>
In fact, the number of evening meetings has increased only from 82 to 88 nights in the past five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most impartial observers would think it strange that a consultation process, in which 97 per cent. of people were opposed to a plan was cited as the reason for approving it. When challenged, the Home Office relies on a Gallup poll conducted for the Betting Office Licensees Association—BOLA—which is dominated by the big three betting shop owners and not, perhaps, the most impartial body. That poll apparently found that 56 per cent. of punters were in favour of late opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps BOLA will explain why that 56 per cent. appeared in its circular letter to MPs as 72 per cent. Perhaps the association might also explain why it sent the survey back to Gallup for re-modelling. Perhaps BOLA will further explain why the study was denied to independent bookmakers who requested it. One gets the impression that there is a lot of explaining to be done. Is it time that Gordon Dennis of A.R. Dennis—the largest independent—resigned from the BOLA council in protest at the way in which the survey was massaged into shape? Will the Minister tell me whether he relied on the survey in making his decision and, if so, why it did not feature in the Home Office press release?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendations of the Home Affairs Select Committee were cited in the Home Office press release. Yet again, there is a significant divergence. The Select Committee called for opening until 9 pm; the Home Office generously offered opening until 10 pm. The Select Committee called for compensation to support greyhound racing and the smaller bookmakers; no such schemes have been set. The Select Committee thought that the arrangement would be voluntary; in fact, it has turned out to be compulsory if people work for Ladbrokes or William Hill. To add insult to injury, those two companies claim that, because 98 per cent. and 99.5 per cent. of their staff have signed new contracts, that shows some level of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with a decision which will create unfair and unnecessary hardship to employees of betting shops, which will damage greyhound racing and reduce the number of indepednent bookmakers—creating a triopoly of the big three who have done so much to secure the decision in their favour—and for which no credible justification has yet been given. The Government are right to say that it is a matter for the employer and the employee to negotiate in their contracts, but it is wrong to ignore a situation in which a decision may be used to bully and cajole people who have no bargaining power. The Home Ofrfice understands that point in relation to Sunday trading, so why ignore it here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new contracts that are being imposed, employees have to be available for work at any time they are asked. No extra money is to be paid for longer, or less sociable hours; no provision is made for meals; and no extra security is offered at night. William Hill's contract states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The company reserves the right to require the employee to work such additional hours over any five days as may be notified to them over and above their contractual hours."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Ladbrokes can vary the number of days, shifts and times of working every week and need not even confine itself to any set number of hours in any one week. The effect on staff will be appalling. Most licensed betting office staff are female and worry about travelling home late. A non-driver staff member living in a village who cannot travel home by public transport after 7 pm was told that that was "tough" and that she would have to take a taxi at her own expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greyhound racing industry, including the excellent Teesside park track in my constituency, stands to be ruined by the regulations. The afternoon opening of betting shops in 1961 caused a 15 per cent. drop in greyhound racing attendances in 1962 and 1963. That wiped out half the greyhound racing tracks. A similar drop in evening attendances is expected as a result of opening betting shops in the evening. The big three bookmakers own a handful of tracks. They will monopolise the sport by televising races from their own tracks. Greyhound racing authorities will not be able to control the number of races that are shown. The anticipated job losses will more than compensate for any supposed gains in betting shop employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big three bookmakers state that they cannot predict future pay scales or employment levies until they observe the progress of the new scheme of works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greyhound racing industry should be compensated so that it is treated at least in the same way as the horse racing industry. The greyhound industry has collected petitions as made its views known, to no avail. Its chairman, Lord Newall, did not even receive a copy of the press release that announced the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office laid an order before the House on 19 January. Howls of protest emanated from all parts of the racing and betting industry. The Opposition laid a prayer against the order and daily accuse the Government of corruption. That charge was repeated today. My hon. Friend the Minister should provide a full, adequate explanation and guaranteed protection for those who are affected, or rescind the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject of our debate raises strong feelings. Consequently, many silly things have been said. I hope that members of the Committee will make sensible comments during the remainder of our deliberations, because the subject that we discuss is important and will affect three complex industries: horse racing, greyhound racing and bookmaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North obviously keeps closely in touch with dog racing, horse racing and betting. He said that the issue first came to his attention when employees of betting shops asked for his advice about what to do when presented by their employers with a new contract that they did not wish to sign. The hon. Gentleman did not tell the Committee what advice he gave. I hope that it was good advice. However, I suspect that if it was good advice, he would probably have repeated it to the Committee. He should have told the employees that contracts may be changed only by negotiation. If employees do not wish to change their contracts, but the employer behaves as if they have been changed, they could sue the employer for breach of contract. That would be difficult for an individual, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
not for the many employees who apparently do not wish their contracts to be changed, and have the Opposition's advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I wish to progress further. I hope that the hon. Gentleman gave the advice that I suggested. Even if employees did not sue for breach of contract, but employment law was applicable to them, they could claim unfair dismissal at a tribunal. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North nods his head. Perhaps he acknowledges that his knowledge was insufficient to reply to the people who asked his advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned insufficient knowledge. The knowledge of a Minister who assumes that individual working people, many of whom have no trade union support, should risk their livelihoods by taking any of the big three bookies to court is less sufficient than ours. The Minister does not live in the real world. It is in the Minister's power not to press the regulations. The contracts are a matter for him. He appears to have no remedy for the countless cases other than to say that, like the Prime Minister and the 
	<i>New Statesman,</i> individuals should have recourse to law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reflects, and as the 
	<i>Hansard</i> record will show, I specifically excluded individuals. I realise that it is very difficult for individuals to take an employer to court in that way. My point was that, if the opposition were as great as the hon. Gentleman claimed, the trade union support, the number of test cases and the help of the hon. Gentleman's advice would make it perfectly straightforward to take the matter to court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to give way on that point. It was put by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, and I have answered. The hon. Gentleman also asked about de-licensing. Betting shops' licenses are renewed annually, and new circumstances are taken into account then. It is possible that, if a betting shop opened after 6.30 pm, the licensing authority could consider that the terms on which the license was issued were being breached and that the matter should be reviewed. The licensing authorities have a real role. They can certainly review licenses when they come up for renewal, and probably also when a shop decides to stay open later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman. Many hon. Members wish to intervene, but I wish to press on. I will give hon. Members a chance to speak when I have finished my remarks, and will answer points at the end of our proceedings. However, in due course I shall give way to the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale), as I know that his interest and knowledge of the subject are considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by dispelling the impression conveyed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South and Opposition Members that the Government's decision was sprung on an unsuspecting industry—apart from three firms—and public. That is nonsense. The idea has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
around for a long time. The Home Affairs Select Committee—of which the hon. Member for Mansfield was a member—twice recommended in 1991, in successive reports on the horse race betting levy and on fund raising for greyhound racing, that evening opening should be allowed. In fact, I recall that the Select Committee criticised me for not getting on with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate degenerated when it was suggested that there was a secret agenda and that shady deals were done. My right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary and I had several meetings on the matter at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. No decision was taken until shortly before the announcement. Given that the industry knew that there was a review and that the Select Committee had recommended evening opening, it is of course possible that the larger companies might have considered that evening opening could come about and that therefore they should prepare for the eventuality by reorganising their contracts ahead of the beginning of the season in April. If it did not come about, they would have lost nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not resent the suggestion that somehow there was collusion and a pay-off. It just makes me rather tired to think that hon. Members consider their arguments to be so thin that they have to descend to that level. A perfect example of the thinness of argument was given by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). He was so inefficient in grabbing the first slur that he could get hold of that he did not even know which Walker was the Walker of Brent Walker Group plc. That is a pretty good example of the type of research that goes into such allegations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It never occurred to me or to my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary when we made the decision to consider whether any of the big three companies were contributors to the Conservative party. Since I first heard those slurs, I have made what inquiries I could. I believe that no such payment has been made for which this measure is the pay-off. However, I discovered that the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, West is a director of one of those companies. I am certain that he would check the interests of his company and would not be interested in any deal with the Government, although he would recognise that this Government's policies are about deregulating when it is sensible to do so and extending choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister seriously expect us to believe that he met the Home Secretary around the turn of the year to decide to introduce the measures, only for it to happen as if by magic as January progressed that hundreds of people were threatened with the sack unless they signed new contracts? I take the Minister at his word. I am sure that neither he nor the Home Secretary picked up the phone and called the big three bookies. But will he explain, in the Committee's spirit of friendship, why on earth those bookies started issuing contracts in January? They had not done so in the months before. If they were not sure that the new regime would begin in April, why did they start the process at all? Did they not find out by one means or another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should extend his research. I should be interested in the results. The questions that he is raising did not exercise me, although I was aware well before the decision was made that plans were in hand for the changes. I knew that because it has been reported to me—possibly in November, certainly in December—that letters had been sent to my Department to that effect. Commercial foresight is an easier explanation of the coincidence than plotting. If the bookies calculated that there would be a change, what did they lose by making the alterations? Large companies need to lay their plans well ahead, and the hon. Gentleman should direct his questions to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I met many people about this matter last autumn, and some more in January. Most of them were critics of evening opening. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South mentioned Lord Newall, whom I saw three times last year. We discussed the subject on each occasion. No discourtesy to him was intended over the press release. I had ensured that he would be told that an announcement was imminent and I believe that the usual press releases and information were sent to his organisation, if not to him personally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the Home Affairs Select Committee issued two reports in which it recommended evening opening and that I was criticised for not getting on with it. However, the Home Office view was that evening opening fitted into the Government's policy of removing unjustifiable regulations and enabling providers and goods and services to meet the needs of customers more fully and flexibly, thus encouraging competition and choice. That is anathema to Labour Members. It shows how far the Labour party must go before it achieves its leaders' goal of becoming user-friendly and Clintonised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were determined to consult all interested parties before making a final decision. I give way to the hon. Member for Mansfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, albeit so late in our proceedings.

The Minister implied that staff could collectively take their cases to court. He obviously does not realise that the big three bookmakers refuse to recognise trade unions. They will not negotiate with trade unions. Many employees have been told to leave the union or leave the business. It is therefore not possible for the staff to do as the Minister suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not claim that employees were not worried. However, it is possible for staff to take action collectively. It is not lawful for a firm to threaten to dismiss staff for belonging to a union. Recognition is another matter. It is possible to belong to a union and use its advice and support, even when it is not recognised.

I appreciate that time is running on, but I have been asked to justify the Government's decision and I am determined to do that. The consultation document was issued in 1991. We wanted comments from all interested parties. We carefully examined all the comments that we received. Representative bodies of all sections of the horse racing industry supported the decision, because an increasing number of horse racing meetings are held in the evening. Last year, about 25 per cent. of all meetings were held in the evenings. The trend continues. It is no longer sensible for betting shops to close at 6.30 pm when meetings on which people wish to bet are held later. That point is crucial and weighed heavily with the Government. Betting shops were legalised to provide an honest, well-regulated, lawful opportunity for people to bet. That principle has formed common ground between political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If many attractive betting occasions take place in the evening, it makes no sense to deny the punters and public the opportunity of placing off-course bets in the evening, unless overwhelming reasons exist for not allowing that. One such reason might have been police anxiety about law and order. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers made it clear that it had no objection. We received a letter from the association. It is well balanced, as one would expect from a responsible public body. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The general principle of evening opening is acceptable to the Association of Chief Police Officers and there is no reason to suppose that the level of policing commitment to licensed betting offices would increase significantly as a result, although extended hours could increase the risk of robberies and thefts but to what level is a matter for conjecture."</p></blockquote>
Of course, if betting shops are open longer, there will be more opportunities for theft, which may increase to the same level faced by other organisations that open in the evening, especially in the summer when the evenings are light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The muggers charter argument holds no water at all. The weightiest argument against evening opening from
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South and the hon. Member for Nottingham, North is that the three large bookmaking organisations are in favour—those companies put themselves beyond the pale because they dominate the off-course bookmaking scene. They see a demand for evening betting that they want unashamedly to satisfy. That is why they are in business. The Gallup survey confirms that there is a demand. There is no reason to believe that a survey conducted by a reputable research body such as Gallup is incorrect, but all surveys have a margin of error. However, its results were so clear-cut that it seems to be a useful guide. It found that only 21 per cent. of betting shop users were against evening opening, 54 per cent. were in favour, and an overwhelming 72 per cent. said that the shops should be left to decide, which is the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, South rightly said that out of the 845 bookmakers who replied to the consultation document, 796—or 94 per cent.—were against evening opening because they felt that evening overheads would be greater than evening profitability, because they doubled up as on-course bookies in the evening and did not want to have to decide whether to stay in the shop or go on course, or because they preferred not to work in the evening. But that 796 represents only about 14 per cent. of the non-big-three bookmakers. The vast majority did not reply. It would be natural for those against to take the trouble to say no, and for the rest who do not mind or who are marginally in favour not to bother and to say nothing. We carefully considered the reasons that were given, but no honest appraisal of those responses would conclude that the majority opinion was against: most did not say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have met small bookmakers who believe that evening opening will not only bring extra business but increase their ability to compete with the big three. They explained to me, "Our shops are in the suburbs, so we don't have inner-city, high street locations. We don't get so many people placing bets during daytime working hours, but we expect to get a larger share of bets placed by people nearer their homes." That is a good and positive argument. It is not true to say that all small bookmakers are against this extension of hours. They look forward to the additional opportunity and advantage that evening opening will bring them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is a real worry. Of the 4,427 betting shop employees who replied to the consultation exercise or to the A. R. Dennis survey, the overwhelming majority were against. However, they represent only 8.5 per cent. of all betting shop employees. Again, one would expect those against to write in—4,700 is enough to fill all our postbags. Those who are not worried will not do so. I do not believe that the consultation shows, as my hon. Friend suggests, that the overwhelming majority of employees are against. I would expect them to be interested and concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0698">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
everyone will be concerned to know how an extension of hours will affect them. Some people will think that there will be increased opportunities for extra earnings, for promotion and the chance to negotiate flexible working hours, which they do not have at the moment. Others fear that it will not suit them at all. Such worry and opportunity must have been among the calculations of any shop that decides to open in the evening, and plenty have decided to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, good managements consult to find arrangements that achieve their business objective by providing the service that their customers want, with minimum inconvenience to their staff. That is not always possible; some employers try harder than others and some do not try hard enough. I applaud those who do; I criticise those who do not. It is not an argument for changing hours and allowing extra choice for customers and consumers when the other arguments are also valid. It is a matter between employers and employees; many will find that the new arrangements suit them well, but some, alas, will not. But, I do not believe that that is a decisive argument to sway us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the important objection from the greyhound racing industry: unlike the horse racing industry, which is overwhelmingly in favour of evening opening, nearly all the greyhound interests that responded were against it. Their argument to me was, "There are many people who come to greyhound racing, not because they want to watch it, but because they want to bet. If you opened betting shops in the evening, they would go there instead, because it is easier. Keep the shops shut and make them continue to come to us."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are really saying that there is a pent-up demand for evening opening of betting shops and that a visit to the greyhouind track is too unattractive for them to compete effectively. I do not think that it would have been right and proper for a Government committed to widening consumer choice to have accepted that argument as a reason for saying no to evening opening. However, their argument helped to tip the balance against year-round evening opening—although the chief reason is that evening horse racing meetings are confined largely to the summer months. Therefore, evening opening will be from April to the end of August. I do not know—no one can know—what impact, if any, evening opening will have on dog racing attendance. I believe that the industry underestimated its attractions: many dog tracks offer excellent facilities for an enjoyable evening out for dog racing enthusiasts and those interested in the food and the atmosphere at the races.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry should not lose out if it promotes itself effectively. For most people—except, perhaps, for the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, who waxed eloquent about warm betting shops—an evening at the race track is infinitely more fun than one in a betting shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the industry succeeds: a real sign that it can came immediately after the announcement. When the Home Secretary's announcement was made and the cry of desolation went up from the industry's leaders, many people were reminded that dog tracks existed and attendance immediately increased. It is the industry's job to keep those extra spectators and to attract more. I congratulate the industry because it has approached the Home Office with several positive proposals for further
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
deregulation, which it believes will help the dog industry to compete. I have had discussions with the industry and I look forward to talking with it about other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the Government's job unreasonably to restrict competition among betting shops and to frustrate punters visiting the track by default. I shall end my remarks now and hope to answer points from hon. Members in the time remaining. I take it from what the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said that any future Labour Government would reverse the regulations. Such a Government, by closing the betting shops in the evening, would cause the people who work there to lose their jobs and the horse racing industry to lose the proceeds that flow from late opening. Even if the dog racing industry prospers from evening opening, the choices to the punter would be reduced if a Labour Government got back into power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A future Labour Government would support the greyhound industry and the independent bookmakers. This Government have failed abjectly to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no, and with that I conclude my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the time and the number of hon. Members who wish to speak, I shall be very brief. The Minister closed his remarks by speculating on the effect on the greyhound industry and suggesting that pent-up demand would cause people to go to betting shops instead. The greyhound industry is the second largest spectator sport in the country, attracting enormous numbers of people. Many of those people do not go to meetings simply to bet. The audience is different from the clientele of a betting shop. People go to meetings because they can take their families and have a meal on a Saturday night. However, a smaller but significant number of people go to the track to bet. The state of the leisure industry in general is such that a small change in turnover and crowd sizes will have a significant effect on the survival of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stockton, South quoted the figures: a 15 per cent. drop in turnover would cause serious trouble for 50 per cent. of the tracks. It is not a question of an alternative audience; that small change could make a crucial difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the Home Affairs Select Committee recommended evening opening to 9 o'clock. This proposal is for betting shops to stay open until 10 o'clock. But the Home Affairs Committee made other recommendations for producing a level playing field and concerning relaxations in track-to-track tote betting, off-course pool betting or stakes in Satellite Information Services. None of those recommendations has been acted on. If the Minister is serious about consultation with the greyhound industry I hope that he will take some of those recommendations on board. Such changes will be essential if evening opening is to go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall turn to the people who work in betting shops. It is wrong to say that the several thousand people who replied to consultation formed only a small proportion of the total number of people involved. How
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
many people can be expected to respond? The number represented a very significant proportion of the people who work in betting shops. Compared with most consultation exercises, the number of letters received is significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the Gallup poll. It covered 35 sites and an average of 30 people at each site meant that a total of 1,442 people were interviewed. However, those interviews were carried out between 1.30 and 2.30 pm, 2.30 and 4.30 pm and after 4 pm. That means that the pollsters have stood outside a betting shop and interviewed 10 people in each session. That does not mean that everyone is in favour of betting late in the evening. It is ridiculous to make that claim based on such a small sample.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. The extended hours will be voluntary and bookmakers will be able to decide whether to stay open. I am sure that if large bookmakers are open, the small shops will be forced to stay open to compete. That will have an enormous effect on the small businesses that employ two or three people. It will not be voluntary, because the people who decide not to open will go under because they will not be able to compete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of people living above and near betting shops, the Minister said that the licensing authority would consider the matter every year and might be able to deal with problems. I am sceptical because my experience of other licensing regulations and planning permission is that once licences have been granted they are extremely difficult to lose. There would have to be a serious disturbance over a period of time before someone was in danger of losing his licence. It will be impossible to deal with problems caused to people living near betting shops by late night opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I should like to say more, I shall stop now because I know that other members of the Committee wish to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.51 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Fergus Montgomery 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Altrincham and Sale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest as a parliamentary adviser to the National Association of Bookmakers. Even if I did not hold that position, I would still be opposed to this extension of hours. I have great regard for my hon. Friend the Minister, but I was not impressed with his defence of the regulations. Ignoring the majority view put foward in the consultation period makes no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the small bookmaker does not have to open in the evenings if he does not want to, but if he closes his customers will go to the big three to put their bets on in the evening, and the chances are that they will continue to do so, so that more and more smaller bookmakers in the independent sector will go under. The big three would become bigger and stronger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand why greyhound racing has been treated in this way. Since the advent of betting shops, the number of people attending greyhound racing has dropped dramatically. If there is evening opening and people are able to watch greyhound racing on television, many people, despite what my hon. Friend says, will sit in the betting shop and place their bets rather than go to
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
the course. If we want to attract new audiences to evening racing, providing competition by allowing betting shops to open in the evenings is nto the right way to go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I like to have a flutter on the horses: I am known as the bookies' friend because I place silly bets, such as yankees and heinz, which involve four or five horses. My father said that it is difficult enough to pick one winner, never mind four or five, so I was a mug. But I have always had a dream that one day the same thing would happen to me as happened to someone in a betting shop years ago. It was Royal Ascot week and he placed a half crown yankee and won £1,600. They held thebetting slip up and said, "How's this for luck?" I have always had a dream that one day it would be my betting slip, but it has not happened yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who bet usually get our winnings the next day. One of the arguments of my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary was that shops would stay open until 10 pm so that people could collect their winnings on the later races. The Home Affairs Select Committee recommended 9 pm. Why do we need an extra hour? Most people do what I do. It does not happen to me often, but if I win I go the next day to collect my winnings. Anyone betting on a late race could easily collect his winnings the next day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious reservations about this measure. Opposition Members have made valid points. People who live near betting shops were happy for them to close at 6.30 pm, but they are worried about them remaining open until 10 pm. Betting office staff are also worried about remaining until 10 pm in an office where a great deal of money is kept. That presents security problems. I am disappointed in my hon. Friend the Minister's response. I agree with him on many subjects, but I disagree with him about the evening opening of betting shops.
Perhaps he can assure the Committee that the scheme will be monitored and that if the objections that have been raised prove to be justified, the Government will rectify the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister has spoken from ignorance, not malfeasance. A betting shop does not need to be open for someone to bet on an evening race.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will open a can of worms if they aim for deregulation. The big three bookmakers rig the market. They own the majority of betting shops, and SIS which broadcasts the races to the shops. Ladbrokes is the biggest single player in the on-course betting ring. The odds are fixed. The customer in the betting shop does not see all the shows that are available on the course. The market is manipulated. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry that the Minister is not listening—perhaps he is not interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next step is for Ladbrokes, Hill and Coral to own the jockeys, horses and stables. That is the logical conclusion to draw from what the Minister said. It is not a monopoly, because three companies dominate—it is a triopoly. Three companies rig the market, screw the customer, fix the odds and maximise the profits. The companies are no longer betting shop organisations. They own holiday camps, hotels and overseas businesses. Their money is generated by screwing the poor, ordinary punter, who risks his half crown like the hon. Member for

Altrincham and Sale (Sir F. Montgomery). To assume that everyone who does not respond to proposals supports them is an interesting definition of consultation. I am sure that the Government will use that model in drafting future legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give two of the many examples of the predicament of betting shop staff. One person worked for William Hill for 23 years. She was given 14 days to sign a contract which stated that she would be required to work up to 62 hours a week without overtime payment, a day off or a lunch break. She was given 14 days to sign or be dismissed. The Minister claims that she could take that giant organisation to an industrial tribunal at some time in future. It takes up to two years for such cases to be heard because so many people are suing employers for wrongful dismissal. What happens if the tribunal orders reinstatement? Is she to return to the firm, only to be sacked again? What compensation is that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another lady has worked for the firm for only four years. For the past seven weeks she has been trusted to manage shops on behalf of William Hill in Bradford and Leeds. She is such a valued and trusted employee that she is allowed to manage shops. But she is threatened with dismissal next Friday unless she signs the contract. The way in which Hill and Ladbrokes have treated their employees borders on vicious. Ladbrokes has shown
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
some finesse in its dealings. Coral is not as guilty as the other two firms. But the regulations constitute a cop-out to accommodate three bookmakers to the detriment of the racing industry and the punters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
