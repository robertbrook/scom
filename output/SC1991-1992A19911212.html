	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) have a point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the point of order, of which I gave you notice, Mr. Lamond. During our proceedings on Tuesday morning, I spoke about policing and the laws and byelaws under amendment No. 44, which dealt with the title, and thus the scope and content of schedule 1. The Chairman on Tuesday, Mr. Latham, asked me to revert to amendment No. 39. I assume that he feared that I was straying from the collective scope of the selected amendments. I thus moved on to the topic of noise—perhaps too hastily—and related that to schedule 1. However, amendment No. 39 dealt with the length and value of works that could be specified in any order under clause 1. Amendment No. 44 dealt with the title and function of schedule 1, which is entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Matters within Sections 1 and 3".</p></blockquote>
It is unclear whether those matters are mandatory, permissive, or illustrative. The Minister believed that they were only illustrative. However, methods of policing and byelaws are important features of many transport systems. There is, therefore, a good case for listing such arrangements in schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you confirm, Mr. Lamond, that references to schedule 1 are subjects that could be included in it, such as policing, are in order during debates on powers in the Bill to make orders to permit works? Will you also confirm, Mr. Lamond, that such references are primarily relevant to the content of an application for an order, and the associated documents, and cannot apply to Bills, as the Minister claimed on Tuesday?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to prolong the proceedings. As an earnest of that, Mr. Lamond, I have given you notice of the points with as much brevity as precision required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the hon. Member for Newham, South for his courtesy in giving me notice of the point of order that he intended to make. It would have been difficult to deal with it otherwise, because I was not in the Chair for the first sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Mr. Latham ruled from the Chair that to raise policing matters on the first group of amendments grouped with amendment 39 was going rather wide, he was not aware that, later in the debate, the Minister would tell the Committee that the matters listed in schedule 1 were illustrative rather than exhaustive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
I cannot, of course, rule on hypothetical questions about the scope of debate on amendments that we have not yet reached. The Chair must always make a judgment as the debate unfolds. In the circumstances, I incline to the view that references to the content of schedule 1 might reasonably go wider than would normally be expected from the content of the schedule as it stands. I remind the Committee that it is possible to debate the Question, "That the schedule be the first schedule to the Bill". A general debate about its content would come most appropriately at that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Lamond. I thank you for that ruling. I hope that when we reach that point in the Bill, I can pursue the matter further. We could then discuss whether any part of a Bill or an Act can be illustrative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot bind my fellow Chairman to anything at the moment. It would be for him to decide at the time. My answer to the hon. Gentleman's point of order gives him a generous hint. I now call the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) who is, not unexpectedly, anxious to speak. It would save the Committee's time if the hon. Gentleman would refrain from giving me a prolonged welcome to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment proposed [10 December],</i> No. 32, in page 1, line 17, at the end to insert the words

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are considering the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly not give you a prolonged welcome to the Chair, Mr. Lamond, especially in view of that somewhat icy remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When our previous sitting was adjourned, I was about to say that the Minister had said that I need not worry about Ministers having the power to make statutory instruments without further parliamentary procedure. I had referred to safety, and the Minister replied that clauses 42, 43 and 44 were subject to the negative procedure, and that all was well. However, safety is covered in other clauses that link with clause 1. Although clause 6 provides that the Secretary of State can make yet further rules under yet further
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
orders not subject to parliamentary procedure, they can be dispensed with under clause 7 on matters relating to
	<br><blockquote><p>"naval, military, air force or other defence purposes of a railway, tramway or other system."</p></blockquote>
Clause 7(1)(b) gives the Secretary of State the power to introduce an order without having to follow the rules that he is required to produce under clause 6 when he determines that it is expedient, in the interests of safety
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<ol>

	<li>"(i) for the purpose of suspending or discontinuing any operations or</li>

	<li>(ii) in consequence of the abandonment or neglect of any works."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
He can also make an order for costs. Clause 7(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An order made by virtue of subsection (1)(b) above may include provision for the recovery by the Secretary of State of the costs of making the order and of carrying its provisions into effect."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that I was not concerned about costs, which is not true. The Secretary of State will have an order-making power under clause I for the recovery of costs, yet the Minister has not explained to the Committee how those costs will be calculated. It all comes back to clause 1 or clause 3, which we shall discuss later and in which the order-making powers are extensive. They permit the Secretary of State to raise some revenue to cover costs without further parliamentary procedure. That is unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 8, the Secretary of State may "prescribe model provisions" for incorporation in draft orders. Once again, that gives him more powers to make orders without any parliamentary procedure. The draftsmen have had a field day in the Bill. They could have said simply on the first page, "Hand over all parliamentary powers to the Secretary of State and forget about it" because that is virtually what the Bill does. All the provisions that the Secretary of State may make under clause 8 can be dispensed with when making orders under clauses 1 or 3. Again, that is an extensive procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that those powers were relatively modest and routine, but clause 12(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An order under section 1 or 3 above authorising a compulsory purchase shall be subject to special parliamentary procedure to the same extent as it would be, by virtue of section 18 or 19 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981."</p></blockquote>
That Act provides for the compulsory purchase of National Trust land, but the National Trust can object. It provides also for the compulsory purchase
	<br><blockquote><p>"of any land forming part of a common, open space or fuel or field garden allotment."</p></blockquote>
The order
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be subject to special parliamentary procedure unless the Secretary of State"—</p></blockquote>
who has also the power to issue an order not subject to parliamentary procedure—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is satisfied—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) that there has been or will be given in exchange for such land, other land, not being less in area and being equally advantageous to the persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights,"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Such an argument can rage locally over whether an equivalent area of land is equally advantageous to that which will be compulsorily purchased. For instance, does it catch the sun? Is it shielded from traffic? Ministers in Whitehall may decide that it is equally advantageous, but local people may disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special parliamentary procedure involves a local inquiry. Nobody is grumbling about that, but the Secretary of State may dispense with the inquiry and issue a certificate to assert that he has taken into account the representations of all objectors. That means that the Secretary of State has much power. The reference to the 1981 Act shields the fact that he has the power compulsorily to purchase land—whether it be an allotment, a field garden, an open space, a common or other facility for local people—and decide on the equivalent land. He may say simply, "I have taken into account the objections, dispensed with a local inquiry and issued a certificate and have now made the order." No further parliamentary procedure would be required. Therefore, this small clause at the beginning of the Bill is handing over an important power to the Secretary of State. The amendment would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to dispute the hon. Gentleman's masterly analysis, which I am sure is comprehensive and probably correct. Although we are proposing a major transfer of parliamentary power to the Secretary of State, the powers and rules involved are the same as those that apply to thousands of other planning matters, such as road development. We are suggesting that the same rules for land compensation will apply to railway developments as apply to road developments. Is that an unreasonable proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) for raising that interesting issue. I do not think that a negative procedure instrument is a great parliamentary safeguard, but it might be useful to enable an hon. Member to table a prayer against an order that deals with an allocation of land in exchange for a compulsorily purchase area and about which a dispute is raging in his or her constituency. That is not much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were no objections to the compulsorily purchase orders for the construction of the M1. However, times had changed by the time of the proposals for the Aire valley trunk road. I was the Member for Parliament for Keighley then and remember well what happened. People questioned the need for a motorway of that scale. Over six to 12 months, the inquiry was subject to sustained disruption. Eventually local people ground it to a halt. The Minister involved introduced new rules and inspectors were not paid for by the Department of Transport. That shows the change in public attitude to such proposals. People would prefer a minor safeguard to be provided than to allow the Minister to have carte blanche.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned roads. People demanded and determined that streamlined planning
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
procedures, which prevailed in the 1970s, be changed. They did so by disrupting the inquiry that was held in Shipley town hall. People were shut out, so they smashed down the door and stopped the inquiry. That is how strongly people felt about the proposals. The motorway proposal was scaled down to a trunk road and the 120 houses that were going to be demolished were preserved. The area has been upgraded and is now attractive and pleasant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be careful about planning procedures. People's attitude to the environment has improved; they have rightly become much more demanding. I ask not for a great public inquiry but, simply that when a Minister makes an order he should lay it before Parliament. Hon. Members asked during the previous debate whether there should be a 10-page limit on a statutory instrument. I have a copy of the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1991, which runs to 140 pages including the explanatory note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes (Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) asks me to read it. It would make an entertaining hour and a half. This is the same category of order. It is not subject to further parliamentary control. People say that it is routine, and question whether parliamentary control is important, but a previous example of such an order failed to register guns for Iraq. Such orders can have important consequences, because they list all the things that it would be naughty and wrong to export to countries that we consider cannot handle such goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One order failed to register high-quality fabricated stainless steel barrels with firing facilities. The Minister failed to carry out his duty and incorporate them in the order. Had the order been laid before Parliament, it is unlikely than an hon. Member would have tabled a prayer to say that a supergun was being manufactured in the Midlands and Sheffield and should be included in the order. But one of the pleasures of Parliament is that when something obscure arises in the House, there is always one Member of Parliament who is willing to give some information or to raise issues about it. Hon. Members have a wealth of knowledge and esoteric expertise that can be brought to bear at such times. It is useful for Parliament to act as a scrutiny body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I revert to the order that my hon. Friend mentioned? Is he saying that the order is not subject to any prayer, and that if a railway which was not a matter of national significance, were at issue, under the Bill, the Secretary of State could vary the order in any particular way relating to an area of, say, Faversham, Dartford or Buxton and that no Member of Parliament could do anything about it other than go to the Secretary of State and privately ask him to change it? Is the Minister really saying that the purport of the clause is to empower the Secretary of State to amend anything he wishes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is, essentially, the position. Often civil servants produce orders without knowing what
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
they mean. The Bill gives the Secretary of State powers that are not subject to any parliamentary procedure, but even when orders are subject to parliamentary procedure, civil servants sometimes do not know what they mean. The Minister signed the Harbours, Docks, Piers and Ferries The Ports Act 1991 (Levy on Disposals of Land, etc.) Order 1991. That falls within his area of responsibility. As that order is an affirmative order it is subject to examination by the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments and will later be subject to the affirmative procedure in the House. We asked the civil servants who appeared before the Committee on Tuesday what a "tested telex" was. The Minister may know, but the civil servants told us that they had copied it from another document and did not know what it meant. There were other things that they could not explain, but I shall report that to the House in due course. Those are the dangers that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That order will be subject to report and will be considered in a debate. No doubt the Minister will say that an amending order will be issued in due course to make everything clear. But the Bill empowers the Secretary of State to make orders that are not subject to parliamentary procedure, so what dangers lurk in the corners behind the closed doors of Whitehall?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that there is worse to come. Under the order-making powers in clause 16, the Minister may direct that planning permission for a development
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be deemed to be granted, subject to such conditions (if any) as may be specified in the direction."</p></blockquote>
The little order-making power so innocently proposed at the beginning of the Bill is suddenly developing apace. Not only can the Minister make an order that is not subject to parliamentary procedure but he can now deem that planning consent will be given. He can take the decision away from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be good reason for that, such as to develop a railway system. I am in favour of developing railway systems. I regret the dereliction and decline of railways in the past 10 or 12 years because of Government policy. However, surely we should have the right to exercise scrutiny if that planning permission is deemed to be given. There should be some last resort of parliamentary examination rather than handing over virtually untrammelled powers to the Secretary of State under this seemingly innocent clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly at this point as it might be helpful. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State can vary, change or repeal any Act of parliament that is relevant to the new powers in the order. Is that power confined to a few tidying-up clauses, or could it be used to repeal a complete Act or important sections of an Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into that now, as I have tabled an amendment on the subject. We are talking about Henry VIII clauses that are even more outrageous than this one. I shall dwell on those clauses later, because it will be necessary to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say, rightly, "We have been doing this for a long time", but we should not endorse
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
a new proposal just because it has been done in the past. Although it may be reluctant to do so, at some stage Parliament must tackle subordinate legislation. Handing measures to a Minister and his civil servants is so much more convenient. It brushes things out of the way until constituents ask their Member of Parliament, "What are you going to do about it? Are you going to raise it in Parliament?" The hon. Member has to reply, "The Minister has the power to do it. I can raise the issue in an Adjournment debate but I cannot stop the Minister by tabling a prayer, for example, and getting the sympathy of Labour Front Bench spokesmen in allocating time for it, because it is not subject to such parliamentary procedure."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This seemingly innocent little clause is giving more powers to the Minister. In clause 23(3), subject to a couple of conditions in subsections (2)(a) and (b), appear the remarkable words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsections (1) and (2) above, an order under section 1 or 3 above shall not, either before"—</p></blockquote>
that is extraordinary—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or after it has been made, be questioned in any legal proceedings whatever."</p></blockquote>
That is a bold and extensive power. Within 42 days, an application can be made to a High Court but after that, and outside the conditions laid down in clause 23, the orders that are not subject to any further parliamentary proceedings cannot be questioned by any legal proceedings. That is wrong. Once the order has been made and the time set out in clause 23 has elapsed, people cannot go to court and ask for an order of mandamus to require a Minister to act, for judicial review or for anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A function of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments is to examine orders that attempt to put the Minister outside the jurisdiction of the courts. We do not like to resort to the courts because in a sense that means that legislation has failed. I regard the high court of Parliament, with Members of Parliament acting on behalf of their constituents, as a repository of people's rights. But the courts, too, are a repository of the rights of individuals and should be open to them. The limit that is imposed sounds a cautionary note about handing clause 1 to the Minister in such a broad way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing giving powers to a Minister to produce orders without further parliamentary procedure. However, clause 24 allows the Minister to hand those powers to someone who is not a Minister—in fact, to anyone. It would be interesting to know to whom he intends to hand them. Clause 24(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by regulations prescribe classes of application which are to be dealt with by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose instead of by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Clause 24(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an application has been dealt with by a person appointed under this section, any order made by him under section 1 or 3 shall be treated as made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
Does the Committee want to hand the power to make law to anyone nominated by the Secretary of State? We are discussing law, not little notes and directions,
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
persuasions and codes of practice. That law will have the same power as a Bill that has gone through all its stages. People bring messages from the House of Lords saying that the Queen has approved a Bill. This Bill gives the Secretary of State power to make law without any further parliamentary procedure and lets him give that power to anyone appointed by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am

It is possible that the Secretary of State has in mind a category of persons, elected or unelected. I have tabled an amendment that proposes that a junior Minister should be nominated. The Secretary of State carries the legal responsibilities. He is the person to whom civil servants say, "You've got to do this, Minister. Sign this statutory instrument, Minister, we have checked it out and it will be all right. Don't bother with the details, we will put it before Parliament to be laid down within 40 days." In this case, however, we do not know who will be appointed. That is sub-delegation. It hands over powers from Parliament and we should be jealous of those powers. We are often accused of being careless with them, or of not invoking them rapidly enough. People say, "It is about time that a law was made." We should be cautious before we sub-delegate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments considers whether Ministers are shuffling off their responsibilities. The Secretary of State can withdraw powers, but how can people be made accountable if he hands powers to someone who is not a Minister and if there is no qualification that the person appointed should be so? There is no further parliamentary procedure for an order made by someone who is not a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People may say, "You are making this point because we have a Conservative Government and you are a Labour Member of Parliament." I would make the same point if there were a Labour Government because there must be accountability. My record under the previous Labour Government was not one of meek subservience. I recall my Chief Whip saying to me in the Lobby, "Are you voting Labour again tonight, Bob?" My vote was not always absolutely reliable. I argued that I voted for Labour party policy, because sometimes there were variations of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Handing power from Parliament is a serious matter and it should not be done lightly. The Minister may have a quicksilver explanation and a guarantee that can be put on the record to show that it is all as safe as houses, but I will take a lot of convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a powerful case against double delegation from this House. It is difficult enough when it involves only the Secretary of State, but my hon. Friend points out the dangers of the power going elsewhere. Under Standing Orders, can the order to which he refers be examined by the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments under the heading, "Unexpected use of Powers"? If so, can it be drawn to the attention of the House? Or is it an unexpected statutory instrument, even to hon. Members, that is beyond the reach of that important Select Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any unexpected use of powers would not be reportable if the Bill provided for something to be done about it. It is unexpected when the Minister interprets his powers in a way that was not foreseen when the Bill was drafted. If an Act provided for the Secretary of State to appoint someone, and he then made an order that was not subject to further parliamentary proceedings, the order would simply disappear. The Joint Select Committee on Statuory Instruments sometimes examines Bills that are not subject to parliamentary proceedings. We can report them, but the report is buried, because we have no means of placing it on the Order Paper. Where the Committee makes a report and a prayer has been tabled, it is starred on the Order Paper, and it states: "The Joint Committee has reported this to the House". Hon. Members can then obtain a report from the Vote Office. However, if we include a comment on an order that is not subject to parliamentary proceedings we cannot bring it to hon. Members' attention in the normal way. That is very unsatisfactory. I can draw attention to it only by raising points of order, which sometimes is difficult. If Mr. Speaker believes them to be spurious points of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. However, I have to overcome Mr. Speaker's initial resistance. When he realises that the point or order deals with statutory instruments, he readily gives me the opportunity to speak. But I am beset by difficulties! However, all those difficulties pale into insignificance when compared with the power that the Government propose to hand over. I hope that the Minister will re-examine the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained how clause 1 would spread through clause after clause, line a canker. Yet all I ask is that the instruments should be subject to annulment. Only between 2 per cent and 5 per cent or instruments are prayed against. I shall provide detailed figures if the Committee wishes. Only a fraction of that small percentage is given time on the Floor of the House. There is no danger of requests for many hours to be spent discussing the orders. There should be a safety net, so that if hon. Members want to use Parliament—which is an important focus of attention—to preserve people's rights in a last resort, the opportunity for a prayer should be available. We wish to preserve democratic accountability, which will otherwise be discarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has heard a splendid exposition of the arguments in favour of parliamentary control over statutory instruments. The hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is logical, The Bill deals with the application of normal planning procedures to a limited number of public works. If the logic of the case of the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sense of pride of parentage as I sat on the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure, which made the proposal that the House has decided to translate into a Bill. The Committee made our intentions clear and the objectives are set out in clause 1, so the hon. Member for Bradford, South has not discovered a well-concealed plot. We made it clear that we wanted to transfer public works projects from parliamentary procedure to public planning procedure. It was agreed by the vast majority of interested parties outside that the parliamentary system to scrutinise railway works and other projects did not work well. When Parliament considers a railways Bill, it often spends many hours discussing some broad matter of principle or railway funding. The detail that is encompassed in an order is hardly scrutinised. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that it could be scrutinised if there were a safety valve. None the less, the better way to scrutinise such matters is by public inquiry where local interests have much more scope to make their representations. The Joint Committee decided that public works projects would be better examined under public planning procedures. It decided that that would also save a lot of parliamentary time. Public inquiries provide better scrutiny, are more efficient and save parliamentary time. The hon. Gentleman's logic is that we should bring it all back into Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or that it should be possible to bring it back into Parliament. The proposition is attractive. We must apply the logic of the hon. Gentleman's case, which he advanced strongly, to thousands of other statutory instruments that we have allowed to escape from our system. That is such a major proposition that we need a forum other than the Committee to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), for giving way, but, to use railway parlance, the driver has gone right past the station after someone has pulled the communication cord; there has been another train failure. He accused my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) of wanting to apply the procedure, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
he advocated, to thousands of relatively small instruments. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that for a railway proposal that is not deemed by the Secretary of State to be of national significance, 20 or 30 planning applications might be made—one for each station? There could be 30, 40, 50 or 200 farmers involved, 200 or 300 factories and 2,000 or 3,000 dwellings. It is not correct to compare them.

Did the Jont Committee receive any evidence in favour of the complete removal of the procedure from Parliament, without even an instrument subject to prayer, rather than the appropriate removal of the inquiry procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I resist the temptation to spend too much time re-examining the Committee's report. Its conclusions were reached at the end of its deliberations. I cannot put my hand on my heart and say that all the bodies that approached the Committee had in front of them the ultimate conclusions against which their representations could be tested. But the general proposition was that we should adopt planning procedures and general planning rules that apply to other projects all over Britain. In the amendments, we have got to the heart of the Bill. That is a perfectly sensible approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recall that the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments recommended that the procedure should be subject to orders?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I believe that the change applies only to matters that are deemed to be of national significance. I think that it would be more helpful to Parliament if the proposed change were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On matters of local significance, such as construction projects, the system is simple. The question is whether they should be subject to parliamentary procedure, such as a negative procedure. That is a proper proposition but the same considerations should apply to all other planning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely what is at issue is the principle that is being established. Is it logical to assume that all statutory instruments would be affected? If the principle extends wider, will it include private Bills? That would relieve the work of the House and channel it into more appropriate areas. Will the principle apply to any other measure that may be introduced that would take away private Bill provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. It is a matter of principle, but it must be done in that
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
fashion. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) is asking for much more than a modest little control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in our previous sitting, I am not opposed to orders that are not subject to any further parliamentary procedure being used for relatively trivial matters. To say that I asked every statutory instrument to be subject to the negative procedure is not accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but it will be difficult to define what is large and what is small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that Parliament has to tackle the question of scrutiny of subordinate legislation. He may be right, but that proposition would involve major scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, was a member of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments for many years when the late Sir Graham Page was chairman—a salutary experience. I suspect that I was put on that Committee because in my early years as a Member of Parliament I got the same message as the hon. Member for Bradford, South. Often people would say to me, "Voting Labour again, Roger?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respect the point that the hon. Member for Bradford, South made. I have no doubt that he would argue the same fundamental principle just as strongly under a Labour Government. The Joint Committee proposed that we remove these matters from Parliament and into the realm of planning for 101 reasons. The hon. Gentleman is saying that we are doing too much and that we should claw something back so that there is a parliamentary brake, if we wish to apply it. That is a perfectly proper proposition, but I would rather tackle it more broadly. In the meantime, we should make this system work, because there is a general feeling that it would work better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unreal to suggest that every time that we transfer an order-making power to the Secretary of State he will be able to exercise unfettered power and do virtually what he likes. It is not like that at all. The hon. Member for Bradford, South said that when he was a Minister he could exercise hardly any discretion or power because he was so fettered by other statutes. Powers relating to land compensation, noise, safety and so on are not unfettered, but are very restricted. Decisions can be challenged in the courts and are subject to the scope of other legislation. Before the hon. Member for Newham, South reacts to the suggestion that Parliament should yield these powers, I say that we should transfer this power from the unsatisfactory private Bill procedure to the planning laws.

If Opposition Members are dissatisfied with the planning laws and the procedures for their scrutiny, they should tackle them as a broad proposition not by disputing the Joint Committee's proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
the Committee, which sat for a long time and produced an extensive document. The broad proposition applies: if, under the present planning laws that apply to roads, highways and other constructions—works, ports and so on—there is a power to sub-delegate, that must be the proposition for railways. The hon. Gentleman may suggest that we should change it but the issue should be viewed as one of principle with respect to the planning laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I chaired a private Bill Committee—the Ginns and Gutteridge Crematorium Bill—which went on for months. The subject was whether planning permission should be given for a crematorium to be built in a city centre. Without any shadow of doubt, it was a planning matter. We sat for a record 26 sitting days simply because in 1906 Parliament decreed in minor legislation that crematoria should not be built within 50 yards of people's houses. It was an accident of history that that section existed. Parliament spent months with considerable protests from many hon. Members considering something that was categorically a planning matter. We recommended that the law should be changed and that such planning matters should be dealt with under a better procedure. That is what we have not as a general proposition. Railway matters are far better dealt with outside Parliament. We should be careful about reopening opportunities for Parliament to scrutinise such matters. The hon. Member for Bradford, South and other hon. Members are brilliant at exploiting such opportunities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are plenty who do and plenty who do not. The hon.

As a broad proposition it could be examined in other procedural committees, but I believe that the Bill is right as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to speak on this group of amendments but I rise to try to demolish the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the amendment would not transfer a farrago such as the Ginns and Gutteridge Crematorium Bill to the Floor of the House, nor would it allow even my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South, or other Labour Members whose ingenuity is colossal, to hold up proceedings on a prayer in the same way as can be done during a Bill's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham is wrong: accepting the amendment would not open up
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
anything like the procedures that he suggests, least of all what happened in the Ginns and Gutteridge Crematorium Bill. I, too, was the Chairman of a private Bill Committee. It rejected theBill, mainly on the grounds that the planning considerations prior to its being presented to Parliament were inadequate. In addition, it did not require parliamentary powers to do what was wanted. It could have been done by changing the rules for the presentation of Bills so that they should have to go through all outside planning procedure prior to approval by Parliament, but that is another issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham was surprised when I questioned the absolute powers of a Minister in law. In that context, I mention Oxleas wood, which was to be destroyed rather than a tunnel being constructed. That caused enormous public anxiety throughout the country. The right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), who was Secretary of State for the Environment, had exercised the very power that the hon. Gentleman claims does not exist, despite the fact that Oxleas wood is a site of special scientific interest. All that was required was a tunnel of 200 or 300 yards, with some cuttings and a few houses either side. There was an enormous furore, of which the Committee is aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A railway might require four or five tunnels, bridges, embankments or viaducts. The Secretary of State could take the same decisions as he did in respect of a small section of motorway and arbitrarily overturn the findings of an inquiry by a public inspector. The decision on Oxleas wood defied common sense in every respect and such decisions could be replicated many times when a railway is involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are considering an enabling measure that will allow many powers available to the House to be handled by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two different views are held on enabling legislation; some people are strongly for it and some want everything to be dealt with in Parliament. On one hand there are those who adopt the views of Adolf Hitler, who used enabling legislation to carry out whatever he wanted, and of the militant tendency, who argue for enabling legislation in the interests of large, important transformations of society. On the other hand there are those who want every minute detail to be considered. The House, however, was founded and developed on some of the those minute details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the Transport and Works Bill; much of the legislation on which the House is founded arose from private, local Bills—specific measures, especially in the 19th century, for the development of railways. That does not mean that such legislation should be kept in mind for ever, because circumstances change. However, there is a peculiarity about transport legislation. Yesterday I was in European Standing Committee A considering a proposal from the European Commission on speed limiters. I presume that eventually it will be adopted on a majority vote by the Council of Ministers. There are articles of the treaty—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many transport matters that require scrutiny are being removed from consideration by the House, and that affects the Bill. A measure decided at Maastricht in connection with article 75 of the treaty of Rome affects current developments, and the Bill adds to that pattern. It is the complexity of these issues that we should be worried about. The Bill does not propose that these matters should continue to be tackled by private Bills or by some other measure in the House. There should be a safety valve so that these issues can be raised in Parliament. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) argued that point powerfully and expertly. The Committee should consider the matter seriously. The point deals with procedures and democratic and constitutional matters, not with the substance of the Bill. It goes to the heart of parliamentary procedures.

The amendments seek to acknowledge the complexity and weight of the measures while maintaining a stopgap parliamentary control. I accept that some measures should be transferred for consideration elsewhere. A Bill was considered in the House to build two storeys on the Adelphi building on the Embankment. The relevant legislation went back to the 17th century; some 1932 legislation was also relevant to it. The matter was scrutinised and it was agreed that it should be transferred elsewhere. The Bill includes transferring measures, but it should also contain a stopgap provision to give Parliament the opportunity to act if the discretion used by the Minister is deemed to be excessive. Perhaps future Ministers will not be nice guys, such as the current Minister. They may try to misuse their authority. It is right that hon. Members, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South should be able to scrutinise the issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have listened carefully to my hon. Friends and Conservative Members during debates on railways. I have often admired and inwardly cursed the ingenuity that they sometimes use in their arguments.
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
I have always admired my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South—I hope that I do not condemn him by saying that—who has a special brand of ingenuity. However, I remind him and some of my other hon. Friends that some people outside the House are interested in railways—some work in the railway industry. They do not understand our more arcane parliamentary procedure. Some of them read 
	<i>Hansard,</i> and they write to me, and say, "I thought that you wanted to make sure that some railway scheme would go through as quickly as possible, but 
	<i>Hansard</i> shows that Members of Parliament have introduced matters that have nothing to do with that scheme". I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) that, for various hisorical reasons, almost every length of new railway line and railway sleeper has to be covered by, usually, a British Railway general powers Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sympathy with the amendment, but I remind my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East that under existing procedures, which, as the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) said, the Joint Committee seeks to change, it is possible to use parliamentary ingenuity to cause considerable delays to works. I suspect that is one reason why the Joint Committee recommended a change in our procedures. Many of my hon. Friends have made it clear over the years that they sympathise with railway developments and want road and rail schemes to be treated in the same way. But if the amendment is accepted, that still will not be true. Certain railway matters will be debated in the House, but we shall continue to build roads as we have done for years.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that it would depend on the number of instruments that the Government tabled. But, as I showed in my speech, instruments made under clause 1 and clause 3 spread to almost half of the Bill. I would expect that if an application were made under the rules outlined in the Bill, one instrument would cover a tramway, railway or trolley-vehicle system so the debate would last one hour or a maximum of one and a half hours if the prayer was given time, which would depend on the Front Bench's willingness to argue the case with the Government. Therefore, there would be a veto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That presupposes that hon. Members, such as myself, who share my hon. Friend's interest in railways would still be around to exercise that discretion. I understand my hon. Friend's point, but I hope that he appreciates my desire to quantify road and rail schemes in the same way. I do not wish to undermine his amendment, but unless my hon. Friend can reassure me, I shall hesitate to accept a proposal that would further allow the delay of such essential schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The orders could come into operation whenever the Secretary of State chose. They would not necessarily have to lie for 21 days before being used, which is the usual convention. If a matter were urgent, for example, it could come into operation on the day after it had been laid. The prayer could be taken when the order was operating. The system is flexible. The negative procedure instrument, in which a prayer would have to be tabled, would cause no delay. It is minor long-stop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to these important amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has happened accidentally on a procedural matter of profound importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be accidental.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. What is important is not just the opportunity for a debate, but the opportunity to have a debate and a vote enshrined in an Act or in subsequent standing orders that would enable Back Benchers to have much more influence on the Secretary of State. It would need only "X" or
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
"Y" number of Members to say that they would abstain or vote the other way to exert the necessary pressure on the Secretary of State. Therefore, the possibility of a debate and vote, even if that does not take place, is of profound democratic, parliamentary and constitutional importance and adds even greater weight to the importance of my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South seems to have an astonishing faith in the lack of effectiveness of the Government Whip's Office when these matters are debated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: South London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that is a term of abuse or a geographical fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Channel tunnel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hope that a major scheme, such as the Channel tunnel, would be authorised by the Secretary of State. There would have to be a proper debate, proper scrutiny and proper opportunity for those affected by such a scheme to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, I have witnessed the delay of fairly minor national but important local railway schemes due to the ingenuity of hon. Members raising railways matters in their areas. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish was an expert in demanding meetings with the then chairman of the British Railways Board to preserve a shuttle train service between Stockport and Stalybridge—while he rode on it. I was a guard on it at one time and knew it well. It was important to preserve such a link, although it was difficult to appreciate that when, to get a meeting with the Secretary of State, my hon. Friend used parliamentary procedures to block Bills that would have brought railway benefits to other parts of the country. That cannot be done for road schemes under any parliamentary procedures. If it were possible to block such road schemes, some Government, regardless of party, would have taken action to prevent it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wait for my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South to clarify the points that have been raised. I hope that he appreciates the fears that I, as a former railwayman, have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak, but my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East has tempted me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The blackmail activities in which I and others were involved in regard to British Rail were not particularly desirable features of parliamentary activity, although they were legitimate tactics in trying to keep the railway link for my constituency, and in getting a railway line into Manchester airport as well as in regard to the battle over the sleepers to Manchester. Such tactics will no longer be possible, whether the Bill is amended or not because reference
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
will have to be made to specific schemes. So if it were proposed to improve the railway line in West Bromwich—or Sandwell, as it is called these days—we should not be able to bring into the argument the benefits to Stockport of the railway line. I am not complaining about losing those powers; we shall have to find other ways to apply pressure on Ministers to further projects in our constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciated that if we were discussing railway improvements in West Bromwich—I assure him that they are long overdue—it would not be possible to raise matters concerning Stockport, although, if the Committee accepts the amendment, it might be possible to raise several railway schemes, albeit in a specific fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South shakes his head. Given my hon. Friend's ingenuity, surely he would be tempted to say, "I want to discuss every one of these specific schemes" and to repeat it until the chairman of the British Railways Board agreed to meet him and restore the Staleybridge to Stockport service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is referring to procedure. All I am asking for is the ability to table a prayer. I see from today's Order Paper that there have been more than 300 early-day motions, but they mean nothing. They do not give us a chance to scrutinise. Hon. Members can table as many prayers as they like, but that does not necessarily mean anything. We have to go through the procedure to which my hon. Friend referred—lobbying Whips and making a fuss if we want a prayer debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a prayer relates to a problem in a particular Member's constituency, the Whips may say that the issue justifies an hour and a half upstairs in Committee, but if it is tabled as a bit of blackmail and relates to something else in another part of the country, I can imagine what Whips on both sides will say about the chances of it making progress. If the Committee agrees to the amendment, railway matters will not be subject to the blackmail tactics to which they were subject in the past. I believe that my hon. Friend's fears are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause highlights a series of problems with the Bill. Too much power is being handed over to Ministers and civil servants without the longstop of parliamentary scrutiny. By making a concession in the clause, the Minister could avoid a series of debates. If we receive a concession now, we shall retain the long-stop of parliamentary control, but if we do not, we shall have to consider whether the Minister should decide when a scheme has national significance and to whom he will delegate powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 would deal with a series of problems. Our debate has been lengthy, but if the Minister could assure the Committee that he would either accept the amendment or deal with the problems through the Bill, we could make progress. A discussion on whether we would still be debating the matter on Christmas eve or Christmas day would then be irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am mindful of the words of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), who said that the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) would wish to reply to the debate. I remind the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East that when we began our proceedings today, the hon. Member for Bradford, South was replying to our previous debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some points that I made on Tuesday in answer to the hon. member for Bradford, South are relevant to the comments that he made today. I shall not repeat them. Out debate began at 11.50 am on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some interesting matters have emerged from the debate. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East referred to the performance of the hon. Member for Bradford, South when he was a distinguished member of the previous Government. The hon. Member for Bradford, South replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was never accused of exercising power arbitrarily because the then Secretary of State was cautious about giving me any power at all."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 10 December 1991; c. 25.]</p></blockquote>
I believe that the Secretary of State to whom the hon. Gentleman referred was the former Member for Chesterfield. Had the present right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) been his Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Bradford, South would have been given more leeway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, South informed the Committee of the impossibility of making a prayer on the Floor of the House without the agreement of Front-Bench spokesmen. It is clear that those of us who are not experts in parliamentary procedure will learn more about it. However, in column 27 of the 
	<i>Official Report,</i> the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish told the Committee about George Cunningham's ability to get prayers debated in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three amendments represent three different suggestions for dealing with a problem. The hon. Member for Bradford, South tabled amendment No. 32, which would provide the opportunity for a prayer. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish suggests that after all the stages proposed in the Bill have been completed, Parliament should have the ability to amend the orders. The hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) suggests that every resolution should come before Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), who explained the reasoning behind the Joint Committee's views. With respect to the hon. Member for Bradford, South, my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham made an important point. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bradford, South is not satisfied with the old arguments about the way in which statutory instruments are debated. However, we are bound by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. As my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham said, the matter is meant for wider consideration than that of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will not do. The argument about wider consideration is unacceptable.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
We are considering a major constitutional matter. If we get it right in the Bill, it will be reasonable to alter planning legislation and to bring that into line with the measure. It is important that we get it right. It would be reasonable for the Minster to claim that he did not wish to alter the planning legislation. However, it is unreasonable to claim that the matter should be resolved elsewhere. If we are to deal with the matter, we should do so in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bradford, South mentioned a number of statutory instruments, which—he seemed to claim—had been dealt with unsatisfactorily. I look forward to debating that in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 24 permits the Secretary of State to appoint someone to make recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be clear. We are talking about somebody being given the power to make orders that are not necessarily linked to public inquiries, which can be dispensed with, and orders that are not linked to public inquiries because national schemes are not involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The precedent for that is in schedule 6 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which is used for minor classes of planning appeals. The persons appointed under that provision are planning inspectors. At some stage, we may consider being more specific about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the hon. Member for Bradford, South to say that if we follow the procedure that he has laid out, the debate would take only an hour and a half, less Divisions, after 10 o'clock. Of course he is right technically. However, he has overlooked the point about time, which was made to him frequently on Second Reading. We shall have to discuss that in greater detail—my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham has tabled an amendment to deal with it. Hon. Members were anxious about the time that inquiries would take and about how long it would be before the Secretary of State could make the order. The hon. Member for Bradford, South might say that it would take only an hour and a half to debate an order, but, as he well knows, it must be laid and could be prayed against for 40 sitting days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the way in which the parliamentary year runs, it is possible for a delay of four or five months, which is unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can start the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, it almost makes a nonsense of wanting the procedure that the hon. Gentleman is proposing. It would be unwise to start it if there were a possibility of it being prayed against and of the House ultimately rejecting it. Therefore, any work started would be wasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If orders are delayed for five or six months, the Minister should ask his officials why that is so because they should be drawn up in conjunction with any works that are required and presented efficiently and effectively to Parliament.
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
As he knows well, with the majority of prayers, the 40 days elapse and then there must be a revocation order, not a prayer against the instrument, because the procedures are so lacklustre. The Minister is trying to assert that prayers have been important and have offered a virtual right of veto. However, their effect is merely to bring an order to the attention of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that there could be a delay of four to five months because of the way in which the parliamentary year works, not because of the time that it takes to prepare an order. That is not satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a valid point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of argument, because I believe that it is a valid point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister should explain to the officials who make statutory instruments in his Department that they should know from the rules when the 40 days will elapse. If an instrument is made on 1 August, it might be difficult to ensure the required number of parliamentary days, but there would be no difficulty if the instrument were made in June. It does not require much pre-planning to decide when to make instruments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be responsible for saying when the inspector will report. I expect a better argument than that from the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish. I do not know how long a report will take or how much time is needed to make the subsequent order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that the amendment will avoid delay is not valid and I ask my hon. Friends to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seized with the Minister's concern about delay. Although I agree with him—without necessarily accepting his argument—does not that predicate the important point about the time taken for the inquiry? The Minister must surely remember some of my suggestions that would speed up the time taken by a public inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There must be a balance between trying to speed up an inquiry and ensuring that those who wish to make representations can do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about the draconian powers that the Bill will give the Secretary of State, but it allows a locus standi. It is wrong to say that the Bill gives powers only to Ministers. That is not the idea behind it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw the momentary glimpse of pleasure that crossed your face, Mr. Lamond, when it was suggested that I might speak again, and I should hate to disappoint you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no parallel between the private Bill procedure and the order-making procedure. A private Bill might be opposed for reasons not directly connected with that Bill. This is a relatively minor
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
matter, which applies to about 1,500 orders a year, of which perhaps 20 or 30 a year are debated. Nevertheless, it provides a long stop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public inquiries are involved in motorway building because compulsory acquisition of land is necessary. Side road orders are also required for connections with the motorway. Of course, I want roads and railways to be four square.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister keeps repeating that any powers are linked to public inquiries, but he knows that orders can be made without regard to public inquiries. Indeed, the Minister could even dispense with public inquiries in the compulsory purchase of common land. I want to ensure that a procedure that is well-known to hon. Members, but little used, is not curtailed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East that if the two Front Benches take 20 minutes apiece to put their case, little time is left for Back Benchers to make any mayhem. The time allotted is strictly an hour and a half. It is important to retain a degree of scrutiny, but my modest plea seems to be falling on deaf ears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) The Secretary of State shall not make an order under this section if in his opinion the primary object of the order could be achieved by other means.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 2, in clause 3, page 2, line 12, after "by", insert "other".</p>

	<p>No. 3, in clause 3, page 2, leave out line 13.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hazard a guess—perhaps recklessly—that these amendments will not cause as much controversy as the previous group. The amendment would prevent an order being made under the new power contained in clause 1 if some other power exists and can be used to achieve the primary object of the order. The wording is based on that contained in clause 3 in relation to orders under the Harbours Act 1964. The principle is one that applies at present to private Bills. They are used as a last resort only when no other procedure is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scope of orders under clause 1 is very wide. All matters listed in schedule 1 can be the subject of an order. Unless the principle of the amendment is
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
accepted, there could be a flood of applications for orders. Many organisations, including the Ramblers Association, have made representations about the Bill. They consider that it would be wrong if, for example, an order was made under the clause 1 power solely to divert or close a footpath. It is the primary object of the order which determines the power to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are consequential to amendment No. 1. Clause 1 ensures that the powers under the Harbours Act 1964 will be used in preference to clause 3 powers. The amendments apply that same principle to all other powers that could be exercised under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman about what the amendments are trying to achieve, but I shall explain why they are not acceptable. We want to ensure that orders containing provisions which are outside the purpose of the order-making system are sent back to the applicant for amendment to remove the offending parts. We intend to issue guidelines which, among other things, will say that we shall not entertain abuses of the system of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that amendment No. 1 could negate the Bill's main objective of replacing the private Bill procedure. If the Secretary of State was unable to make an order where the primary purpose could be achieved by other means, the promoter could say that the "other means" was private legislation. Certainly, it would leave some uncertainty about the Secretary of State's powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, the amendment would not be effective when an applicant for an order for, say, a new railway line sought powers to stop up a footpath unrelated to the project. The latter proposal would clearly be an ancillary matter, so the amendment in itself would not prevent the Secretary of State from making the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that if an order was made which included such an abuse of the system, it would be challenged in the courts on the ground that the Secretary of State had exceeded his powers, because it is a general rule that if there is a particular remedy one should not use something wider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 do not achieve what is intended for the same reasons that I have just given. The reason for clause 3(2) is that circumstances could arise where there is a genuine doubt about whether the order should be dealt with under the new order making or under a harbour order. An example would be a proposal to carry out works on an inland waterway, which was also a harbour, or to build an energy barrage in a harbour incorporating a marina. The latter would be for a harbour purpsose and would therefore be suitable for a harbour order, but the energy barrage might not. In that case, the proper route would be decided by which aspect was deemed to be the primary purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those explanations have given the hon. Gentleman some reassurance and that the guidelines that we shall issue will cover the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed in looking for concessions from the Minister. I understand his first point that, if the primary objective cannot be achieved by any other means, one might suggest a private Bill. But it would be a simple challenge to the Bill's draftsman to make it clear that private Bills were not to be an alternative. Although I understand the Minister's valid objection to the amendment as drafted, he could not object if the amendment were rewritten. The Minister could give an undertaking to have that done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need a stronger statement from the Minister than the one that the Government intend to issue because the Government can issue different sets of guidance. The present Minister may be quite clear that he does not intend to use the power in the way that we do not want, but, in future, another Minister may interpret the clause more widely and issue a new set of guidance. Therefore, there are some advantages in an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, a private Bill must go to the Court of Referees, which is entitled to stop the Bill at that stage by saying that the aim can be achieved by other means. If the Court of Referees does not stop the Bill, the Committee that considers it can do so. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South pointed out that the Hampshire (Lyndhurst Bypass) Bill was thrown out on the grounds that the same purposes could be achieved by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not wish to use the exact wording of the amendment but it would be helpful to spell out in the Bill that the Government do not intend to allow people to introduce under the procedure anything that is not strictly relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the north of England, people are concerned about footpaths. Your constituency, Mr. Lamond, like mine is close to the Pennines and it has an attractive network of footpaths that leads out onto the moors. It is difficult for local people to keep a check on all attempts to close footpaths. Some local authorities have used powers under the magistrates courts to do so. There have been many campaigns against it. The Ramblers Association has managed to stop local authorities from using magistrates courts and the Department of the Environment has issued directives that they should not close footpaths under that procedure. Sadly, every so often, a local authority tries it on. People who are anxious to protect footpaths must watch out for that. The must also look out for the closure and diversion orders that local authorities may make through the existing procedures. In addition, they must examine private Bills. Nationally, that is easy for the Ramblers Association, but difficult for people on a local basis. People must look at the measures on highways and, in future, on railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be reasonable for people to check for footpaths crossing a proposed light rapid transport system and then assert that a ridge, an underpass or a diversion would have to be included. However, if another footpath can be closed, even though it is not directly affected by the proposed new road, that extends the need for people to carry out scrutiny and

makes matters much more difficult. Even if they do not accept the amendment, it would be helpful for the Government to include in the Bill an acknowledgement that areas ancillary to schemes, but not essential to them, will not be dealt with in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will at least be prepared to consider that and let us have a more precise proposal on Report rather than leave it to guidance through regulations or a circular. I plead with the Minister to have another look at this. It would help to oil the wheels of the procedure if he were at least to agree to listen to the Committee and make a few alterations. However, if he insists that everything should remain as it is, we must begin to wonder about the point of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not make the progress that I had anticipated when I met the hon. Lady.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the Minister wants to do this by way of the rules, but one can always change the rules. If we put the proposal in the Bill, it is there. Why does the Minister want to do this through the rules rather than putting it in the Bill? The only explanation is that at some time in the future he will want to make a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

change all the rules. That is not the aim. However, I shall certainly consider whether this measure should be written into the Bill. We can return to that point on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) asked how I could stop a flood of applications being made. I cannot. If applications are outside the scope of the Bill, we will not be able to act on them. I cannot say that we will not have many applications—I have no way of knowing. We may not receive very many. I do not believe that a great flood of applications is waiting. However, the current procedure is not wholly satisfactory when one considers incidents that have taken place on railway lines in the not-too-distant past and the outcry that follows about why a particular footpath has not been closed after such an awful and tragic accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see this as a gateway to numerous stoppages and closures, partly because of the Ramblers Association, which I have met on several occasions. Indeed, my local group in Amber Valley is quite effective in monitoring these issues. I hope that I have said enough to enable the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a considerable debate on this clause and I have no wish to return to any of the points that have just been covered. However, I should like to raise one matter with the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 of the notes on clauses, which the Under-Secretary has been kind enough to provide, refers to the arrangements for private legislation in Scotland. I know that the hon. Gentleman has already spoken to his hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Adley), my co-chairman on the all-party railways group. To paraphrase the hon. Member for Christchurch, the question of private railways in Scotland was raised on Second Reading. There is a problem there, given the new regulations. I understand that under the new procedures it will be necessary for non-statutory railway bodies—the privately owned railways—to use London solicitors and parliamentary agents. As my hon. Friends have already made quite plain, that is an expensive business. I hope that the Under-Secretary can give us an assurance that the present system, whereby the Scottish Office processes these applications, will continue so that that considerable expense will not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
incurred by railway systems run largely by volunteers conscious of the burdens inflicted on them by heavy outgoings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's anxiety. The Association of Railway Preservation Societies Ltd. has made representations to the Minister and I wonder whether he intends to table amendments to enable the Scottish procedure to be retained. Many of the railway schemes were set up with relatively small amounts of capital and it would further jeopardise those ventures if expensive legal procedures were required. I speak from experience as the founder and, for 10 years, the chairman of the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway Preservation Society, now a successful, privately operated railway company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the railway was first opened in 1968, we started with a total issued capital of £3,500. That was worth a great deal more then than it would be now, but even now no one would pass a pile of £3,500 lying on the floor. However, it was a relatively small amount. We were assisted by a solicitor who provided his services absolutely free—which, as we know, is unusual in the legal profession. No one can guarantee that that sort of voluntary contribution will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, there are several interesting and useful preserved lines, for example, the Aviemore to Boat of Garten line, I remind the Minister that the lines in Scotland are often more difficult to operate by the amateurs who run them because they are more remote than the Keighley and Worth Valley railway, which is near the important industrial conurbations of Leeds, Bradford, Nelson, Colne, Burnley and so on. That is an additional factor to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will agree that these minute fragments of what were once British Rail tracks should be encouraged and not subject to an unnecessarily expensive, bureaucratic procedure. I look forward to hearing what encouragement the Minister will give to the Association of Railway Preservation Societies Ltd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the new spirit of cordiality in this Committee, I hope the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish is keeping a list. He said that although on some occasions I give way, I have not done that so far in this Committee. I gave him an undertaking on one occasion and I now give him the same undertaking as I gave to the hon. Members for West Bromwich, East and for Bradford, South. On Monday night, I met a group of people who urged me to keep the Scottish light railway system. I consulted colleagues, and I can tell the Committee that we are prepared to meet that request and to table the necessary amendments to cover the points raised by the hon. Members for West Bromwich, East and Bradford, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin the debate on amendment No. 22, which is on the provisional selection list, I must tell the Committee that the word "provisional" means that an amendment can be removed from that list at any time. Having considered that fact, and the lengthy debate on a similar subject in clause 1, I am tempted to de-select the amendment. However, rather than be accused of Stalinist tactics, which I know hon. Members would regard as extremely unjust, I have decided not to deselect it, but I expect the debate to be considerably shorter than the debate on the same subject under clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"; no such orders shall be made unless a draft of the instrument containing them has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your remarks, Mr. Lamond, but you must be aware that there is a difference between the two debates. In the amendments that we debated under clause 1 we were talking about the negative procedure; here we are discussing the affirmative procedure. Although amendments Nos. 27 and 38 would have widened the scope to affirmative and amendable affirmative orders, in this case I merely want to raise the level of parliamentary accountability from the negative procedure that the Minister has ventured to include in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments about the difficulties of prayers, time and allocations seem magically to have disappeared on clause 2, which prescribes modes of guided transport for the purposes of clause 1(1)(d). I suppose that it could include systems such as magnetic levitation, which has not been developed in this country because the Government cut research funds. I understand that it is now being developed elsewhere. It could also include monorails, overhead rail systems, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of the minor procedure of negative instruments and prayers, there should be an affirmative order. In case it is suggested that this is the dizzy heights of frenzied democracy at work, I point out that affirmative orders are normally subject to a debate of an hour and a half after 10 o'clock at night on the Floor of the House or in Committee upstairs at 10.30 am. I call them merit Committees because they refer to the merits of the instrument. When in Committee, the Government have the
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
inconvenience of maintaining a quorum. Ministers usually say something along the lines of "I move that this instrument be reported to the House as having been considered" and then sit down. If I am present, I ask the Minister to give an explanation. Shamefaced, Ministers do that and sometimes a debate follows. On a recent occasion when I was present the debate used the full hour and a half; it was an interesting, informative debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders will classify a relatively new form of transport. Instead of depending on hon. Members tabling a prayer and possibly obtaining a debate of an hour and a half under the negative procedure, we should have an affirmative procedure. The instrument must be subject to the affirmative procedure so that we can go into the reasons why the Minister has chosen a particular form of transport. For example, it might concern magnetic levitation and the Minister might want to comment on the extra costs involved or the degree of reliability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A strong case can be made for encouraging experimental forms of transport on, for example, a minor stretch of land so that it can be introduced on a bigger basis. The Minister would want the opportunity to explain the Government's thinking. That is why the matter should be subject to the affirmative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is modest; it asks the Minister to upgrade the procedure slightly. I hope that you will not mind my mentioning democratic accountability again, Mr. Lamond. In case anyone suggests it, the amendment does not reintroduce the private Bill procedure; it merely gives Parliament a taste and allows the Minister to say why he has made a decision. I do not accept that a report by 10 or a dozen Members of Parliament should be considered as tablets of stone. Members of the Committee have an equally valid view, and there is no reason why our views should not be considered and translated into legislation. I hope that the Minister will accept that in a spirit of conciliation. I had nothing but a spirit of conciliation when I began what I intended to be brief remarks this morning, but I was repeatedly interrupted and my remarks stretched out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise in the spirit that has been mentioned. The Minister has given us two "maybe's" and a "yes", so we are not doing too badly. He could give us another "yes" in respect of the matter that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 deals with what is known, but it is qualified by clause 2, which deals with the unknown. The items to which clause 1 refers—the railway, the tramway and the trolley system—are largely environmentally friendly, though they may not be attractive at the bottom of one's garden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 deals with the unknown. We can speculate about new systems of transport and hope that their design will be environmentally friendly, but we cannot be certain. It would be reasonable for ministers to explain the basis of new systems and for hon. Members to question whether such systems would be environmentally friendly or involve a noise penalty, problems with magnetic fields or other difficulties. The Minister could easily accept that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
such matters should be subject to public scrutiny. If the system was uncontroversial, it could be dealt with quickly by the House of Commons. If it was controversial, there could be a proper debate in which the pros and cons would be raised and Parliament could decide. I hope that the Minister will make another concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the contention of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South. I do not accept the Select Committee's recommendations as holy writ. In any case, its specific recommendations were confined to British Rail. It recommended:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In principle, in cases where planning considerations are dominant, all works proposals for which private Bill approval is presently required should instead be authorised through non-parliamentary procedures involving the holding, where necessary, of a public local inquiry into objections."</p></blockquote>
That recommendation has been broadly interpreted to include all forms of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South said, we are discussing the future. I stress the difference between mode and technique. The techniques of the future may require new laws and the resolution of many problems. I shall conclude on a futuristic note, but one that is not beyond the realms of possibility with the motorways becoming so jammed. Let us suppose that someone devised an economical method of transferring a capsule the size of the Room on a concrete channel from here to Edinburgh at 400 miles an hour. That might come within the purview of the clause. Twenty or 30 years hence it would be preferable to examine the matter under an affirmative order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be the last to suggest that a course of action should acquire the status of a holy writ simply because a Select Committee had recommended it. I served on the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, its conclusions were very good and I am delighted that they are being translated into practice. However, I would be the first to disclaim their sanctity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the scheme that the hon. Member for Newham, South outlined. I hope that I shall be around in 40 years to see it. I assure him that the scheme would be regarded as nationally significant and would, therefore, be covered by the Bill. However, I take his point. I accept that the cases that he mentioned would be few and far between and that the procedure would not be used very often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, South made a valid point. I assure him that I shall consider the matter and I may return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for and surprised by the Minister's helpful comment. In view of your remarks, Mr. Lamond, I have tried to be brief. Does the Minister's reassurance apply to amendment No. 23, which related to interference
	<br><blockquote><p>"with rights of navigation in waters within or adjacent to England and Wales, up to the seaward limits of the territorial sea"?</p></blockquote>
As the Minister knows, members of the Committee have received complaints about the inclusion of
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
waterways in the Bill. An affirmative procedure would render that provision more accountable. Will the Minister consider that, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little careful about getting into the Christmas spirit so far from Christmas in case more is expected of me next week. I shall consider what the hon. Gentleman said, but I am dealing with amendment No. 22, not amendment No. 23—although I accept that they are in the same group. Amendment No. 22 does not constitute a major move away from the Select Committee's recommendation. I shall consider the matter. I hope that the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to accept the Minister's invitation. I hope that he will examine both amendments and I am pleased that he will examine the possibility of affirmative procedure. It will not be used on many occasions—there will be, perhaps, two or three cases every 10 years. I accept the Minister's comments about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reflect on the inclusion of waterways in the Bill because a large number of representations have been made about it. I am also disturbed that, while we consider the Bill, the British Waterways Bill is being considered by the House of Lords. We must be clear about which legislation is the most important. Will the Bill subsume, overlap or replace any private legislation that is being considered in the House of Lords? The Minister has an opportunity to clarify the position and to ensure that the powers set out in the Bill, which would not be used very frequently, can be considered in the form of affirmative orders? I look forward to the Minister coming forward with a suitable amendment on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give a brief welcome to you, Mr. Lamond. I shall be brief in speaking to the amendment if the Minister will assure us that he will make some concessions on the inland waterways. Many of my hon. Friends feel as strongly as I do that, although we might agree with the Bill's provisions on private Bill procedure, and although we want some integrated way of dealing with all forms and modes of transport, we can co-operate only so much. The inclusion of inland waterways in the Bill with a complete lack of consultation with the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council raises many questions. I have serious misgivings about the reasons behind the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendments because consultation with the bodies concerned should be written ino the Bill and should not be included in the rules. An enormous amount of preparation has gone into the Bill. There have been various committees and much attention has been paid to railways and bringing railways under the same procedures that deal with roads. We have heard nothing about the degree or consultation on inland waterways. It is breathtaking that the Government—I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee why in his reply—can present the Bill after detailed consultation with everybody involved except on the matter of inland waterways. IWAAC was set up as a statutory body to advise the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport under the Transport Act 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The language that everybody is using is about roads and railways. The previous amendments related to affirmative orders of the House. Affirmative orders are fine if they apply to railways, yet we can already see the hesitation from the Minister about allowing a similar concession to apply to the clauses relating to inland waterways. We therefore feel that the Government must write into the Bill a genuine commitment to proper consultation with the relevant bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will give his reasons for not having consulted. He might even say that he thought that the Department of the Environment was doing it and that there was no need for the Department of Transport to do it. If that is the case, it will raise all manner of questions about the degree of competence of the Department of Transport and the Minister himself even to know what the Department of the Environment is doing when it concerns our whole waterways heritage. Is it sufficient
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
for the Government to allow one Department to hand over to another Department matters that are so crucial when it comes to the operation of matters of transport?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also been told that the Government will supersede these private Bill procedures in favour of planning procedures. There is grave doubt about how much the planning procedures will take that into account. How can we have faith in the whole philosophy of the Bill if the Government have completely neglected to consult the Inland Waterways Association or the other bodies that are concerned? That lack of confidence and the huge mistake that the Government have made have led us to argue that the proceedings should go as slowly as possible until we have had proper and genuine consultation about what should be in the Bill, and until a commitment is written into the Bill ensuring that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has already been made to the number of organisations and individuals from the areas where there are many canals. No one is able to account for the Government's exclusion of the views; it has made people extremely suspicious about their real intentions. If the Bill's intention is to improve the private Bill procedure relating to the construction of new operations, that is fine. However, the Government's attitude and the way that they have dealt with the aspects relating to inland waterways leads me to feel that the disquiet that may well be felt now in another place about the other Bill should also be shared here. It begs the question whether the clauses on inland waterways should be included in the Bill because the Government are trying to apply one set of procedures to something that bears no resemblance at all to the construction of new inland waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Bill is effectively attempting to do, in a backhand way, is to curtail the scope of inland waterways and to curtail the role which British waterways play in our heritage. Two Bills are being dealt with simultaneously. The Government have failed to write into the Bill effective consultation with even the statutory body that was set up to deal with it. It is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might well have made a statement to tell the Committee that he has made up for his failure to consult, that he has already had discussions with various organisations and that he now proposes to come back either to the Committee or at a later stage of the Bill's proceedings and tell us how he has taken on board those concerns, particularly the lack of consultation. We do not want the Minister to come with an assurance that could perhaps be incorporated into rules. We want a clear commitment to ensure that the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council will be properly consulted. We have tabled the amendments for that reason. If the Government do not take notice of a statutory body, I am not confident that they can produce the statutory framework for IWWAC. If the Minister will make concessions we must know what they are at an early stage so that we can plan how to deal with the whole issue. Many people, throughout the country, will press their Members of Parliament to ensure that, if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
the matter is not dealt with now, it will be dealt with later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue of consultation is especially important. Linked with it is the problem of the relationship between the Bill on inland waterways, which is currently being considered by the House of Lords, and this Bill. On Second Reading, we asked the Minister to make clear when this new legislation would come into effect. We asked whether the Government would start to prepare new private Bills for introduction next Session or whether only Bills that are already being considered would be dealt with under the existing procedure. Assuming that the Bill obtains Royal Assent, the new procedure would apply from the start of the next Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular difficulty with the British Waterways Bill being considered by the House of Lords is that people have petitioned against some of its clauses and are fighting to have it changed substantially. People want to be assured that if they are given concessions—to which they are entitled during the Bill's passage through both Houses—they will be genuine and not merely a gesture by the British Waterways Board to ensure that the Bill is passed quickly, in the knowledge that, as soon as this legislation becomes law, it can come back and get the
