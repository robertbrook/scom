	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Sheffield Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The order is required to wind up the Sheffield development corporation. It revokes the 1988 order which designated the urban development area and established the development corporation. It will take effect in two stages. First, it will remove urban development area status on 1 April and, secondly, will revoke on 1 July that part of the 1988 order which established the development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under that two-stage process, the corporation will cease to exercise any operational functions after 31 March 1997. It will then have three months in which to prepare its final accounts, to report and to wind up its affairs. On 1 July, it will finally be dissolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other orders have been laid before the House in respect of the wind-up. One transfers the Sheffield development corporation's planning functions to Sheffield city council on 20 March 1997; the other transfers to the Secretary of State for the Environment those of the corporation's property rights or liabilities that have not been disposed of by 21 March. The orders are subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sheffield development corporation—the SDC—is the fourth urban development corporation in England to wind up. We intend to wind up the remaining eight next year. Urban development corporations—UDCs—were always intended to be short-life bodies, charged with the specific task of bringing economic regeneration, new life and new hope to some of our most severely run-down urban areas. It is precisely because the SDC and the other UDCs have been so successful in meeting their remit that we are able to wind them up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988, the lower Don valley, once considered to be the powerhouse of the world, with a long history of great steel-producing firms—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Caborn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1988, however, it was a very sad place. I am waiting for someone to say, "Hear, hear".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988, there were vast areas of dereliction and decaying, unused buildings, a legacy of manufacturing industries going through hard times with little confidence of any good coming out the other side.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Some steel companies had steered their way through a major restructuring in the industry and were beginning to succeed in the new competitive economic climate. Numerous small companies were just holding on, hoping for something better round the corner. Although there were signs of action—the Meadowhall project was one of note—in reality, the task was too large and too deep-seated for the existing agencies to deal with in any acceptable time scale. Time was important. The city's reputation in the country was poor and confidence in its future was low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Government established the development corporation with a single mission: to regenerate the lower Don valley. Surprisingly—especially in retrospect—not everybody welcomed that move. Some critics claimed that, with the same resources, the city council could have achieved the same results. The corporation had a single-minded approach which focused entirely on regeneration without any competing demands and priorities. It drew on private-sector expertise and built up a regeneration team of considerable expertise. I hope that, after nine years, even those critics think differently. For example, the current leader of Sheffield city council has publicly stated that the transformation in the lower Don valley could not have been achieved without an organisation such as the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth spending a few moments to consider why the SDC gains such praise from so many quarters. I shall touch on a few statistics: when the SDC was set up, 350 hectares out of a total of 800 were derelict and most were held in small parcels. By assembling decent-sized development areas and reclaiming land from past contamination, 239 hectares have been brought back into full use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation followed a professional marketing strategy based on meeting customer needs, aimed at improving the image of the valley and of Sheffield as a whole. As a result, it has succeeded in attracting over £680 million private sector investment. This represents £7 of private money for every £1 of public money invested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Major infrastructure projects have literally forced new life into the area. The £30 million Don valley link spine road has opened up land for development and provided what had previously been lacking—fast links to the city centre and importantly to the motorway network. This has made land alongside the Don valley link particularly attractive to inward investors. Nearly 500,000 sq m of new commercial floor space has been built. From all this 18,000 jobs have been created during the corporation's lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that this jobs figure includes 7,000 jobs in the Meadowhall regional shopping complex, which was planned and started before SDC came along. But we must recognise that it is due to the SDC that thousands of jobs have and will come on board during and after its lifetime as a direct result of its entrepreneurial activities and that 30 million visitors each year are attracted to Meadowhall, many of whom would not otherwise have come to Sheffield. A good number will visit other places in the city and use public transport, all helping the local economy. This was once
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
an area in terminal decline. It has now been brought into the mainstream of a mixed economy. It has a wide variety of employers in manufacturing, distribution, industry, offices and even food production. There is therefore a much wider choice of employment, including part-time employment; yet industry and manufacturing remain important. For example, Sheffield produces more steel now than it did in 1943 at its peak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDC's achievements sound impressive enough. I can assure members of the Committee that they are even more impressive when one has visited Sheffield, as I have. Some hon. Members live in the area and know it well. I have seen the difference that the corporation's hard work has made over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area looks and feels so different, but it has not been an easy ride. The corporation would be the first to acknowledge that there have been setbacks and difficulties in both projects and in establishing working relationships within the city. But overwhelmingly, this is a story of effort rewarded and I congratulate Hugh Sykes, SDC's chairman, his fellow board members and all the corporation's hard working officials who had both the vision and the determination to make things happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two of SDC's projects illustrate how this tenacity has paid off. The first, is the regeneration of Sheffield's historic canal basin, now called Victoria Quays. This area close to the city centre had been derelict for 20 years, unnoticed by most people in Sheffield. The corporation worked in partnership with a number of developers, on refurbishing listed warehouses—while retaining their historical and architectural interest—and on new build schemes which would retain the character of the setting. This has produced a waterside development which the city can be proud of. One of the country's major law firms has moved to the city setting up its northern headquarters on the quays and a further 20,000 sq ft is available for letting; a pub and restaurant—satisfactorily as I can say from my visit—is already open and there is more to come; a four-star hotel will open in the summer and the Halifax has chosen the quays for the location of one of its new businesses. The area also offers a splendid setting for exhibitions and public events. The first and most noticeable was a boating carnival held last summer, attracting more than 60,000 visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second example where SDC's determination has paid off is its success in delivering a city airport for Sheffield. For over 50 years, Sheffield has been talking and speculating about an airport, but the corporation saw the opportunity and was determined that the city should have one. After several difficult years, SDC eventually struck a successful deal with a private developer and the corporation has had the pleasure of seeing the very first plane land on the runway at Tinsley Park. Construction is still under way and oil drums have had to be placed there to prevent enthusiastic amateurs landing illegally. The airport will be fully open later this year. Local businesses will soon benefit from the venture enabling them to deal more quickly and competitively with Europe and other UK centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The corporation's impact is not restricted to the lower Don valley. It has consistently worked to improve the image of Sheffield as a whole. It has taken a leading role in developing local partnerships such as the Sheffield city liasion group and has spearheaded work on a strategy for the city centre. It has helped to lift the awareness of companies looking for new locations that Sheffield might indeed be the right place to consider. This only rarely happened before 1988. It has restored the confidence of developers in the city, especially by its approach to a swift turnround of planning applications. I hope that the city council will pick up and learn from that when the planning functions move back to the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDC has helped transform Sheffield from a city which was unsuccessful in the first two rounds of city challenge to one where partnership is now at the forefront. This has brought success in each of the three rounds of the single regeneration budget challenge fund, totalling £91 million. It has also secured the largest allocation in Yorkshire and Humberside for capital challenge adding just short of £11 million to the city's funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prior to the SDC's designation, the immediate future for the lower Don valley—and perhaps for Sheffield itself—did not look good. Now that the corporation has put in place all the essential ingredients for continuing regeneration, the lower Don valley is well placed for continued growth and prosperity. For those projects which have not been fully completed in the lifetime of the Corporation, it has been at great pains to put suitable succession arrangements in place. The city council, English Partnerships and British Waterways are all playing a key role. The SDC has developed partnership into a new way of doing business in the city. By working together, the partners in Sheffield have already seen greater benefits than could have been achieved separately.
	<br><blockquote><p>"After listing many of SDC's achievements, all these developments have helped create a new Sheffield with a more modern and diversified economy and we must thank SDC for their contribution to reinventing the City".</p></blockquote>
Nice phrase, but not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the testimonial of Sheffield's Labour Lord Mayor who, until recently, was the deputy leader of the council's Labour group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Corporation's task of securing sustainable regeneration of the lower Don valley has been completed. It is right therefore that the corporation should be wound up while we congratulate it on all that it has done. That is why I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.42 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to make it clear to the Committee that the Opposition will not be opposing the order. I was interested to hear the Minister's speech which, when he finished, had moved a great deal from his opening remarks. He ended by acknowledging that partnership is the way forward and that no one sector in our community can deliver regeneration.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Regeneration needs the commitment of everyone and the establishment of a real working partnership between the public, private and voluntary sectors and local people in order to implement change and open up the opportunities that people in our society need for the 21st century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lessons have been learnt from development corporations across the country, including Sheffield's. Future regeneration developments will be different because they will be based on partnership. One sector will not be moved aside to leave the other sector to act, which was the Government's initial drive. They did not like the public sector and wanted it out of the way so that matters were left to the market. The private sector recognised before the Government that the only way forward was to pull everyone together in a real partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I left a conference this morning about new partnerships in local government which was attended by some people from Sheffield. Given that the people who organised that conference also organised last week's conference about the future of industry in the 21st century, I wondered whether the Deputy Prime Minister or the Secretary of State for the Environment might turn up. They had not done so by the time that I had to leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The message from that conference—and the one that we are hearing today—is that partnership is the way forward. The Minister needs to be asked specific questions about the wind up of the corporation and the future of its remaining assets. I hope that I have made clear the Opposition's approach to the corporation and to the order. Two of my colleagues have more experience than I do of the corporation's workings and of the relevant local authority, so I shall leave the detailed questioning to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Irvine Patnick 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister's outline—he gave a skeleton account of the situation in the local area, which we previously knew as Attercliffe but which we now know as the lower Don valley. The hon. Members for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn) and for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) and I hope to put flesh on those bones and, above all, to put the heart into the project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of a booklet called "Sheffield Shines". It does not need words to convey its theme—it uses only pictures. It shows the situation before and after—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Attercliffe may laugh. I clearly remember that he was the council leader at the time, when there was much dereliction in that area. I remember even more clearly that, as a result of his activities in relation to the so-called great scheme that he and his colleagues came up with—it was called the urban regeneration project—I had a most enjoyable evening trying to get the late Nicholas Ridley, who was then the Secretary of State for the Environment, to agree to a development corporation
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
for Sheffield. It was an odd evening. The Government's majority was 102, and Nicholas Ridley decided to see me after a vote—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Caborn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Times have changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Irvine Patnick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman alludes to the great whipping in his party; the whole fortune of the Labour party changed when he went to the Whips Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Secretary of State tried to take me into his room but it was locked, so we decided to use the room of the then Secretary of State for Transport—Cecil Parkinson, as he then was—to discuss this great issue. At that time, when I was a mere Back Bencher, I explained to the Secretary of State that nine more votes were needed. He said, "What a load of rubbish!" and, while he smoked non-stop, he explained in no uncertain terms that there was no way that he could support establishing a development corporation for Sheffield unless I got a letter of support from the then master cutler and the president of the chamber of commerce. The rest is history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SDC package in the lower Don valley changed the environment—it eased access to the area and the surroundings have been made more attractive. It also meant that Sheffield's skilled labour force would be used and it had a knock-on effect on the city. Several projects—including Meadowhall, the Don valley stadium, the arena and the Supertram—were either planned or about to be implemented prior to the SDC's formation. The affected land, which had been derelict for years, was fragmented, had passed through many ownerships and required reclaiming. If the SDC had lacked the relevant powers, it could not have been reclaimed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best description that I can give of the area at that time is that it looked like the aftermath of a blitz. Much work had to be done. As the Minister said, new roads were built, refurbishments were carried out and there was much cleaning, all of which have changed the area. The development itself, like Government, does not create jobs but must create proper conditions for others so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I used to work in the east end of Sheffield, as it was then called, and when I look at the area, which is now called the lower Don valley—I looked around it again as recently as last Friday—I am truly amazed as I compare what it is now with what it was then. The lesson to be learnt by anyone else who comes along with such a project is that the assembly of sites is paramount; easy access to the city centre and the motorway, if there is one, is vital. Money and skills are also required and a focused approach is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work still needs to be done in the area. There is still contaminated land that requires reclaiming and decontaminating. The Minister outlined all the jobs, new roads and new factories in the area. Driving through the area recently, I was most pleased to see the knock-on effect that has been achieved by using SDC money to reshape frontages and put greenery into the area. Ten years ago, no one would ever have thought that this is what Sheffield would be like. It is vital, creative and a very interesting area.

I was most surprised to see one thing in the area and remember saying to the chairman of the SDC, "Look over there." In the heartland—the area that people used to think of as black, dark and dismal, belching out black smoke—people were playing tennis on a tennis court. That shows the significant change in the area. There is an ecology park in the area and I could not believe that the river had been changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the weekend, I was giving a speech at a function, looking back at the birth of the Jewish community in the Sheffield area. There is a walk that people can take around the area, and I found a book entitled "The Early Days of Sheffield Jewry 1760–1900", which has a wonderful piece about a rabbi who was born in Sheffield. Rabbi Edward Lissman was born in Sheffield on 4 July 1870 at Fitzalan Street. He left Sheffield in 1889 and was the founder and rabbi of the Riverside synagogue in 1992. He retired in 1954, but remained rabbi to the fire department and chaplain to New York city well into his 90s. He commented at that time that the River Don flowed red with effluent from steel works. He commented on the fact that buildings in that area were covered in red dust. It was wonderful to see the area and then read his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken up enough of the Committee's time. I join the Minister in complimenting the chairman of the SDC, High Sykes, all the members of the board, past and present, some of whom are members of Sheffield city council, and the chief executive, Graham Kendall. I compliment them on achieving such success in the Don valley, and while many, including myself, would wish to see it continue for a few more months, that would require legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud to have been associated with the SDC since its inception and, as I said before, despite opposition from within the city, everbody now acclaims its success and acknowledges that the knock-on effect on Sheffield has been wonderful. Without the SDC I wonder whether some of the projects in Sheffield would have happened. The SDC has achieved in nine years more than anyone could have imagined in their wildest dreams. It is an example to many and a testimony to few.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr Clive Betts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Sir I. Patnick) said and that is an unusual event in itself. We are glad to see such a good turn out of Conservative Members today; obviously they are scared about the consequences of another defeat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have already said, we shall not oppose the order and it is right that we reflect on what the development corporation has achieved in Sheffield and what more can be done by the city working in partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have before us the document "Sheffield Shines" and I emphasise that that phrase can now apply to the whole of our city. If regeneration has been successful in the lower Don valley—and I believe it has, substantially, on balance—it has also been successful in the whole of Sheffield because the development corporation has contributed to a general move in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
city to regenerate and improve itself, in concert and partnership between the development corporation, the city council and other private and public bodies in the city. The chamber of commerce, the Cutlers' Company, our two universities and many other organisations have all played very important and substantive roles in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I part company slightly with Ministers when they seem to imply that partnership was something which the Government invented in the 1990s or which came about when development corporations were established. We know differently in Sheffield and even the hon. Member for Hallam will probably recognise that working in partnership has started in the mid-1980s before the development corporation came along. The private and public sectors in Sheffield were already working together. Many Labour councils up and down the country were working in partnership with their private sectors at a time when central Government did not want to recognise the importance of local government in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trust that was being built up at that time between the various sectors in our city was a good foundation for what came about and the resources that the development corporation had at its disposal. It has to be seen as part of that wider picture—regeneration of not only the lower Don Valley, but the city as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has already been acknowledged that within the valley, even before the development corporation came into being, there were signs of regeneration taking place. There were plans for leisure facilities—the Don Valley stadium and arena, the Supertram development and the creation of the new technology park—as examples of developments that had already been started. That does not undermine what the development corporation has achieved, but it puts in context again the fact that the regeneration has been part of a wider process with a number of bodies and organisations coming together to work for the collective good of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hallam referred to his role in persuading the then Secretary of State to establish a development corporation for the city. He implied that all that happened was that the Government gave their blessing and asked the chamber of commerce and the Cutlers' Company if they wanted a development corporation and it was then established. I have another bit of that historical jigsaw to fill in this morning because what was not well known at the time was that the Government, through the then Minister, David Trippier, came to the city council privately and discreetly to ask our opinion about what would happen and what our reaction would be to a development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember David Trippier coming to see me when I was leader of the council. He was one of the very few people I have allowed to smoke in my office; when he came with £50 million in his back pocket, that did not seem to be a bad exchange at the time. He asked me openly and fairly what the reaction of the council would be if a development corporation was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
established—would we be willing to work with such an organisation or would we continue to oppose it in principle?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My response was that in principle we were not convinced of the need for development corporations. We were concerned about the transfer of powers from democratically elected bodies to non-elected bodies. I also said that if the Government were to establish a development corporation for the city that resulted in the city getting £50 million and powers to bring together the development process—perhaps by ensuring that some of the various land ownerships referred to by the hon. Member for Hallam were brought together to enable more constructive redevelopment to take place—the city council, on behalf of the people of Sheffield, would act in a pragmatic way, accept the creation of the development corporation and do its best to work with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Irvine Patnick</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a little bit much. I think that I should distance myself from those congratulations, although, as it is a rare moment, I accept the hon. Gentleman's thanks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tried to set the tone which, to a large extent, explains the development corporation's success. In many other areas where development corporations have been established, there has been constant antagonism between them and other bodies in the area which worked against any chance of their being truly successful. In Sheffield, we accepted the Government's intention from the start. The £50 million coming into the city was, in the council's opinion, not something which should be turned to one side, despite our reservations. We sat down and tried to make the best of the opportunity for the city. I am pleased to say that from the appointment of Hugh Sykes as chairman—despite our occasional little arguments on specific issues, some of which I shall mention later—we established a framework for working together in cooperation and partnership which has served the regeneration process in Sheffield well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At its inception, the SDC established the first partnership agreement in the country between a development corporation and a council. I remember spending many hours, perhaps even days, going through drafts of documents with Hugh Sykes, both face to face and in lengthy conversations over the telephone, trying to get the balance right. We both had to persuade others. Colleagues on the council who grudgingly accepted that we could give a nod to the development corporation also thought that getting into bed with them in a partnership agreement was going a bit far. On the other hand, voices in Government were probably saying to people in the development corporation, "Do you really want to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
trust this council because we have had a lot of difficulties with it over the years? Do you really want to come to such a close working relationship with it?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wiser voices prevailed and we established a partnership agreement which lay down a framework for working together, including the process of regular meetings between the two bodies which determined ways in which the development corporation would operate—in consultation with the local community, by making its meetings as open as possible and, of course, by establishing a planning agency which used the city council's experienced planning officers as agents for the development corporation. The agency was successful. There were reservations at the time about whether it would work because it had not worked in other areas. We set it up in Sheffield and made it work together, an approach which should be emphasised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking back on the process, I believe that the development corporation has been a success. Nevertheless, had the Government done things slightly differently back in the 1980s and accepted the report that the city council and the chamber of commerce had commissioned from Coopers and Lybrand, which suggested the setting up of an organisation by the public and private sector in the city—the council and the chamber of commerce—and central Government, greater progress might have been made at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Setting up a new organisation caused a slight hiatus. It had to begin from square one and go through anew and afresh some issues that, on the basis of our earlier partnership work, we might have dealt with a little faster had the Government taken what was, at the time, a slight risk about the sort of partnership they set up. Although that is history, I should like to put it on the record that we agreed with the chamber of commerce that there was a different way to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was, and always has been, our view that the planning process should be part of, and not outside, the democratic process. We believe in that principle. Nevertheless, the development corporation was established in the way in which it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the Minister finally accepted this morning that the Meadowhall shopping complex was given planning permission by the city council before the establishment of the development corporation. That is the case, even if we argue about whether Meadowhall was right or wrong and about what its impact has or has not been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased about the development of Sheffield airport, which I have supported from the beginning. It is in my constituency. I have attended harrowing public meetings where I have been assailed by one or two angry constituents who did not believe that it was a terribly good idea to have an airport on their doorsteps and were not happy about the opencasting that preceded the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that those development decisions were right. The process began with the city council and identified Tinsley park as a site for an airport. We began the consultation process for that airport
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
development, although I accept that, ultimately, planning permission was given by the development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That example shows that, on major issues, the council and the development corporation work together with a long-term vision. Sheffield airport has come about because of that commitment to partnership. Initial public opposition, which arose from the problems that people foresaw from the opencasting at that site, has gone away. Without opencasting, the site could never have been reclaimed and turned into a constructive possibility because the chemical pollution would have remained for ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various organisations in the city including, ultimately, the development corporation, gave the city the possibility of that airport, which was so badly needed and which will prove to be a major aspect of its regeneration and of creating a new image for Sheffield as a whole. We have to keep underlining that fact because it is so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest test of what the development corporation has achieved concerns image. In the mid-1980s, I was not Member of Parliament for Attercliffe. No one who walked down the lower Don valley—which is partly in my constituency and partly in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central—would have been proud to represent that area. It was grimy, dirty and derelict; there were some empty sites; there were sites where some buildings were used and others not; and most sites were in a poor condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, when one walks down the valley, it is a different image. It is somewhere we can take people and say, "This is Sheffield. We're proud to be citizens of Sheffield and Members of Parliament for that city and that area." That change is there for all to see and, as the hon. Member for Hallam said, we do not need words in the booklet explaining it. That is why we are smiling: there are not many words in the booklet because the pictures speak for themselves. That image will initially attract people to the city and encourage them to give it a second look when they consider redevelopment possibilities. That is why the whole process has been so important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development corporation has received £50 million and has been able to focus wholly on its job. I congratulate it on its achievements. As the hon. Member for Hallam mentioned, the canal basin had eluded redevelopment by the city council and others, including the water authorities and the British Waterways Board, for many years. It is great to see that development taking place at the gateway to the city. That is an important and welcome achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The highways proposals for the lower Don valley have also made a great improvement. I pay credit to the development corporation in that respect. In the council, we received some criticisms of the initial plans. We sat down, discussed them and came up with a scheme that everyone in the city felt to be the right one—it has been proved to be the right scheme, undertaken with consultation and in partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only slight criticism of the achievements is that I remain not very enamoured of the idea of another 20-screen cinema complex in my constituency. I added up
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the other day that if all the planning permissions for cinemas that have been granted go ahead, there will be 80 cinema screens in my constituency or within half a mile of it. That is probably more cinema screens than in the west end of London. I am not sure how many screens we think an area such as mine needs. The need is probably misjudged and will have an adverse impact on Sheffield city centre as well as on Rotherham and other centres, too. That is a small caveat, but I must put it on the record because I have been fairly vocal in my condemnation of such planning permission. However, my criticism must be weighed against the other successful regeneration initiatives which I fully support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain what will happen to the development corporation's assets—to the finance and the land that remain to be used? I think that both should be returned to the city council as the appropriate body. The city council will retrieve the planning powers and it will be interesting to find out what happens to the assets. In particular, will the Minister tell us what will happen to the freehold of the airport? I was talking to the airport developers the other day and, apparently, they have a 999-year lease on the land. They are required by the lease to operate in a certain manner. It is important to the agreement for establishing the airport to ensure that the developers abide by the rules. Again, the city council is the appropriate body to take on that responsibility. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether he has made a decision on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To emphasise my comments, the regeneration of Sheffield as a whole has, undoubtedly, been better for having received the £50 million which the development corporation has used to good effect. We can argue about whether the £50 million might have been spent slightly differently or even slightly better by a different organisation, but proof of the corporation's achievement is on the ground. The money could have been spent in such a way as to conflict with the city council and other organisations in the city, which would have been far less helpful. The project has been successful because the development corporation and the council have worked together; they have worked with each other and as part of a wider partnership with public and private bodies—the council has been committed to that for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, we should celebrate a collective success for the city. Sheffield shines in the lower Don Valley and throughout the rest of the city. Sheffield is a good place to invest and the fact that so many people in the city now sing the same tune from the same hymn sheet means that the message will go out. Sheffield will have a prosperous future, building on what the development corporation has achieved. The city will continue to build and to work in that partnership framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), but I remember going into the lobbies one night and David Trippier saying to me, "I've got a chairman for you"—a very active and well-respected business man named Hugh Sykes—"and a deputy chairman, who I am sure you will endorse." I said, "Who's that?" He replied, "Lord Mason from Barnsley." I said, "Bloody hell, it's tribal in South Yorkshire—get somebody from Scotland, but don't get anyone from Barnsley, Rotherham or Doncaster." David Trippier took my advice and returned the following night to say, "I've got you another deputy chairman, Richard." I said, "Who's that?" and he said, "Lord Mulley." I said, "That's a lot better". Lord Mulley was the Member of Parliament for Sheffield, Park before it became Sheffield, Central and I took over. That was my contribution to the structure of the Sheffield development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few serious points need to be made. I re-read a debate in which I participated, which took place back on 28 June 1988—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is on the record. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Hallam read his contribution from that date, but it is interesting; we all make mistakes. I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe about what we were doing in Sheffield prior to the development corporation being established. I know the valley well because I used to work there when I was 15 years old, serving my apprenticeship as an apprentice engineer. It took one hell of a toll in the early 1980s, with the loss of 40,000 jobs in the steel and engineering industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, in the early 1980s, the trade unions and the political and business sectors practised a system called megaphone diplomacy: we used to air all our differences in the local press and radio and it did not do Sheffield any good at all. We sat down and started discussing the way in which we could take Sheffield forward and diversify the economic and industrial base of the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom. After that partnership, which was developing over the 1980s, after we had got shot of the megaphone diplomacy, we were driving for the highest common factor, not the lowest common denominator. We have put the two together, as was proposed in the Coopers and Lybrand report. That was the forerunner of the development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot of what was being done was taken over. Centres of excellence, such as the world student games, were being established. I shall return to that point when I ask the Minister what he will do to help Sheffield continue that diversification of the industrial base and to ensure that the universities will play an active role in the structure; there are now 40,000 students in Sheffield. Clearly, those universities are some of the best in the United Kingdom, if not in Europe, in terms of the engineering and metallurgy departments. We must find ways in which to translate that success into wealth creation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much criticism of the development corporation and its inability to progress the development of the industrial base in Sheffield. While
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I acknowledge that there has been tremendous technological change, we must also accept that the shrinkage of wealth creation that took place in the 1980s is still with us. If one compares us with any major industrial country in the western world, one will find a very small wealth creating base. The development corporation was not assisted to predict new industries and to develop indigenous industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without giving its name, I shall tell a little story about a good company in Sheffield that supplies the aerospace industry and the nuclear power industry and has a 150-year-old building. Company representatives approached me a few months ago and said that they wanted to relocate. I am absolutely convinced that, if relocated, the company's working progress and its ability to plan would make it possible to expand. The company is medium sized, which is very important—a value added, real wealth creation. Yet we treat a 20-screen cinema with more kid gloves than we would the manufacturer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must seriously study how we can help indigenous developing industries such as that company. I am not critical of the development corporation. If one studies the engineering industry, for example, in comparison with the way in which it used to operate, one sees massive improvements. That example should be replicated many more times. That was a weakness of the development corporation in terms of helping to develop the industrial base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe. Our relationship with Sheffield city council and the development corporations is probably one of the best in the country. That partnership has developed. As my hon. Friend said, there was friction at the beginning, but we have worked through that and have made it work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was another area of great interest for a bystander studying the way in which the public and private sector actually operate: it is probably treading on some sensitive ground, but many will know that an inquiry took place in the lifetime of the development corporation and some serious allegations were made. I want to put it on the record that I do not believe that the allegations were true. I think that the people involved, particularly the chairman of the corporation, were extremely honourable, but it showed the conflict that can arise in the interface between the public and private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must stand back from that and ask whether it is in the best interest of UK Ltd. If we re-read the Garlick report to find out why that conflict arose, we see that it reveals the weakness of how we manage the public and private sectors. We have also seen that in part, in another way but with the same cultural problems, with the private finance initiative. Some basic principles are being played through in the private finance initiative that were played through in that inquiry. I think that people acted honourably, but there are lessons to be learned if a genuine partnership is to operate, as one sees on mainland Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
It is probably part of our adversarial system that a conflict exists between the public and private sectors, whereas the consensus politics in Europe probably mean that people tend to accept partnerships more readily than we do. It would be foolish if we did not learn lessons from those experiences. How to get the interface between the public and private sectors operating more efficiently and effectively is a cross-party issue and something we should examine. The development corporation is a good example of that and it was unfortunate that personalities became more important that the principle of the operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two hon. Members with Sheffield constituencies have expressed their thanks to Hugh Sykes and the board for what they have done. We can learn that it is sometimes necessary to focus on areas where action needs to be taken. I believe that the democratic process can be used a little better than it was used in this case, but the job has been done quite well. Now, we must look to the future and consider how to take the project forward without losing the momentum of the restructuring and the transport infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early 1980s, and through the lifetime of the development corporation, we considered how to diversify the industrial and economic base in a city such as Sheffield. We took two major steps down that road. The first was in relation to the cultural industries—that is working effectively—and the second was in sport. We did not build the facilities for the world student games, at a cost of £145 million, as an end in themselves; they were a means to an end. We did that to assist the development of Sheffield, obviously bringing in entertainment, but also as a real opportunity for Sheffield and the country to take advantage of the investment and know-how that we have in the city of Sheffield. We are making a bid for the British Academy of Sport. In itself, it will not create many jobs, but we believe that Sheffield's bid is important because it has brought about the partnership of the two universities, two hospitals, the local authority and what is called the City Trust—which I happen to chair—which runs the city's sports facilities. This is not just about the British Academy of Sport; it goes far wider than that. It is about assisting the universities to build a campus for 2,000 to 2,500 students, which will be the first academically led university of sport, covering all aspects of the subject. How do we then translate that knowledge into wealth creation, which is something we want in Sheffield? A spin-off from such a university will be the industries that supply sport and sports-related activities because the disposable income now being spent in that area is phenomenal, yet the majority of goods are imported. We are trying to create a manufacturing base out of that centre of excellence in the vicinity to translate that knowledge, technology and know-how into manufacturing. Sport is good in itself and for publicity, but it has to be translated into wealth creation. Our academy of sport bid has to be seen in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are tremendous opportunities now and we have to look to five or six years ahead, as we did in 1988 when we were considering the SDC. That was part of a process already in train, but it focused it and has done a good job. We would now like to make sure that we capitalise on the results. One of the things we do not do very well in the UK is capitalise on an investment once we have made it. There are areas now that we can look at with vision. Activities such as sport can be used for economic regeneration and can bring in major centres of excellence which can be wealth creators as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister comment on the need to have some sort of body that could take on the type of role that the SDC has had, for the wider city and for South Yorkshire? It is clear that even the Government accept that there needs to be intervention now that they have created Government regional offices. We have to look at how we can fit in the various parts of development and co-ordinate coherent thinking about them as we move forward in partnership for regeneration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I congratulate the development corporation, its board and staff for their work and achievements over the years. They had a specific task, were given the powers to get on with it and, of course, they had the money to make the achievement possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we try to weigh up to what extent the SDC can be given credit, it is important to recognise that many of the visible changes which have been achieved are due to civil engineering works—land clearance, the construction of new roads and the like. That is not the most difficult change to achieve if the resources are provided. The Sheffield development corporation will be judged in the long term in comparison with other development corporations and to what extent it has added value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any area which is seen as decaying, the real difficulty is attracting property development and private finance in the early days before a head of steam has been built up and the construction work has started to transform the area. The corporation and its board will be judged by the extent to which they were able to do that. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that they have performed well, certainly by comparison with some other corporations across the country. I would be sorry if their achievements were used in any way to denigrate the role of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I shall be sorry if the Government do not demonstrate confidence in the role of local authorities in future years by pointing out that it is not necessary in order to revitalise an area to have a body set up solely for that purpose whose chairman is appointed by a Government Minister. There are models across Europe and I hope the Minister, who has extensive local government experience, will recognise that. Given a specific task, ring-fenced funding, the requirement to involve the private sector and to ensure that every effort is made to attract private sector funding, it is perfectly possible for local authorities to perform the functions of the development corporation. Who can say whether they would have been as successful as the development corporation has been in this instance? Furture organisations should not simply go down the road of quangos—they must instead take the model of organisations that have democratic accountability and answer to local residents, as the development corporation did not have to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hallam, said, work remains to be done in Sheffield.

I recognise that one or two Opposition Members' memories are probably more convenient and rosy than accurate. It is intriguing to find that, suddenly, everybody is owning to the partnership idea. I must say that the hon. Member for North-West Durham (Ms Armstrong) is probably hanging on to the idea on the back of the dray by her fingernails. She is coming rather late to the scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a sour note, I am sorry that the hon. Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth (Mr. Davies) did not listen to some of the points made. One of those points concerned the involvement of the private sector and the ongoing effect of that involvement. The hon. Gentleman should recall that I pointed out that for every £1 of public money, £7 of private money was put in. Given the chances, the expertise, the planning opportunities, the regeneration to bring the land up to the correct state, the putting in of roads and the general infrastructure, the developers were there, ready to move in.

I am intrigued that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Central is also claiming credit—there is credit in all directions, but that is probably right. The corporation has brought success to the area. With a touch of nostalgia, we can all smile sweetly and take the positive side. The hon. Gentleman talked about the variety in
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the region as well as about jobs and the changes to industry. It is probably worth reminding him—although he is aware of the facts, of course—that a firm such as Avesta Engineering which produces stainless steel is part of the proof, in business terms, that we can do more and better for less. We produce as much, if not more, steel in Sheffield than at the industry's peak, but in better conditions: when the sun shines in Sheffield, it can be seen. Once upon a time, it could not be seen—people had to chew their way through the atmosphere. That has completely changed, but productivity persists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Central mentioned the inquiry and its lessons. We have learnt lessons from the whole system of development corporations and have continued beyond them. That should answer some of the points made by other hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not so long ago, local authorities were not willing to go straightforwardly into partnerships. They did not understand. They thought that they had to run everything themselves. That has changed, and we must accept that. Part of the change was the learning curve of which, perhaps, the inquiry was one aspect as was the Sheffield development corporation. We have continued the learning curve with the single regeneration budget and challenge funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked, as did others, about the future. The Sheffield development corporation had about £100 million of public money and £102 million is committed for the next seven years—but the commitment is to partnership schemes and to moving forward. The SRB challenge funds will have £91 million over the next seven years—£36.2 million in round two and £16.6 million in round three. If we reach round four, there will be further opportunities. I have already mentioned the capital challenge fund. Such developments will make the difference, but they are based on the learning curve brought about because of the Sheffield development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the prospect of a regeneration agency as part of the developments. I would welcome such an agency. I would listen to the current leader telling me about the agency and look forward to it. He has told me again and again. I hope that, with the help of hon. Members on both sides of the House with interests in Sheffield, we can encourage him and his colleagues to get it moving. The team of experts that developed the SDC must not be lost to regeneration. That opportunity must not be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe was generous. There were discussions—he said they lasted hours or days—but, ultimately, a deal came out of them. Because of that, the partnership was able to make progress, the SDC could go ahead and those dramatic changes were brought about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was interested to find out what would happen to the assets. Those that are not sold—almost all of them are—will be passed to English Partnerships and others. The airport was of particular interest: I understand that discussions have been held with Sheffield city council and, I am afraid, it is a case of "Watch this space."

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The hon. Gentleman made a dig about the cinema. I appreciate that cinema goers in Sheffield are having a bonanza. Equally, however, the council has recognised the benefits of that by giving planning permission for a leisure centre next door, and hopes to reap the advantages. I am sure that, with a quiet smile, the hon. Gentleman will recognise those benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of the SDC has been generally recognised by the Committee. There is no doubt that the corporation has done much to revive the local economy and improve Sheffield's image. It has achieved an enormous amount in extremely difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many new and exciting projects are under way throughout the city. Sheffield is now regarded as a place to be considered for developments. I hope that the opportunity that has been given by the SDC's cooperation will be picked up by the city council and
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
others, in partnership, and that progress will be made. The city has earned and deserves that chance and must grab the opportunity to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regeneration must continue. We must use new ideas and approaches and recognise that, even if we are clinging on to the back of the dray by our fingernails, regeneration is the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have rightly given considerable credit to the work of the corporation and all of the people on the board and in the team. It is time to wind it up and I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
