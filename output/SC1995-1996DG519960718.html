	<div class='legislation'>Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules (House of Commons Paper No. 329)</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Max Madden 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I regret delaying the Committee, but you may recall that yesterday the hon. Member for Liverpool, Mossley Hill (Mr. Alton) raised a point of order with Madam Speaker on whether this Committee should proceed, given that consideration of the Asylum and Immigration Bill has not yet been completed. In fact, the issue is due to be considered in the other place on Monday. Madam Speaker said that she would make inquiries and agreed that the points raised by the hon. Member for Mossley Hill were matters of substance, so I wonder whether Madam Speaker has communicated with the Clerk of the Committee or with you, Sir James, to say whether she believes that the Committee or should proceed at this time—the fag end of a parliamentary Session when relevant, although not directly linked legislation, is still being considered in the House and has not yet received Royal Assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Alton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Mossley Hill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. I support what the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden) has just said and want to link with it an associated point. There will be a need to have further Committees of this sort arising out of the legislation that is still before the House and which has still to be considered again in the other place. It strikes me that you, Sir James, may want to examine why it is necessary to have separate Committees which are very costly to establish the service and why we need to go through the same ritual again fairly soon when the present legislation has completed its stages. I believe that it would be far more efficient and cost effective if all the matters could be considered together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Miss Ann Widdecombe)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to those points of order, Sir James. The hon. Member for Bradford, West acknowledged—however obliquely—that there is no direct link between what we are considering this morning and the legislation that is proceeding through the House. This morning's measure flows from actions already approved by Parliament and resulting from European Union legislation, which must be put into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mossley Hill is correct in saying that there will have to be further rule changes
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
following the substantive legislation that is now being considered by the House, but it would be wrong to delay rules and changes that were laid before the House in April in order to deal with a matter that is not directly linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a message from Madam Speaker. She has considered the matter that was raised on a point of order in the House yesterday afternoon as to whether it is proper for a Standing Committee to proceed to consider the statement of changes in the immigration rules before the Asylum and Immigration Bill has completed its parliamentary career. It seems to Madam Speaker that there is no direct legal or procedural link between the immigration rules and the Bill. The rules have been drawn up and the proposals for change have been laid before the House, not in terms of the Asylum and Immigration Bill but under the Immigration Act 1971. It was therefore, following an established procedure that the House referred the rules to a Standing Committee were appointed the next day. Other kinds of connection between the Bill and the proposed changes to the rules, including issues of timing, are matters of argument and debate and will no doubt be raised in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is Madam Speaker's ruling, so I do not believe that there is a point of order for me to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Doug Henderson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules (House of Commons Paper No. 329).</p></blockquote>
I cannot help but note that the Minister seems to take particular pleasure in having Madam Speaker endorse her interpretation of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Mossley Hill. I wonder what is the reason for that pleasure. It would not be the first time this week that there had been a clash across the Floor of the Chamber of in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, was tempted to raise a point of order, Sir James, but I believed that it would expedite proceedings if I raised the matter now. I hope to demonstrate this morning that the Government have again performed a somersault over their making of regulations. They have been challenged in court on the regulations that flow from this statement and have given an undertaking that they will rewrite them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being asked today to consider related principles, but without the benefit of having the amended documents before us. That reinforces the point of order about timing raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West and the hon. Member for Mossley Hill, especially as many other matters arising from the Asylum and Immigration Bill will have to be resolved in delegated legislation. It surely would be better to consider all those changes together, particularly as we would then have the new regulations before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Central to those court proceedings were the application forms that the Home Office required to be completed within a tight deadline by those seeking variation of leave and to which the court objected. We should have sight of the redrafted application forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only a week to go before the parliamentary recess, an overspill beckons in October and a new Session starts in November. With the greatest respect, I do not see what is to be gained by rubber-stamping procedural changes, the central reason for which we have not seen. Surely it would be in the best interests of the Home Office, if it is not again to get egg on its face, that the Committee should see those forms before taking a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for reinforcing that point. He had a proud record of raising similar points during the Committee stage of the Asylum and Immigration Bill, whenever we were asked to consider matters without the benefit of documentation. I hope that that trend will not gather momentum during the Government's dying days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the best way for a Committee to consider matters. I do not mean to challenge the authority of the occupant of the Chair, Sir James; it is simply that I prefer to have sight of the documents before making a judgment on the rights and wrongs of a matter. The Minister will know that I do not disagree with the Government's documentation on every occasion. I am not always opposed to Government proposals to improve regulations. However, it is difficult to see whether the principles underlying the statement have any worth or validity if we do not have the regulations before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon.Friend the Member for Bradford, West said, the most controversial part of the statement of changes is in paragraph 2, which deals with applications for variation of leave. At present, an application need not be made in any particular form. All that is required is an oral or written request for variation of leave; other necessary documentation may be requested and supplied after the application has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of not applying before the expiry of existing leave are serious. The application may be dismissed on the grounds of breach of the Immigration Act 1971, and the right of appeal against refusal could be lost. Applicants also face the risk of prosecution for overstaying. I have not heard of any major problems from the various groups that represent persons who wish to make an application, nor have I heard the Government saying that those authorities faced any problems. In a sense, the change in the regulations has come out of the blue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of the statement of changes states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all applications for variation of leave to enter or remain must be made using the form prescribed … by the Secretary of State, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
must be completed in the manner required by the form and be accompanied by the documents and photographs specified in the form."</p></blockquote>
That change is to apply to all applications except those for asylum, those from European economic area nationals and those made to the Department for Education and Employment to extend work permits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change would mean that an application made other than on the prescribed form and other than in the manner required by the form or submitted without the accompanying documentation or information that is required by the form will not be considered as an application. Such an application will be in breach of the 1971 Act without a right of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's remarks closely. Does he agree that another central issue to which the court took objection was the requirements for a large array of original documents to be submitted? The requirement to submit documents that originated from overseas presents considerable difficulties for applicants in this country. Does he think that the Minister will make a statement this morning to the effect that the Home Office intends to relax those strict requirements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful to my hon. Friend. The Government have not expressed their intentions, but we may receive some enlightenment during today's proceedings—enlightened we await with anticipation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the closeness with which the hon. Member for Bradford, West has apparently followed the matter, I am surprise that he asked whether the Home Office has said that it intends to amend the list of documents. We gave clear undertakings in court about the changes that would be made to satisfy the court regarding the challenge that was brought against us. I shall reiterate the position when I make my substantive remarks in Committee but, given the apparent closeness with which the matter has been followed, I am surprised that the hon. Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) and for Bradford, West were not aware of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall mark down the Minister's intervention as an attempt at enlightenment, although I am not sure that it was successful. However, she may make a further attempt to clarify the position for the benefit of the Committee. I understand her concern. I know that she will be wary of her officials burdening her with additional paperwork, given the dynamism in the office to create paperwork. Given that he political philosophy is to reduce bureaucracy, I hope that she enlightens us in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time is limited, so I am happy to give way to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The idea is that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North opens the proceedings by making a statement, after which I call those members of the Committee who wish to take part in the debate. Those who wish to speak have only until midday to do so. time is getting on, so if the hon. Gentleman will continue to make his statement, I shall open up the debate and everyone will have an equal chance of being called to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. As the Minister of State partly addressed her comments to me, I must say that I understand that Ministers may believe that making statements in court is an adequate substitute for making statements in Parliament especially given the frequency with which they are forced to make statements in court. I hope, however, that the Minister understands that her predominant obligation is to make statements in Parliament, rather than in the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister was trying to be helpful. Perhaps we can now proceed in the proper way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your advice, Sir James, that I should be less generous in giving way to my colleagues and to the Minister. I will now try to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of objections to the proposed changes. First, can application rules be refined in this way, rather than by changes to immigration law? An application has been defined in immigration law in the case of Prajapati in 1982—case Imm AR 56—as a "clear and unambiguous request." Should not the amendments be made by legislation rather than by changing the rules, if the Committee's decisions are not to be subject to challenge in court? As we have already heard, the forms have already caused the Minister difficulty. Is it any wonder that the forms issued by the Home Office had to be withdrawn following that legal challenge?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The forms were not valid unless every specified document was included. In preparing the forms, the Government ignored the fact that not all documents required are always available. What if an applicant has had his passport stolen? What if a passport is being renewed at the embassy of the issuing country? What if a student cannot get a letter of authority from a college during the summer holidays? Would the Minister still consider the application not to be in order because the documentation was not complete at the time of application? Those are obvious questions, and I wonder what the Government's motivation is for introducing the regulations when they must know that such circumstances arise and must be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another objection is that some of the questions asked in the forms went well beyond the requirements of the immigration rules. To give a couple of examples,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the form to apply for leave to remain on the grounds of marriage required the partner already living here to show evidence that he or she had lived here for the past three years. However, the immigration rules say only that the spouse must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"present and settled in the UK on the same occasion being admitted for settlement"</p></blockquote>
—they specify no time period. The form for Commonwealth citizens applying to live here on the basis that one of their grandparents was born here asks for marriage certificates of the parents and grandparents. However, being born within marriage is not a condition of the immigration rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier—before I was over-generous in giving way—it would seem wise to have had the new forms before us so that we could consider them. If the forms are not available today, when will they be available? Can the Minister tell us what will be included in the revised forms? Can she confirm that applicants will not have to enclose all of the specified documents if they have a good reason for not doing so? If that is the case, what reasons will be acceptable? Have the questions to which I have referred—or any others—been withdrawn from the modified forms? Can she confirm that the changes will be in line with the immigration rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people will have no idea that the application forms exist and are required. The Minister will know that, currently, many applications are made direct to the Home Office, often without legal advice or assistance. If a letter requesting an extension is sent to the Home Office, why cannot the date of that letter be regarded as the date on which an application is made? Does the Minister accept that further consideration is needed on the matters that I have raised and those that I am sure my hon. Friend will raise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our opposition has been expressed to other points covered by the statement—I shall not go through them all, as that would be repetitious and our debate is time limited. However, I shall make some brief comments on paragraph 1 of the statement, which extends the definition of public funds in line with the social security regulations. It would bar those in this country on limited leave from eligibility for attendance allowance, severe disablement allowance, invalid care allowance, disability living allowance and disability working allowance. Until recently, people on limited leave were eligible for those benefits. Given the small numbers of people involved and the small amount of money that would be saved, I believe that reasonable and decent-minded people—such as those who opposed the Asylum and Immigration Bill—will regard the changes as petty and mean minded. I wonder whether the Government have the figures on how many people would have been affected by the proposed changes during the past 12 months or similar period. If the Minister can give those figures, it would help the Committee to put the statement in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

I have said more than I initially intended, so I shall just ask the basic questions. Why are we discussing the matter without the new rules before us? Given that we do not have the rules, what changes does the Minister propose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.52 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Miss Ann Widdecombe)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it would be helpful to the Committee to explain the purpose and effect of the changes in the immigration rules. I shall endeavour to answer the detailed matters raised during the debate at the end, if I am successful in catching your eye, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members with an interest in immigration matters will know that the cornerstone of United Kingdom law is the Immigration Act 1971, which came into force on 1 January 1973, and the immigration rules made under it. Those rules are rules of practice laid down for the guidance of those entrusted with the administration of the Act. They have been refined and developed over the years to reflect a variety of changes in circumstance and policy. The changes before us today reflect a number of such developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal at paragraph 1 of the rules change derives from the scrutiny on enforcement of immigration laws, which found that many people who were either here unlawfully or who had been admitted on the clear understanding that they would not have recourse to public funds were gaining access to publicly funded benefits and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 18 July 1995, the Home Secretary announced a programme of work agreed by the Government to implement recommendations made by the scrutiny. Those were designed to ensure that people who were here unlawfully or as visitors did not receive benefits to which they were not entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One important and effective way of achieving that is to make it a condition that those given limited leave to enter or remain do not have recourse to public funds. The list of public funds has been extended to include, as the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North said, those non-contributory benefits that are now linked to immigration status. The list will be further amended as other amounts and services are similarly linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of the rules change makes application forms compulsory—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the intervention of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North, will the Minister give us more detail about the number of people that those entitlement changes will affect? The hon. Gentleman asked about the number for the past 12 months, but how many people will be affected and how much will the measure save during the current period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can do so, I shall give the hon. Gentleman further information on that point later in the debate. If I cannot do so during the debate and if the information is available, I shall convey it to the hon. Gentleman in writing and send a copy to the rest of the Committee in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of the rules change makes application forms compulsory for certain immigration applications. Compulsory forms will mean a better service to applicants at a lower cost to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the old system, a clear request for an extension of stay constituted an application, but immigration applicants were often unsure about the information that they had to provide for their applications to be properly considered. Thus, we often received letters, such as those to which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North referred, which in effect said little more than, "I want to stay longer."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following such a letter, we would have to write to request further information. Often such requests would be for basic information such as full name and nationality, or even the purpose of the application. Self-evidently, that was inefficient and a source of delay. In the first quarter of 1997, we took 97 days on average to resolve non-asylum applications under that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, we announced our intention to move towards the introduction of compulsory application forms to try to solve the problem. There can be few other areas of public life where the use of an application form is not already a perfectly natural part of the process. So, last June, we commenced a 12-month trial of voluntary application forms, during which applicants showed themselves willing and able to use the forms. We received many more than 6,000 completed forms, and applicants generally completed them with great care. The trial showed that applications made on those forms could be resolved far quicker. On average, it took us only 45 days to resolve applications made on the voluntary forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for us to make further inquiries was greatly reduced by requesting the basic information that we needed on the form. Inquiries were made in only 26 per cent. of application form cases, often because documents were missing or the form was not fully completed, but we needed to make further inquiries in about 62 per cent. of non-application form cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilot scheme conclusively showed that the use of application forms benefited applicants, the administration of the immigration system and the taxpayer. However, all applicants must use the scheme to realise its full benefits, which means that it must be compulsory. Although the trial was extremely successful, fewer than 5 per cent. of applicants decided to use the forms in the voluntary pilot scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
During the voluntary trial, we engaged in consultation with a wide range of outside bodies, including the main immigration representatives, all United Kingdom universities and the Plain English Campaign. The forms were amended to take account of the comments received, many of which were favourable. For example, the Commission for Racial Equality said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The introduction of forms is clearly welcome."</p></blockquote>
The commission felt that the forms were user-friendly and as straightforward as was possible in the circumstances. The British Medical Association said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are a very useful and important development in the service you provide."</p></blockquote>
In contrast, the Immigration Law Practitioners Association did not welcome the forms and sought leave to mount a judicial review soon after they became compulsory—not during the consultation period. Although we consulted ILPA, its detailed concerns—unlike those of other bodies—were not made known to us until that late stage. In the light of points made, however, we suspended the forms and undertook to revise them in two respects. First—the issue raised by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North—the original forms required all relevant documents to be enclosed. We shall amend that requirement so that if there is a good reason why documents are not available—for example, a passport may have been stolen—the applicant can explain why and the application will still be valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, ILPA felt that on one or two questions the forms went beyond the strict requirements of the rules. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are carefully checking that no more information is requested than the rules demand. He asked me to give an undertaking that we would operate on the basis that the forms would reflect what was demanded by the rules, and we shall do so. Once those revisions are complete, we shall reintroduce them with a view to restarting the scheme, probably in September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short period before they were suspended, the forms proved to be extremely effective. In the public inquiry offices, applications were presented with all the requisite documentation and a fully completed form. Applicants did not seem to have difficulty with the new system. Applications were resolved more quickly and caller waiting times were reduced. The introduction of the forms will strengthen immigration control. Those who do not have a right to be in the United Kingdom will have their applications refused far more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept—and I make it transparent—that there will be a few applicants who leave matters to the last minute and then submit an invalid application. Those people risk losing any possible appeal rights if we refuse the subsequent valid application. We have
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
sought to minimise that risk by creating a document reception centre. Its sole function will be to decide the validity of purported applications—not the merits, but the validity. Any invalid applications will be returned quickly to the applicants with information that will help them to make a valid application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, despite all that, an application is received after leave has expired, it will still be considered in the usual way and many such applications will be granted. It should be noted that in 1995 the after entry and appeals directorate refused only about 8 per cent. of the applications that it received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although some may lose appeal rights, that is far outweighed by the benefits to the great majority from the introduction of compulsory forms. As it was a matter of debate on the unrelated Bill, I should point out that compulsory forms will have an effect on unscrupulous immigration advisers. I do not pretend that the forms will be a complete answer to that problem, but they will help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such forms are easy to use and state what is required. If applicants need help to fill them in, the forms point out that they can contact our telephone inquiry bureau. Applicants are required to sign the form, which means that we know that the application has been made with their knowledge and consent. Many thousands of applicants under the old system chose not to employ a representative. Forms make the system simpler and easier for all applicants and should reduce the need for them to seek help. Compulsory forms will also help solicitors who are not experienced in immigration law, who were mentioned by the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) during the unrelated Asylum and Immigration Bill debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the introduction of compulsory application forms will result in a better service to applicants and better value to the taxpayer. We will tighten control and there will be less scope for abuse of applicants by unscrupulous and exploitative immigration advisers. Clearly, it is right that we should go down the road that is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the other changes. The change at paragraph 3 provides that applications for further leave to remain from sponsored students should normally be refused if their sponsor does not consent. That serves to protect the interests of overseas Governments and international organisations which sponsor students in the UK on the understanding that they will return to their own country at the end of the course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final major change before us is the replacement of the appendix indicating the nationals or citizens of countries who require a visa to come to the UK. The expanded list reflects changes brought about by the introduction of the European Union common visa list. Article 100c of the treaty on European Union required the Council to adopt a list of third countries whose nationals require visas to cross the external borders of the member states. The regulation was published in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>

	<i>Official Journal</i> of the European Community in October last year and we took the opportunity of this rules change to bring that into effect on 4 April 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial proposal from the Commission contained a list of 126 countries. While I admit that there are still a number of countries from whom we would not otherwise have sought to require visas, the United Kingdom was successful in reducing the figure to 101. The result is that 14 countries needed to be added to the UK's current visa requirements. Two other countries on the common visa list—Tanzania and Gambia—have already been made subject to our visa requirements in advance of these changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we have made some small, technical amendments. For example, there is a technical change deleting Liechtenstein from the list of countries whose nationals may qualify as au pairs because Liechtenstein signed the European economic area agreement in May last year, enabling its nationals to benefit from free movement and employment rights. Another minor amendment concerns EC association agreements with central and south-east European countries so that there are now four more countries—Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia—whose nationals benefit from those agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are sensible and practical amendments which, for all the reasons I have mentioned, enhance the effectiveness of the Government's immigration policy. They tidy up loose ends resulting from policy and practice changes and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Max Madden 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the Committee is proceeding in the absence of documents that I believe are essential for proper parliamentary scrutiny and consideration of the measure. I especially regret that the redrafted application forms are not available to the Committee. I also note, if I can have the Minister's attention, that she did not refer to a matter that I raised on a point of order—the requirement for original documents, which poses a real problem. I hope that when she concludes her remarks she will tell us whether the Home Office will relax that requirement for original documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to three matters, the first of which is the visa requirements for the United Kingdom. There are a number of countries whose nationals require visas to enter this country. I refer first to Iran and a report that appeared in
	<i>The Guardian</i>on Tuesday, written by Jonathan Steele. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under secret Home Office guidelines, which the Guardian has seen, any Iranian who gets out of Tehran airport legally is deemed not to have a case for asylum."</p></blockquote>
I fully understand that today we are dealing not with asylum but with visa requirements, but I would appreciate the Minister's comments about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
existence of such guidance. I accept that she will be unable to give a categoric reply now, but I hope that she will reply to a parliamentary question that I have tabled and give a clear assurance about such a document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say with absolute clarity and non-ambiguity that we are obliged to consider every application for asylum on its merits. There is no way that we could deem a whole group of people as having no claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance and hope that it can be expanded in the reply to my parliamentary question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns the inclusion in the list of nationals of China. The Minister of State will remember that yesterday I raised a point of order with Madam Speaker. The Minister implied during the proceedings of the Asylum and Immigration Bill on Monday that Chinese women who were victims of forcible abortion, sterilisation or genital mutilation—or were fearful of such torture—could apply for asylum in the UK by going to the British embassy in Peking. She said that the merits of their claims would be considered. My understanding for many years has been that the long-standing Foreign Office policy is to refuse asylum applications made overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister's statement was extremely misleading and that it influenced a number of hon. Members in their voting on Monday. My concern is that, so long as those misleading ministerial statements remain on the record uncorrected, the voting intentions of the Members of another place, who will consider the legislation on Monday, could be similarly affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. First, I seek your guidance on whether my point is a point of order, as I do not want to do anything spurious. The clear implication of the hon. Gentleman's remarks is that a Minister has misled the House and that I am that Minister. Would it be appropriate for me to respond on a point of order, or should I respond through an intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would much rather that the Minister refuted all the unfair allegations when she winds up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave notice of my point of order to the Minister's office yesterday and I am grateful to the Minister for giving me a copy of her letter to Madam Speaker. I hope that she will forgive me if I quote only part of the letter—she may want to expand on it. The last paragraph states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have checked thoroughly the Hansard record and have taken official advice. I have no reason to believe that anything I have said on this point needs correcting."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
It is my clear understanding—and I have consulted a number of right hon. and hon. Members since Monday—that Foreign Office policy is that no British embassy or high commission can receive or record an application for asylum, and that still less can that application be considered on its merits or, indeed, at all. I shall not read out the statement, but Committee members can find it at column 823–4 of Monday's 
	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the definition of public funds. Again, I fully understand that we are dealing specifically with non-settlement cases, but I draw to the attention of Home Office Ministers the inequity that will remain so long as family credit is deemed to be a public fund, particularly in relation to settlement applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer briefly to my constituent, Sodagar Hussain. She and her husband, who have two children, have been separated for more than 11 years. He has made several applications to join her in the United Kingdom, and there have been several appeals against the refusal to grant him a visa. The only reason advanced for refusing to uphold the appeals was that, during the 11 long years in which she has been separated from her husband and her children have been separated from their father, she had sometimes been in receipt of family credit. As a low-paid worker, her income had at no time during the 11 years reached more than£100 a week. Had her husband stayed here when he married her as a visitor rather than, on my advice, returning to Pakistan so as to keep strictly within the immigration rules—rules that still apply—he would undoubtedly have been given permission to remain and would not have endured the misery that he and his wife and children have suffered during those 11 long years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised that matter in countless letters, parliamentary questions and, most recently, in an Adjournment debate that was answered by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope). During those exchanges, it became clear that it is Home Office policy not to regard family credit as an overwhelming reason to refuse admission to the United Kingdom, provided that couples can show their ability to be self-supporting in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the Home Office is unwilling to define the long term. It is clearly longer than 12 months, because people coming into the UK have to reside here for 12 months before they can apply for indefinite leave to remain. I assume that it is about two years. In my view, appeal adjudicators are in desperate need of clear guidance on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an insignificant matter: 10 per cent. of women in full-time employment in my part of the country earn less than£100 a week. The brutal reality is that British citizens—men or women—who wish to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
live with a partner in marriage in this country have no prospect whatever of achieving that aspiration if they are unemployed or earning less than£150 a week, and unless they have adequate accommodation—adequate that is, in the view of the immigration service and the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not pursue the matter further, except to say that I would appreciate hearing the Home Office view on my latest representations in the particular case to which I referred. If all else fails, I hope that the Home Office will be willing to give Mr. Sodagar's latest appeal priority, so that the matter can yet again be put before the appellant authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Alton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Mossley Hill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because of the constraints on our time. In any event, the issue has been exhaustively covered by the hon. Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, North and for Bradford, West. However, I wish to explore one or two matters further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that if there is an absence of documents or if a person's leave to remain expires before the application form is submitted, it will not necessarily invalidate an appeal. I welcome that assurance. She may wish to clarify it further. My understanding of what she said is that if a passport or other document did not accompany a form, or if someone simply did not know that an application form had to be completed and the time to remain in the country had expired, it would not, of itself, necessarily invalidate the appeal. Is the Minister going to respond?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a note of that point and answer later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help if the Minister could answer now. If my understanding is correct, I shall not need to pursue my case further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said clearly—indeed, I said that I wished to make it transparent—that if an application form submitted at the last minute is invalid—not unmeritorious but invalid—and therefore has to be resubmitted, and if the valid application arrives after leave has expired, that person loses appeal rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious matter. How many people are likely to be caught in that lacuna?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if only one person is caught and loses the right to appeal, we should think seriously before introducing the new system. I have no objection to the idea of an application form. It would be absurd to argue that an application form in itself is a denial of civil liberties. However, if the procedure will remove a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
person's right to appeal—even in a small number of cases—we must think seriously before agreeing to its implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said nothing about a widespread public information campaign. Its absence will mean that people will not know that the procedures have changed and, through no fault of their own, will lose their right to appeal and presumably will be excluded from the country in due course. That issue must be explored further and I hope that the Minister will outline to the Committee the number of people who will be affected. She said that the number would be small, but can she put a figure on it? What will be the fate of those who did not lodge an appeal simply because they did not know that the rules had changed and that application forms were required?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was at some pains to say that the measure is not related to the Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is still proceeding through Parliament. However, her speech made it pretty clear that the measures are intricately related, not least in respect of unscrupulous immigration advisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have missed my statement that Madam Speaker does not think that there is any relation between the two subjects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept Madam Speaker's ruling, but when we debated that piece of unrelated legislation in Committee the Minister said that unscrupulous advisers were the central question. Furthermore, a member of that Committee tabled an amendment about that matter and it was raised again on Report. I welcome today's announcement inasmuch as the changes will tackle some aspects of the unscrupulous advice given by those who want to exploit people and inasmuch as they will speed up procedures. During discussions on the unrelated Bill, a point was made about the time that it takes to deal with immigration and asylum applications. Obviously, we want more efficient procedures in place—there is not difference between the Minister and myself on that point. If what she said about the time that will be saved by the forms is right, that is justification for their use and one with which I would not quarrel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to appeals. Rules cannot redefine the law, but the Minister seems to be doing that today. Given the ruling in the Prajapati case to which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North referred, we are flying in the face of a decision taken in the court and redefining the law through changes in the rules. I hope that the Minister sought prior advice from a Law Officer, because there are clear legal implications in what is being proposed. Will she say whether a Law Officer has given advice to the Home Office on that aspect of the law?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also say whether the law still stands whereby a clear and unambiguous request
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
constitutes an immigration application? If it does not, will she confirm that changing the rules has changed the law? If so, they will be open to challenge in the courts. The Minister said that various agencies were consulted. She admitted that some of them, albeit after the consultation period had technically expired—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were other groups. For example, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants also took a contrary view and objected forcefully to the potential loss of appeal and other matters. Surely parliamentarians also have the right to be consulted on such matters. Is not it slightly bizarre that we have not had a sight of any of the forms that were used during the consultation period and during the voluntary exercise that the Minister described? They have not been laid on the Table before us today. Why, then, have the Government introduced firmed-up proposals for a compulsory scheme without giving us copies of either the voluntary forms or the forms that will be used in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Voluntary forms are in the Library; they have been there for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, but no one wrote in advance to members of the Committee to tell them that the forms were in the Library. Without the benefit of extrasensory perception, members of the Committee cannot be expected to know that forms have been lodged in the Library. It would have been courteous of the Minister to have provided the Committee with those forms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Faulds 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not this a typical example of a Home Office ploy to make all such operations as difficult as it can for all parties concerned? It is absolutely typical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. It is a nightmare trying to find our way through the minefield of regulations and technical changes made by the Government. That means that we cannot properly do our job, which is to scrutinise legislation, to act on behalf of our constituents and to ensure proper accountability. We must have basic documents—such as forms that we are being asked to approve—laid before the Committee. Incidentally, in her intervention, the Minister was referring not to the new forms, but to the forms that were used in the voluntary exercise. She has said today that the new forms will not be the same as the voluntary forms, so going to the Library to look at the voluntary forms appears to be a total waste of time because they are not the forms that we are being asked to agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason that I referred to the voluntary forms—as the Committee will have heard—is that those were the forms about which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
hon. Gentleman was then talking. He said that the voluntary forms had not been laid before the Committee; I pointed out that they were in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I then went on to say—as the Minister will see when she reads the record of our proceedings—that I was not referring only to the voluntary forms. I made the point that the new forms are based on the voluntary forms but that changes have been made. We do not know what the changes are, and the new forms have not been laid before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not been given any information about the number of people who will be affected. When I asked the Minister about that in an intervention, she said that if the information could be provided today, we should be given it during the course of our proceedings, and that otherwise she would write to us subsequently. Although that will be of interest, it would have been far more useful if the information had been issued to the Committee before we were asked to make a decision. We are being asked to remove the entitlement of a limited number of people to attendance allowance and basic levels of benefit that may be a lifeline for them. I would like to know how many people will be affected. That information should have been issued to the Committee before we were asked to make a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that time is short and I saw you, Sir James, looking anxiously at your watch, so I shall conclude. I support the remarks that the hon. Member for Bradford, West made on the Floor of the House yesterday and in Committee today on the subject of Chinese women. We had a substantial debate on that matter on Monday, so I shall not reiterate the arguments now. However, there is still a lack of clarification, and I hope that in her reply the Minister will spell out precisely what is the situation of the women to whom the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having missed the beginning of the sitting. Due to the tube workers' action—which, of course, I entirely support—it took me a long time to get to the House of Commons this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No Opposition member of the Committee has any objection in principle to the form, but it is wrong that we are being asked to agree changes to the rules that are contingent on a form which we have not seen. There is a history in immigration legislation of the rules being used, in effect, to change the law. We are not able properly to judge the effect of those rules unless we can see the form. That is poor practice—the type of poor practice that leads to the Government appearing in court time and again. It is an abuse of parliamentary procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
As I said, there is no objection in principle to the form, but I am concerned that the technicalities of obtaining and filling in the form will result in people in effect losing their appeal rights. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that matter. I would also like her to shed some light on why it has proved impossible to have a copy of the proposed form before the Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to the effect on public funds, I am concerned that people who have an unforeseen illness while here might, through no fault of their own, be unable to receive the help that they need. It seems unnecessarily cruel and uncivilised that such people should be deprived of help and support. The Minister may have touched on that point before I arrived in Committee, but I should be interested to hear what she has to say about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all, Sir James. I was just ensuring that all members of the Committee had had their say, otherwise I should have been accused of trying to railroad the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of interesting points have been raised. First, I shall deal with the comments made by the hon. Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden), especially those that he made about yesterday's points of order on an unrelated Bill in which he suggested that I had misled the House. I have sent the hon. Gentleman a copy of the letter that I wrote to Madam Speaker, in which I acknowledged his courtesy in giving me notice of his point of order. As I said in that letter, I have carefully reviewed what I said in
	<i>Hansard</i>and taken all due advice, and there is nothing that I want to correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it may be helpful if I explain—with your indulgence, Sir James, as I am unsure whether this is strictly to do with the business before the Committee—what would happen to a person who made an application for asylum at one of our embassies. The entry clearance officer would consider the merits of the case, and he could do one of two things: he could say that the case was the grounds not for an asylum application but for another form of application or for no application at all; or he could say that the case was extremely pressing and that it appeared to be grounds for asylum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The entry clearance officer would not then grant asylum—I never said that he would—but he could, having considered the merits of the case and ties with the United Kingdom, issue a visa so that the person could come to this country specifically to claim asylum; or he could refer the matter to the asylum
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
division for advice. The asylum division would then say either that the case was not merited or that it would like to consider the case further so the person should be issued with a visa to come to the United Kingdom to make an application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate, I said not that the embassy would make the final determination of asylum but that—I stand by this and hope that I have explained it—the embassy would consider the merits of the case, ties with the United Kingdom and any other matter that arose under entry clearance considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister has made an extremely significant statement. I am sure that at least three parliamentary colleagues who were members of the Committee considering the Asylum and Immigration Bill could confirm my recollection that at no stage of those proceedings were we made aware of the fact that asylum applications could be made at British embassies or high commissions in the way that the Minister has just described. Indeed, the whole burden of those proceedings was that the emphasis was on those seeking asylum making applications at the port of entry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had been told that there was a facility to lodge applications from overseas, we would have wanted to consider that extremely carefully. Therefore, I hope that the significant statement that the Minister has made will be drawn to the attention of the House and the other place before the legislation receives Royal Assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Bradford, West has misled himself. There is nothing new in what I said. I was very clear. The embassy will not determine the application, but the embassy has always been able to issue a visa to people to come to the UK. They must be in this country before their application for asylum can be granted. That has not changed. When I go abroad and talk to staff at entry clearance posts, one of the questions that I ask is, "Do you get many requests for asylum?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has got very excited about nothing. All I have stated is the current practice. Asylum will not be granted abroad, but there is nothing on earth to stop someone applying abroad and being further advised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Faulds</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should not we consider the advisability of informing embassy staff that they have that right? I travelled abroad a great deal when I was younger, but I still occasionally visit foreign parts. I have never heard the matter raised in an embassy discussion as a right of the staff there. As the Minister is rather reluctant to let us know what is going on, may I suggest that she should overcome that reluctance and let embassy staff know that they have that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is the second hon. Gentleman who is misleading himself. I cannot believe the depths of misunderstanding about what I have just said, which was nothing new.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has nothing to do with the rules before us. I enjoy the odd digression, and the Chairman has been extremely indulgent, but I want to return to a discussion of the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. My remarks are relevant to the rules. The Minister will recall that she has just said that it is possible for a British official at an overseas post to grant a visa enabling a person to come to the UK and apply for asylum. If such a person applied for asylum as a visitor, the application would instantly be turned down, on the ground that the applicant was not a genuine visitor but was seeking settlement in the UK. I read scores of notices to that effect issued by British overseas posts every day of every week of every year. I therefore return to my initial point: the Minister's statement is extremely significant and should be brought into the public domain on a rather larger scale than in committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Faulds</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any embassy staff informed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must return to the matter before us. I am particularly anxious to hear the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North at the end of the debate. The report of the Committee will read very well, but we are not dealing with the substance. May we return to it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most willingly, Sir James. I confirm, as I want to put it on the record, that I have just received further legal advice stating that everything that I said is correct. That includes the statement that there is nothing new in what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the matter before the Committee. I was asked—I think by the hon. Member for Newcastle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
upon Tyne, North, or perhaps by the hon. Member for Mossley Hill—about the requirement for original documents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Widdecombe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. He suggested that the requirement was new. It is not new. We have always required original documents; we continue to require original documents; we have no intention of departing from that requirement. That may not be what the hon. Gentleman wants to hear, but I hope that it clarifies our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mossley Hill asked about those who would lose appeal rights. I stated clearly in my opening comments that even if an application is received after leave has expired, it will still be considered in the usual way and many such applications will still be granted. I said that in 1995—which predates the new procedures that I have announced—the after entry and appeals directorate refused only about 8 per cent. of the applications that it considered; 92 per cent. were perfectly all right. I also described the steps that we had taken to minimise the possibility of someone who had previously made an invalid application then making a valid application that missed the deadline. I referred to the document reception centre, the sole function of which is to check that application are valid—properly filled out and with the necessary documentation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Bradford, West, but I shall not respond on the details of the case he mentioned. First, I do not believe that the Committee is the right forum in which to make my response. Secondly, I do not have the details before me, as the case is being handled by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope). I shall, however, undertake to have the matter looked at further. If I then have a response, I shall inform the hon. Gentleman; I hope that that is helpful to him. I think that he will acknowledge that he has never yet asked to see me and been refused or raised a matter with me that has been ignored; the case that he has raised will likewise not be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questions asked by Opposition Members were, for the most part, answered properly and fully in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
clear explanation that I gave the Committee. I believe that, overwhelmingly, the case is made. There will be a saving to the taxpayer, greater ease for applicants, a greater deterrent for unscrupulous immigration advisers, and faster administration. There has been a general welcome for the forms from many interested organisations. The other issues we are considering have excited little comment, so I believe that the Committee is generally content, and I once again commend the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.41 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to press the question to a Division for two reasons. First, the social security regulations endorsed by the statement are mean and, even following our debate, unquantified. It is wrong for us to endorse such a controversial change without knowing the scale of involvement. My second objection relates to what happened a number of times in the Committee that considered the Asylum and Immigration Bill, when we were asked to agree to proposals that we did not have before us. Parliamentary scrutiny is yet again being flouted by the Government. On a controversial matter that has already been challenged in court—the Government had to withdraw the original documents—they ask us to approve the introduction of compulsory forms when we do not know what the contents will be. That is unacceptable, and there are strong grounds for rejecting this statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
