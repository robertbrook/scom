	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Is it in order for the Committee to proceed with consideration of regulations that appear to be in contradiction of the European convention on human rights? As you know, we have enacted the convention into British law, and it applies to primary legislation, regulations and the courts. In the process of developing the regulations, the Government were asked whether they would allow some channel of appeal; they did not. Lord Lestor QC and other counsel have given the opinion that article 6(1) of the European convention provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a speech, but he is not entitled to do so on a point of order. Will he come to point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of order is this: if the regulations do not provide for an independent and impartial tribunal to be established by law to consider the cases to which they give rise, other aspects of the regulations will affect the civil rights of manufacturers and the right to property. Are we, therefore, justified in considering them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a serious point. As I understand it, he is hinting that there is a conflict between the regulations and human rights legislation. I must tell him that human rights legislation does not apply to secondary legislation, which does not have to be compatible with the European convention on human rights. There is, therefore, no reason whatever for the Committee not to proceed as planned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the convenience of hon. Members, they may remove their jackets if they want to do so. I invite any hon. Member on either side of the Committee who has an interest to declare to do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether this is necessarily a declaration of interest, but I want to place on the record the fact that my brother is the chief medical officer and head of regulatory medicine for Glaxo Wellcome. I do not normally take any part in matters that relate to pharmaceuticals in the Department. Those are normally dealt with by my noble Friend Baroness Hayman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>4.32 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Medicines (Advertising and Monitoring of Advertising) Amendment Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 267).</p></blockquote>
This debate is about the passing of unaccountable power to an unelected body, the transfer of responsibilities from the judicial to the Executive arm of government, and the lack of natural justice that flows from that transfer. As the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)—who is no longer in his place—suggested in his point of order, there is great concern about whether the regulations comply with the European convention on human rights. I heard your ruling on that matter, Mr. Gale. In the responses that I have seen from the Government to date there has been no suggestion that they do not care whether the regulations comply with the European convention on human rights. In fact, the Government have categorically said that their advice is that the regulations do comply with it. The industry has the benefit of learned opinion to the effect that the regulations do not comply with the requirements of the European convention on human rights in so far as they do not provide access to an independent judicial tribunal to consider the decisions of the Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Medicines Control Agency, acting in the name of Ministers, is being given the power to be police, prosecutor, judge and jury in its own case. That is the principal area of concern to which I wish to draw the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I begin by recounting the brief history behind the amendment regulations. In 1992, the European Union issued directive 92/28/EEC on the control of the advertising of medicines. In 1994, two sets of regulations were made by the United Kingdom Government to give effect to that directive. Between 1994 and 1997, those regulations were operative. As I shall seek to show, they worked very well, providing a satisfactory framework in which the industry and the consumer functioned without any problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1997, the Medicines Control Agency apparently managed to persuade incoming Ministers in the new Government of the need for further powers—the need to gold plate the requirements of the European Union directive. Regulations were issued in draft form in late 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why were those regulations needed? That is the big question—the missing piece of the jigsaw. Is there any real explanation why the Medicines Control Agency required those additional powers? Between 1994 and 1997 there have, as far as I am aware, been no examples of serious problems arising from the operation of the present regulations—or perhaps I should refer to them as the previous regulations, these amendments having already come into force on 5 April. The Medicines Control Agency, which has the power under the previously enforced regulations to initiate prosecutions or seek injunctions, has never, in the three years in question and, indeed, in the five years to date, found it necessary to take such legal action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
We will be asking why it was necessary for the Government to introduce an additional raft of regulations in the United Kingdom. Perhaps the answer lies in Europe. The Minister will no doubt be able to give us a clue when she responds to the debate. Perhaps the European Commission complained that the regulations, although working well, were not sufficiently draconian in the United Kingdom. However, that is an unlikely explanation, considering the regimes that operate in other European countries, and the way in which they work. So why must we gold plate the EU directive by introducing further regulations in a way which will not, on the evidence before us, offer any benefit to consumers but will be wholly detrimental to our pharmaceutical industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various issues are raised by the amendment regulations, and I shall touch on a couple of minor ones towards the end of my speech. The major concern is with the regime for pre-approval of advertising material, and the introduction of a ciminal offence into the arrangements for dealing with any breaches of that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be helpful if I outlined how the pre-amendment system worked. The Medicines Control Agency had the right to request sight of any advertising material that a company intended to introduce before its publication. If, having had sight of that draft, the Medicines Control Agency expressed concern over the text of the material, the company would then be invited to respond to the MCA's concerns. In the vast majority of cases, the matter would be resolved at that level by informal negotiations and discussions between the company concerned and the MCA. If it was not possible to resolve it at that level, the MCA had the power either to refer the matter to self-regulation within an industry-wide agreed mechanism, or to initiate court proceedings. I understand—I am happy to be corrected if the Minister for Public Health has other information—that since the regulations were introduced in 1994, the MCA has never once found it necessary to initiate court proceedings to ensure proper compliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft amendment regulations were produced in late 1997 and put out for consultation by the Government. I understand that to date, no regulatory impact assessment has been produced; if it has, I have not seen it. In accordance with the remit of the better regulation unit, a regulatory impact assessment should have been produced when the draft amendment regulations were put out for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was universal condemnation of the draft amendment regulations from the pharmaceutical industry. In response to that, the Government did not instigate further discussions with the industry; they simply laid the regulations on 5 February 1999. As amended, the regulations make some fundamental changes to the regime. I should like to give an outline of that revised regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment regulations effectively create the new criminal offence of disagreeing with or ignoring an MCA determination on the legality of an advertisement. Before a final determination is made,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
and regardless of the advertisement's legality, a notice can be given to withdraw it. That notice could remain in force until a final determination is made. There is no right of appeal for a company receiving such a notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, before a decision is made on whether an advertisement is legal, withdrawal can be ordered by Executive action. There is no provision for compensation if it is subsequently found through judicial or administrative processes that the advertisement in question is fully compliant and should not have been ordered to be withdrawn. Industry could bear immense costs as a result of the withdrawal of material under compulsion, but, even where it is subsequently found that that action was wrongly ordered, there will be no compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the previous law, only the courts could decide on the legality or otherwise of an advertisement. The MCA was the prosecuting authority with the power to apply for an injunction to the courts, but it was in the same position as any other prosecuting authority—if it believed that an advertisement was in breach of the law, it would have had to convince the courts of its case. The amendments graft on to that system provisions allowing the MCA to make determinations before the courts become involved, so that an advertiser could be judged guilty by the MCA: the gamekeeper becomes the judge. The decision is being transferred from the judicial branch to the executive branch. Although companies can make a case in writing to the MCA while it formulates its determination, once that determination is made they have no right of appeal to the courts, to an independent appeal tribunal, to another quasi-judicial body or to any other body that would fulfil the requirements of the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A company can involve the judiciary in testing MCA decisions by recourse to only two extreme courses of action. On the one hand, it could ignore the MCA's direction, blatantly commit an offence and taunt and dare the MCA to prosecute it. On the other, it could seek to initiate a judicial review of the MCA's actions. The latter is a complex and costly legal procedure, and having recourse to it would mean using a sledgehammer to crack something that problems with existing legislation have not even proved to be a nut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fundamental lack of adherence to the principles of natural justice, including the right to a hearing before an accuser, to be heard in front of an independent tribunal and to have legal representation at such a hearing, underlies the Opposition's major objection to the regulations. I would not be present in the Committee if a huge body of evidence demonstrated massive abuse of existing procedures and a huge need to strengthen the law to protect the consumer. The MCA has never had occasion to use the powers it has under other legislation, but the regulations vest yet more powers in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations as enacted exceed the provisions of the Medicines Act 1968, and are an extraordinary interpretation of the requirements of the original directive. They do not provide recourse to independent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
review or a route to appeal, and do not require the MCA to publish its findings so as to establish transparency, to demonstrate consistency in its proceedings and to allow the industry to predict its likely response to future advertising strategies. To put it bluntly, the whole thing stinks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What have the Government told us about that? Why does the MCA claim that it needs additional powers? We have to consider an unconvincing and messy case. I shall not bore the Committee by speaking at length about the various controversial cases that have arisen since 1994, but I shall cite one example. In 1996, a well-established topical product, which was licensed for self medication to treat arthritic pain and which had been on the market for more than 20 years, began to be advertised to the public as a treatment of mild to moderate arthritic pain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MCA registered an objection. It began by claiming that the product was not licensed for the condition. When that stance failed, the MCA complained that arthritis was a condition for which advertising was not allowed, even though the regulations were silent on that point. It told the company in question that it required to give pre-approval on all advertising for the product, but later admitted to the company in writing that it had no power to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MCA then directly contacted independent television companies, advising them to pull the advertising off the air. The broadcasting advertising clearance centre had already approved the advertising, so the ITV companies rightly refused. The MCA then asked the Independent Television Commission to intervene, but it refused to do so because its legal advisers considered the advertising to be legal. During the course of the events, no consumer laid a complaint about the advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MCA—and one must give it credit for persistence, at least—attempted to have the law changed by statutory instrument in order to prevent advertisements for treatments of arthritic conditions. It sought to create the situation that it had originally claimed existed. That proposal went out to consultation. In response, the British Medical Association Arthritis Care and other concerned organisations indicated strong support for the advertising of that product and for such remedies for arthritis in general. The upshot was that the regulations, far from banning advertising for arthritis care products, now allow advertising for common over-the-counter products for arthritic conditions. That process took almost a year and, needless to say, cost the company in question a great deal of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for greater regulation is not proven. There is no evidence of a need for greater powers. The industry was concerned that, if the current regulations had been in force at the time of the case that I have just cited, an offence would have been committed as soon as the company failed to comply with the MCA's original interpretation of the law. If the MCA had told the company that it had changed its interpretation of
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the regulations and that the company's advertising required pre-clearance, refusal by the company to accept that ruling would have, in itself, constituted an offence. The company would have had no route of appeal, other than seeking judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked for the debate because we were concerned that there seemed to be a gap between what was happening in reality and what ministerial statements suggested was happening. We wonder how things work in the Department of Health. Do Ministers really understand the concerns expressed by the industry and by consumer organisations about the regulations? Have the soothing replies that hon. Members have received from Ministers been drafted by the MCA itself? We implicitly criticise the judgments and decisions of that body by posing such questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A principal purpose of the debate is to ensure that the Minister hears at first hand the arguments that others put, without the possibility of any filter being imposed by the MCA between the Minister and I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure introduces criminal offences, with the possibility of imprisonment, to an area that has hitherto operated well under a consensual system. It replaces consensus with confrontation. One example speaks louder than 1,000 words of Government rhetoric. The Government tell us regularly about their emphasis on collaboration and co-operation as the way to take the health agenda forward. Here we see an example in which effective collaboration and cooperation between industry and a regulator is being swept away by a regime that requires confrontation for justice to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MCA, which acts for Ministers, is required to make a decision on the basis of fact—would a given advertisement breach the advertising regulations? If those regulations are not sufficiently clear and precise that that is indeed a question of fact, I suggest to the Minister that the Government should turn their attention to that aspect of regulation rather than to changing the pre-approval procedures and introducing new offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are introducing an extraordinary process for which there is no need—the previous arrangements were perfectly adequate. However, if Ministers did not like the previous arrangements they could have introduced an alternative regime that—to use a phrase that you and I have heard quite a bit over the past day or two, Mr. Gale—went with the grain of the way in which things are done in this country. They could have introduced a clear definition of what is and what is not acceptable and a clear offence of publishing something that falls outside that definition, leaving it for the courts to decide on the facts, when the MCA brought a prosecution against an offender, whether the advertisement concerned had stepped outside the limits prescribed by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another, even odder, thing is that the MCA itself has admitted that the reason why it seeks this extension of its power is that in the cases that have been controversial over the past five years—those where the MCA has not initiated legal proceedings—it has not initiated those proceedings because it did not believe that it would win them. I submit to the Committee that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

assessing one's chances of winning a case as nil is not a good ground for changing the law. To convince me of that, it would first be necessary to adduce the damage that is being done to some relevant interest or a threat that is being posed to consumers by actions that were unchallengeable within the scope of the existing regulations. In all the relevant correspondence, I have not seen a convincing, coherent argument that the public interest requires this substantial extension of the regulatory regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the universal condemnation of the publication on 5 February of the draft regulations, the Government made just one, very modest, concession. On 15 March, they slipped in to a parliamentary answer in the House of Lords the information that they intended to set up an independent review panel to advise the Medicines Control Agency where an advertiser submitted evidence to the agency disagreeing with its notice that it is minded to disallow a certain piece of advertising. The heart leapt for a moment. Unfortunately, however, that independent review panel is an internal mechanism of the MCA. It does not have any binding force. It will be advisory only, and does not in any sense meet the requirements of the European convention on human rights for an independent judicial tribunal to deal with matters of this kind.

In this country we have a world-beating pharmaceutical industry. It is one of the few British manufacturing industries that can genuinely claim to have grown in stature on the world stage over the past 20 to 25 years. The pharmaceutical industry is an international industry, so the perception of an oppressive and highly damaging regime being brought to bear will reign not only in boardrooms in the United Kingdom, but in boardrooms in Japan and the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, the Government have handled the matter badly. We must ask why. Who wants the new regime? Why introduce it? Why has it been considered necessary to introduce this draconian extension of Executive power in an area that—I emphasise again—was working perfectly well?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask myself that question in the context of a wider question about the MCA. Not long ago, the Minister and I faced each other across the Dispatch Box in an Adjournment debate on another document—MLX 249—that also dramatically extended the powers and remit of the MCA. There may be a read across. The agency's traditional role is to some extent being usurped by developments in Europe. As we move towards a pan-European system of medicines approval, it may be realistic to consider a reducing role for the national medicines control bodies in each member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Medicines Control Agency is not thrashing around looking for reasons for its existence, or at least for the continuance of its existing size and strength, and trying to carve a niche for itself. How poetical it is that, just as Europe takes power away from it by moving ever closer to pan-European systems of medicines approval, so Europe might provide the answer to the MCA's problem, by
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
allowing ever more rigorous intepretations of European directives to be enacted in United Kingdom law through ever tighter regulations transferring ever more power from the judicial to the Executive branch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I witnessed something rather similar happening in Germany—if I may indulge in a small anecdote, Mr. Gale—when I used to travel there regularly. Germany signed the Shengen agreement, which reduced border controls. I remember thinking, "I wonder what will happen to all these uniformed Grenzschutzpolizei—the border protection policemen who used to check one's passport—once 50 per cent. of the travellers entering Germany no longer required their documents to be checked. Rather naively, I assumed that they would add to the then rapidly mounting tally of unemployment in Germany. In fact, the number of border protection police did not change at all. They found it absolutely necessary to redouble their diligence in checking the documents of the 50 per cent. of travellers entering the country who still needed their documents checked following the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps ungenerously, I am moved to wonder whether there is not an element of make work in the agenda that the MCA appears to be proposing to Ministers. We are being asked to accept the abandonment of a tried and tested self-regulatory system—one that the MCA has never had to test by recourse to the courts—in favour of a confrontational system for which there is no need. That antagonises the industry; it will be enormously costly; and, in the opinion of learned counsel, it is in breach of the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister needs to get political control over her Department, or it will run her ragged. This matter, and the associated matter of MLX 249, on which she also had reassuring things to say, once we were able to move the debate to the political level, show all the signs of the Department's bureaucracy having got control of the agenda. I hope that the Minister will ensure that she and her colleagues get a grip on the situation and that such incidents do not recur. This has done neither the Government nor the industry any good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instrument should be annulled by the Government or they should at least introduce proper independent, quasi-judicial appeal tribunal procedures. That would give those who are aggrieved with the administrative decisions of the MCA ready access, through a defined route, to a proper appeal tribunal, with a further route to the courts if necessary after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ideally, I should like the instrument to be withdrawn and industry and the Government to sit down together and discuss the matter. Together, they should deal with any real defects that the Government can identify in the previous system, rather than grafting on new, unnecessary and unjust powers to be exercised by an unelected and unaccountable body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Interestingly, that company is one of the few that have not corresponded with me on this issue, although many other companies and individuals have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to keep my comments brief because I should like to give the Minister ample opportunity to respond and I agree with almost everything that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said. I suspect that we received similar briefing materials and met the same people to discuss our concerns about the legislation. Certainly, I support his call for the withdrawal of the instrument, or at least for the establishment of an adequate mechanism to afford the rights of appeal that are due according to natural justice, which may arguably be due to comply with the European convention on human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking personally, I have always been concerned about the need for careful and proper advertising of medicinal products. I suppose that, as a doctor, I take a somewhat paternalistic view, but we need to protect potentially vulnerable consumers from misleading advertising messages. I always look sceptically at adverts that I see outside the professional press. Consumers who are seeking relief of symptoms or a cure should be considered as especially vulnerable compared with those people who are considering a choice of consumer goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have an interest to ensure that there is not a disaster as a result of the inappropriate use of pharmacologically active materials because those products are in a different category to many others that are advertised. We must also bear in mind the protection of consumer choice. That should not be the first priority of Health Ministers, but hon. Members should bear it in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the protection of free speech, so that the controls on misleading advertising do not take the sledgehammer-and-nut approach and restrict free speech for every little, if any, gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a need to protect the rights of companies so that, when faced with regulation, they may trade in a climate of adequate and fair appeals mechanisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those needs must be balanced. My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) and I believe that the correct judgment has not been made and the correct balance has not been achieved. There are existing mechanisms and the need for further legislation has not been proven by the record of the current regulations. Even if there were breaches that required the Medicines Control Agency to initiate court proceedings under the former arrangements, which pertained before 5 April, one could still argue that the legislation will go too far. However, because that has not been demonstrated and given that a new
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
criminal offence will be introduced that is punishable by fine or imprisonment, there needs to be a high threshold before action is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of proportionality. With good reason, I have been more cautious than some of my hon. Friends in criticising the Government for nanny-statism. However, although I have tried hard to see the matter from the Minister's perspective, I find it difficult to defend the impression created by the Government that they are granting more powers to the MCA in a proportionate way. In fact, the MCA is being allowed to take on more powers—draconian powers—than the problem, if it exists, requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I caution the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, against falling into the trap of bashing the MCA. It is answerable to the Government and responsibility for its actions, particularly those that translate into regulations, lies firmly with the Government. Indeed, in the interesting 1994 case that the hon. Gentleman recounted, the onus was on the Government to ensure that the MCA acted according to regulations. I was delighted by what seemed to be the hon. Gentleman's conversion to the cause of the European convention on human rights and its incorporation into our law. For a moment, I thought that he was about to support the Schengen agreement as well, but he did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that the Minister will accept that there is at least an argument—which was put by Lord Lester QC in his role as a barrister—that the regulations will breach the European convention on human rights. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the advice that the Department has received and make it available in the Library. Despite your judgment, Mr. Gale, that we are not obliged to consider the European convention on human rights when debating secondary legislation, in considering such matters in the light of the Human Rights Act 1998, we should be entitled to interpret such advice in cases where action is taken by individuals in the British system—let alone the European system—in respect of a potential breach of the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members will have received a letter from the Under-Secretary of State, Baroness Hayman, explaining the Government's position. I hope that I shall not steal the Minister's thunder if I briefly analyse her defence of the Government's position. In the light of the view that was expressed that the legislation is too draconian, the Government have set up an independent review panel. However, the industry has judged the panel's definition of the protection of the rights of advertisers to be inadequate, and has questioned whether it will act as fairly as would a tribunal or the English courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Hayman's letter states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the MCA has a statutory duty to act on behalf of Health Ministers in controlling the advertising of medicines."</p></blockquote>
I do not doubt that, but is that statutory duty to act the same as a statutory duty to make a decision that is unappealable? Many agencies that act on behalf of the Government involve an independent tribunal. The Benefits Agency springs to mind, and Committee members will be pleased to hear that the much-maligned Child Support Agency has an independent appeals mechanism that goes through the courts. Should Committee members encourage constituents to seek a judicial review of an agency's decision, and should the statutory duty to act incorporate a statutory duty to make decisions that are unappealable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Hayman's letter goes on to say that the MCA
	<br><blockquote><p>"cannot, therefore, concede to industry the right to an independent decision on whether a particular advertisement is in breach of the medicines legislation."</p></blockquote>
As regards freedom to trade, free speech and consumer choice, should the British courts, which constitute an important avenue of complaint, be closed to trading companies? The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the independent review panel acts only for the MCA. It is a creature of the MCA because it advises the MCA. The Government could apply the label "independent" to any person or body and hope that it was appropriate. They use labels such as "new", "people's" and "modernise" in the same way to make a point that should be proven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Hayman's letter continues: "The Licensing Authority"—that is, the MCA—
	<br><blockquote><p>"retains the right to take enforcement action through civil (injunctive) action or by prosecution as a criminal offence under regulation 23 of the Advertising Regulations for an appropriate breach of those regulations".</p></blockquote>
The proposals do not make it clear whether a criminal offence has already occurred—the advertisers may have refused to withdraw an advertisement—or whether the courts still have to reach a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should reflect on the fact that judicial review involves significant costs and delay and that many products are advertised on a seasonal basis. If no compensation is available for the judgments that the MCA takes, with the best possible motives, but which are found to be erroneous, it will be hard for small companies in particular to exercise their right to trade. Could the regulations be improved to better balance the necessary interests that need to be protected?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have this opportunity to put the record straight in relation to the regulations. The speeches of Committee members contribute to the misunderstanding that has surrounded much of the debate about the regulations outside the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have two aims: to protect public health and the interests of the consumer. It was suggested that the regulations were unanimously opposed, but that is not the case. They were positively supported by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and by all of the medical royal colleges, and we did not receive objections to them from patient groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise the extent to which consumers increasingly expect better information about medicines and want to take more responsibility for their own health. It is important to avoid statutory regulation when self-regulation is an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With new media and communication techniques, it is even more important to ensure that information provided to consumers is reliable and sound. The 1992 European directive on advertising gives Health Ministers clear responsibility to ensure that advertising is not misleading. Self-regulation is permitted within the terms of the directive, but if it is ineffective, Ministers must fulfil their obligation under Community law to ensure that the terms of the directive are implemented. The 1994 regulations implemented the directive and the current amending regulations increase their effectiveness by clearing up areas of misunderstanding that have arisen since 1994 and underpin the self-regulatory system, where necessary, with regulatory action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee whether the Government have had an indication from the European Commission or any external body that the 1994 regulations do not effectively implement the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have not had an indication that the directive is not being implemented, but we are concerned that it does not have sufficient means within existing regulations to ensure that it is properly implemented. The hon. Gentleman will not need to be reminded that the Commission sets the framework of European law and it is for member states to implement that law to deliver those objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom approach relies principally on self-regulation and much of the time that works well, but there are clear examples of self-regulation being insufficient and that makes the case for robust regulatory back-up to allow Ministers to protect the rights and interests of consumers. A small minority of companies have acted in ways that put public safety and consumer interests at risk and could undermine wider public confidence in other information about medicines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Misleading advertising about any product is undesirable, but medicines have the power to do considerable harm to vulnerable individuals if used inappropriately. Misleading advertising can lead to unnecessary consumption of medicine and no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
medicine is risk free. If the public are influenced to take unsuitable medicines, they are exposed to unnecessary risk while receiving no benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge described a product that was advertised as being effective for arthritis, but it was not licensed for that at the time of advertising and no data relating to its efficacy and safety had been submitted to the MCA. The company withdrew the advertisement, amended it and the licence was subsequently varied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another product, which was licensed for relief from rheumatic pain, muscular aches, pains and swelling, was advertised as being unsuitable for sciatica. One concerned and disappointed purchaser wrote to the licensing authority stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that you are able to take some action to prevent sufferers from the very painful complaint of sciatica having their hopes raised and wasting their money and time on this product. Whilst I can afford the wasted money there will be many other older and poorer people who cannot."</p></blockquote>
Both those advertising campaigns had been approved by the self-regulatory body. It is indefensible for any company to advertise medicines as treating medical conditions for which the medicine has not been properly authorised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like to hark back to our debate on dietary supplements, but it will not be sufficient for the Minister to show that unnecessary consumption might be stimulated; she will have to show that serious damage might be done.

	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon.

There must be a regulatory system—whether self-regulatory or statutory—to ensure that consumers are properly protected in such cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to make some progress. I shall deal with breaches of the regulation. It is not the case that the regulations have existed without being breached. In 1997–98, there were 78 breaches and last year, 1998–99, there were 135.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1997, Ministers in the Department of Health had concerns because pharmacists and other health professionals were being offered inducements to prescribe or supply certain products. Once Ministers had made it clear that that practice was illegal and unacceptable, the focus of promotions simply shifted to other members of the primary health care team, such as pharmacy assistants, practice nurses and doctors' receptionists. The public rely on the advice that they receive from all members of the health care team. They have a right to expect that such advice is reliable and unbiased and that staff, in offering such
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
advice, could not have been influenced by the chance to win a holiday weekend, a cordless telephone or a watch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A small section of the industry is failing to recognise the responsibility to protect public health by the control of advertising. There is a wilful refusal to accept the law as it stands. For example, one company whose advertising was in breach of the rules wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe the MCA have no powers to pre-vet nor to request pre-approval changes to advertising of over the counter medicines … this advertising has been successfully approved by the pre-vetting authority, the Proprietary Association of Great Britain."</p></blockquote>
Frankly, that is wrong. Powers exist in the directive and they have been enhanced by the amending regulations before the House. Where there is a misleading advertisement, the public want speedy action, not prolonged wrangling about roles and responsibilities. The case of the misleading advertisement for sciatica took several months to resolve. How many more consumers purchased the product in that time and delayed seeking the medical advice that they needed while relying on the claims made by the company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make some progress; I will be happy to take interventions in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to the amending regulations. I want to make it absolutely clear that any member of the health care team who is in a position to recommend or suggest treatments should not at any point be influenced by inducements. We want to ensure that all advertising should be consistent with the condition for which the product has been licensed. That is the bedrock of our system of licensing medicines, which is the envy of many other countries. We also want to underline clearly the powers of Health Ministers as the responsible authority in line with the EC directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to respond to the industry's three main criticisms of the regulations. Those criticisms are that the powers are excessive—as the two spokesmen for the Conservative and the Liberal Democrat parties said—that the MCA is expanding its role and that the regulations reflect a lack of fairness and openness. I reiterate that the regulations are supported by professional bodies and by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the powers excessive? We believe that it is normal and reasonable, where a body with specific expertise has been appointed, for that body to take decisions on behalf of Ministers, subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts. In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) about the European convention on human rights, Ministers have taken legal advice on the matter. That advice is not in agreement with that of Lord Lester, for whom I have enormous admiration, and the Government have been assured that the regulations are compatible with the European convention on human rights and with Community law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I shall come to the provisions that will be extended by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we have powers to achieve rapid and effective action to protect public health. The power to require quick withdrawal or to request sight of advertising before it is issued has been reflected in UK legislation for many years. The MCA will continue to exercise that role, which will remain largely the same, with care and discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pre-vetting of advertising is undertaken only in exceptional circumstances, for instance, where a prescription only medicine becomes an over-the-counter medicine. Ministers must give their reasons for doing so in every case and the grounds are clearly defined in the guidelines for industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the arguments about fairness and openness. We listened closely to the consultation responses and announced our intention to establish an independent review panel, which will confirm our commitment to independence, clarity and transparency. The regulations will provide companies with the right to make written representations before a final decision is made. A panel of three independent people, who will be selected for their legal, professional and lay expertise, will consult industry and a wide range of professional and consumer organisations on membership. In law, Ministers must retain responsibility for taking the final decision. That is an important aspect of the accountability of the licensing process, about which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge appeared to be unware. In doing so, Ministers will pay scrupulous attention to the recommendations of the review panel. If they decide that—to meet the overriding obligation to ensure compliance with the law—they cannot accept the recommendations of the panel in a particular case, they will state their reasons. The operation of the review mechanism will be transparent and consideration will be given to publication of decisions. A right to make representations in writing will exist and the independent review mechanism will deal with whether advertising and promotional material may be in breach of the regulations. I reiterate that judicial review will be available at every stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have been approved by the better regulation unit. In response to the hon. Gentleman's point, it was also clear that a regulatory impact assessment was not required. The regulatory framework already offers companies wide scope to use
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
innovative and creative forms of advertising and nothing in the regulations will impair that development.

There have been some clear examples of a minority of companies breaching the legislation. Self-regulation has therefore not achieved the desired result. It has not offered the degree of protection that the public expect. The regulations confirm the essential power to protect the public from misleading advertising and, in so doing, protect public health. Self-regulation will continue to be the expectation, but where it is clear that advertising poses a risk to public health because of claims that are not supported by the terms of the licence, additional safeguards will be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

First, I should dissociate myself from remarks made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in one of his interventions. He misunderstood the different issues arising from the regulations for vitamin supplements and those for the products under discussion. In the case of such pharmacologically active products, it is hard to show that there would not be a risk of an adverse effect as a result of consumption. If that consumption is not necessary, or the drugs are taken for the wrong condition, the likelihood is that there will be an effect. In the case of vitamin supplements, it is argued by those who are concerned about overdose or inappropriate use that such use is a matter of choice because they are not pharmacologically active in such high doses. The argument of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is not the right one with which to counter the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was not convinced by the Minister's defence of the regulations, although the Liberal Democrats do not dispute the fact that it is wrong for products to be promoted through inducements to staff, other than to doctors. That guidance should be extended to other practice staff, who may well give advice to patients. I am sure that all Committee members want pharmacists to have a wider role in that context. However, it is unsatisfactory to defend all of the regulations by reference to a non-contentious proposal. It may be necessary to amend the regulations. In particular, we need to consider the process carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the Minister said that the European Union had not stated that directive 92/28/EC had not been properly implemented. In the absence of an appropriate hint from the European authorities, there is, other things being equal—in this context, the other things may be negative—no justification for the Government to act. What is called the gold-plating of EC directives is not a proportionate or reasonable response to an arrangement that has not been criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should avoid the difficulties that are associated with the use of anecdote. I advise colleagues in my party to avoid seeking to prove points, especially in scientific contexts, by anecdote. However, the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman and the Minister exchanged anecdotes. They are equally culpable in that respect. I am not sure what we should read into the arthritis anecdote that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge gave. The facts of that case seemed to be disputed by the Minister. Likewise, the Minister stated, anecdotally, that a company had said that it thought that the MCA could not pre-vet advertisements, and she said that it was wrong to say that. She went on to say that the MCA can insist on pre-vetting only in exceptional circumstances, such as when a drug that was available by prescription becomes available over the counter. To be told, anedotally, that one company was not clear about the law relating to exceptional circumstances does not mean that all of the regulations should be agreed to, especially those relating to the associated process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister said that during the past year there had been 135 breaches of regulations and she implied that that made a case for the change in the process. It does nothing of the kind. Her suggestion is a red herring. The question is not whether there have been breaches of the regulations—if there were never any breaches, one might ask why have regulations at all—but whether those breaches have been adequately handled under the current arrangements. It would appear from the published data covering the number of times that the MCA has initiated court proceedings that all 135 cases have been satisfactorily handled. That is clearly not, therefore, a justification for the proposed changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the significance of that figure, 135? If it represented 135 cases out of 135,000 advertisements, would that be a high or low rate? No European comparitors are used for breaches in existing mechanisms. Does the Minister accept that if, under the new regulations, 270 breaches were handled by the new method, which we do not support, that would be a reason for reverting to the original system? Of course not, because the question is not simply the number of breaches, but whether they are satisfactorily handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If more draconian measures are introduced, a problem might arise if the less scrupulous players in the industry—to whom the Minister referred en passant—where to make unscrupulous allegations against other advertisements. Under the new regulations, that could lead the MCA to stop those advertisements from appearing, thereby creating a competitive advantage. That possibility must be borne in mind, even though it may not be the Government's responsibility under the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations should not be changed unless there are good reasons for doing so. The present mechanism is not broken and the Government should resist their urge to fix everything in sight. The proposals go much too far in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the Minister, I should like to put on record that I did not dispute that the original European Union directive allows the Government to introduce the pre-vetting of advertising. I deliberately did not deal with that question. I questioned the wisdom of the United Kingdom Government gold-plating all the regulatory regimes that they introduce to give effect to EU directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that a question of proportionality is involved. One of the pharmaceutical companies commented that the damage that the measure would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
cause to relationships between the MCA and the industry and to the confidence of the industry in the United Kingdom, would be out of all proportion to the supposed mischief that it seeks to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I said in my opening remarks—I stand to be corrected when I have read 
	<i>Hansard</i>—that the draft measure was universally condemned by the industry. That is what I intended to say. Other bodies that have not been involved in the same way might take a different view. The Minister said that no body in the EU, or any other qualified body, has claimed that the 1994 regulations are inadequate to implement the EU directive. The regulations in this country were, in their previous form, broadly in line with those of other European countries, but are noticeably more draconian in their present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister failed to produce any evidence of problems needing to be addressed. As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, there is a temptation to believe that the Government have an agenda for fixing things, whether or not they are broken. That is like a bureaucratic routine in which everything has to be replaced every five years, or in which cars that have only done 3,000 miles are thrown away or changed because they happen to be five years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to cases that I quoted, as well as to some others. She then asked, rhetorically, how many other people had been affected by those measures. She posed the question, but did not answer it. The Government tell us about evidence-based medicine. The Minister has not produced any evidence or quantified the problem, but is introducing a draconian framework to deal with it. If there is a problem and people are being put at genuine risk of harm—not just at risk of wasted expenditure because they choose to be guided by advertising—the Minister must bring that evidence to the Committee and convince us that there is a case to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is introducing an additional raft of regulations and referred to the new regime underpinning self-regulation. I wondered if I had misread the statutory instrument, so I read it again. I do not understand how the new regime underpins self-regulation. Where is the self-regulatory element in the scheme? It seems to extend the unilateral power of an executive agency of government. That goes to the heart of the question of whether the European convention on human rights is complied with. I confess to being incompetent to engage in the detail of that legal argument, except to note that we now have three learned opinions available to the Committee: that of Lord Lester, that of the Government's anonymous counsel and that of the hon. and learned Member for Medway (Mr. Marshall-Andrews). I do not want to become involved with the Minister in a slanging match about "My QC is more eminent than yours", but I do not know what quality of advice the Government have received. I am always surprised, perhaps naively, when eminent lawyers come up with diametrically opposed views on a matter that seems straightforward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. Compliance with the ECHR is the icing on the cake and our argument is independent of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there were 78 breaches of the regulations last year and 135 this year, but she did not say why there have been no prosecutions. As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, if there were so many breaches and the Medicines Control Agency did not find it necessary to take legal action in any of them, that suggests not that the regime needs revising, but that self-regulation is working well and functioning as it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been persuaded by the Minister's arguments, with the single exception that she has sown a doubt in my mind about the European convention on human rights issue, which is not central to the argument.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Gale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional power that the Government are seeking in the regulations is to strengthen the present system which, in our view, does not offer the public sufficient protection. I reiterate the importance of the cases about which the MCA has expressed concern, many of which have taken an inordinate time to settle. The case of the arthritis advertisement, to which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred, took up to one year to resolve. In the meantime, the advertisements continued and people continued to take a medicine that failed to benefit their condition in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very least, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is inconsistent in regretting the fact that we are not responding to the demands of Brussels. The conclusions that were reached about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
inadequate public protection that the existing, purely self-regulatory system provides were reached by the Government. We intend that that system will continue as the principal means of managing the controversy about advertisements but, where the need arises, it will be underpinned by an increased statutory power. For the provision to work, it must have stakeholder support, and I have placed on record the support of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the royal colleges. We are not trying to gold plate a directive. As I said, we are continuing the self-regulatory regime, but strengthening it to ensure that the public are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made about the Government's legal advice, I can say that I am prepared to consider it. As I understand it, there is a difference of view and lawyers become extremely rich through their skill in creating such differences. I am sure that many lawyers, including the lawyer to whom I am married, will not be offended by that remark. However, the critical issue is whether, as the Government's legal advisers made clear, judicial review is adequate to meet the requirements of article 6.
