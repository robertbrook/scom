<br><br><!-- lb --> HEALTH SERVICE TRUST TO NOTIFY PARENT ETC.</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 788, in page 91, line 41, leave out subsection (3) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3) The health authority or trust shall inform the parent of the named person or any voluntary organisation that is likely to be able to give the parent advice or assistance in connection with any special educational needs that the child may have.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment has been discussed at some length with the Special Education Consortium and the Spastics Society. It is relevant to the earlier debate about local authorities, and I hope that a few brief remarks will be sufficient to obtain a clear statement of the Government's view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that a health authority or national health service trust provided the name of a person or voluntary organisation whose services would be available to the parents of a child who is likely to be statemented. The parents would then be able to obtain advice from a voluntary organisation which, because of its involvement with children of special needs, would be well qualified to give it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When parents are faced by the statementing process they have little idea of what is involved. The practical support offered by the voluntary sector should be used to a greater extent. The efforts of everyone involved would probably be more successful if statutory and voluntary organisations worked together and with the parents. As soon as the parents are put in the picture about what help and advice is available, the statementing process can be undertaken without too many hitches. Unfortunately, hitches often occur in the current statementing process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the time, but not always, the health authority, through its contacts with the child, is the first to become aware that a third child may need special educational help to overcome his difficulties. The Education Act 1981 contains some general provisions about that process, but practice shows that they are not fully effective. In this short revisit to the 1981 Act, we should take the opportunity to reinforce those provisions to ensure that health authorities give parents information about voluntary organisations, which can help them during the statementing process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the local authority is also involved the current arrangements will be improved and that will help to initiate inter-agency co-operation between it and the health authority or trust and useful information sharing. That will ensure that the statementing process, instead of being a nightmare, as it is too often, will be undertaken with co-operation, knowledge and understanding by parents who will benefit from receiving help from voluntary organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those cases in which there is, I am sure, universal acceptance of the principles, as outlined by the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). I cannot imagine any dispute among members of the Committee about the desirability of maximum co-operation between all those involved in the process of identifying a child's special needs. More particularly, I cannot imagine that there will be a difference of opinion over the relative roles to be played by the different authorities involved—in this case, mainly district health authorities or trusts, where appropriate, working, it is to be hoped, in harmony with local education authorities and schools, as relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference that might arise would be about the desirability of taking that further step for which the hon. Gentleman has been arguing, from the 1981 Act, which he has said may not be working satisfactorily in some cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that the Act may not be working satisfactorily in some cases. I think that the Minister could be presented with hundreds of cases in which it is most definitely not working satisfactorily. The amendment would put current good practice into statutory effect so that there would be a duty on everyone involved to do their best, in place of a reliance on an authority's intention to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. I was not aware of the problem—in fact I would not express it in those terms—but I accept that it may well exist. That brings me to the effect of the wording and the question of whether it is right and sensible to remove from the Bill the key subsection that contains the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the health authority or trust are of the opinion that a particular voluntary organisation is likely to be able to give the parent advice or assistance".</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether the wording of the amendment would make that much difference. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The health authority or trust shall inform the parent of the named person or any voluntary organisation that is likely to be able to give the parent advice".</p></blockquote>
That wording gives a judgmental element to the directions to the authority and may leave us pretty much where we started. If I were someone in an authority or trust I could, I suppose, say in a certain case that I did not think any organisations were likely to be able to help the parents, and that therefore there was no need to give them that advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I am being over pernickety. I am simply saying that the form of words in the amendment might not create the effect intended by Opposition Members. I do not want to make that my reason for telling the Committee that, on balance, I do not think the amendment should be accepted. I say that in passing, but it is an important consideration because if I liked the idea I could suggest that the hon. Member for Bridgend should redraft the amendment with the proper words. I do not think that I like the idea sufficiently to do that, because I believe that a combination of the contents of the Bill and such guidance as my Department gives from time to time—on which we may need to elaborate—works. If the hon. Gentleman has evidence of cases where that is not so, I should like him to send it to me so that I can judge whether there is anything else that I or the Department can do, even before the Bill becomes law. I do not see why we should wait for the legislation before we can get matters moving or put them right. If we can do anything now, I want us to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
do so. As the wording in the Bill generally reflects the provisions of the 1981 Act, it is possible that I should be able to do something about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a finely balanced issue. However, I am not persuaded that the hon. Gentleman's suggested approach is justified or necessary. It may not have the effect that he wishes. Having reflected on the amendment, I recommend that the Committee does not accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. On balance, I think that it was sympathetic. He seemed to say that if I can produce case histories to show that it would have helped for such advice to be an automatic provision, he would consider either doing something under existing legislation or making a suitable amendment to the Bill. In the knowledge that the Minister is prepared to act on evidence, I beg to ask leave to withraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 819, in page 91, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4) Where the Tribunal has ordered a local authority to maintain a statement which includes non-educational provision, the local education authority may request the health authority to assist in maintaining the statement, and the health authority shall—

	<ol>

	<li>agree to assist in maintaining the statement, or</li>

	<li>inform the child's parents in writing why they are unable to assist in maintaining the statement.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I shall be brief. The amendment would ensure the provision of the resources to meet the needs tabulated in the child's statement, in this instance with respect to non-educational provision. We ask that the health authority should agree
	<br><blockquote><p>"to assist in maintaining the statement"</p></blockquote>
—in other words, it should provide the resources needed. If it feels that it cannot do so—that should not be the case—it should "inform the child's parents" of why it is unable to meet those needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say that once a need has been prescribed in the statement it is the duty of the LEA, the social services department or, in this instance, the health authority or trust to meet it. With those few words, I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, this is a continuation of a debate in earlier sittings. It covers the vital issue of the allocation of responsibilities across LEAs, district health authorities and others involved in meeting the requirements set out in a statement. I do not want to re-run the arguments about parts III and V of a statement, which were reasonably aired in our previous sitting. I should, however, set out the reasons why I shall suggest that the amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall soon discuss tribunals and I cannot wait—mainly because my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education will deal with them. However, suppose that a tribunal decision is involved. The tribunal has no direct jurisdiction over non-educational provision—that which will be provided for in part V.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through his amendment, the hon. Gentleman appears to seek assurance that non-educational provision specified on a statement will be delivered and that, if not, the parents should be given a clear explanation by the health authority. However, I do not believe that is necessary.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1156</span>
First, a parent might consider that a provision specified in the statement as non-educational should be specified as an educational one. If so, the parent can appeal to the tribunal, under the terms that we shall soon discuss. If the tribunal agrees, it can then amend the statement. The provision would then appear in part III and the LEA would become responsible for delivering it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a parent might be aggrieved that the education authority is failing to deliver the provisions in part III of the statement. If so, the parent has a right under the Education Act 1944 to complain to the Secretary of State who can issue a direction to the LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the parent might be aggrieved that the provision in part V—the non-educational part of the statement—is not being delivered. In that case, the parent should take the complaint directly to the health authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 11 of the patients charter provides the right
	<br><blockquote><p>"To have any complaint about NHS services—whoever provides them—investigated and to receive a full and prompt written reply from the chief executive or general manager. From 1 April 1992, health authorities and NHS hospitals will have to publish details regularly of both the number of complaints received and how long it has taken to deal with them."</p></blockquote>
It continues—and this is important:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you are still unhappy with the way your complaint about the administration of an NHS service has been handled, you have the right to take the matter up with the Health Service Commissioner."</p></blockquote>
Page 19 tells people what to do if they think that they are being denied one of the national charter rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, a mechanism for redress exists, whose stages I have tried to trace. Through the tribunal process, the education provisions in the Education Act 1944 and elsewhere, and the patients charter, which would be activated for part V of the statement, the satisfactory delivery of the different elements specified in the statement can be ensured and redress sought. The amendment would not add materially to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment goes slightly further than it intends? It implies that if there is a non-educational element in the tribunal's decision on the statement, the education authority could request the health authority to share the cost of the whole statement. There would be nothing to stop the education authority shifting some of the costs of the whole statement onto the health authority. That would cause many problems of interpretation and parental rights would become muddied, whereas, as my hon. Friend the Minister suggests, the position is comparatively clear as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that even my officials spotted that part of the amendment—I shall talk to them about that later. The amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the local education authority may request the health authority to assist in maintaining the statement, and the health authority shall—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1) agree to assist in maintaining the statement."</p></blockquote>
The reference is not to the appropriate part of the statement or to part V, but to "the statement".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not be drawn into agreeing that if that is the only problem with the amendment, we could simply alter it. The amendment illustrates the difficulty of trying to be too specific. We are in danger of repeating an earlier debate, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) for raising the point because it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1157</span>
strengthensmy reservations about the amendment. We have already sufficient mechanisms for parents to seek redress if they believe that the needs identified in the statement are not being met. Even though the services provided may range across the LEA and the health authority, or other bodies, the provision is adequate. Such matters are finely judged, but on balance, I urge the Committee not to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion the Minister has cleared up satisfactorily some points. We were worried about the health authority or trust being able to provide the assistance referred to in the statement. The hon. Member for Battersea has gone a little over the top in interpreting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an apology to make, which I make willingly, to my officials. They have just handed me a piece of my brief which clearly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is more, the amendment does not specify that the health authority's assistance should be in relation to the non-educational provision only."</p></blockquote>
As ever, my colleagues in the Department had spotted the relevant details and informed me of them. The failing was mine for not having read the brief. In apologising to my colleagues, I point out to the hon. Member for Bridgend that they, too, felt that there was the same weakness in the amendment as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not as though that snippet of information will alter what I shall say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It clears my conscience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I allowed the Minister to intervene. I guessed that an apology would be forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would have to comment on the minds of lawyers in order to widen the interpretation of the clause when the intention relates to non-educational provision. In discussing how a parent can take up the issue of provision from the national health service through the patients charter, the Minister dealt with this point satisfactorily. Voluntary organisations and others will make it clear to parents of children with special needs how they should deal with problems of non-educational provision. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONSTITUTION OF TRIBUNAL</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 350, in page 92, line 2, after 'tribunal', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'members of which must have recent experience and knowledge of special educational needs'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendment: No. 640, in page 92, line 18, after 'State', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and shall include members who have expertise in special educational needs and who have experience in local government.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to give statutory force to the consultation paper released by the Department for Education in July. In it the Department recognised the need for members of tribunals to include those with expertise. The paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regional tribunals would be drawn from a panel of legally qualified chairmen, and from a panel of members,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1158</span>
some of whom would have experience and expertise within the special educational needs field and in local government. It might be anticipated that membership of the panel will be determined in line with the prescribed requirements in 158(2) which presumably will include the requirement for local government experience. It would appear sensible to have this requirement written on to the face of the Bill".</p></blockquote>
Even if the Government are not prepared to concede that all the members of the panel should have experience in special needs and local government, we believe that it is essential that the majority should. I hope that the Government will give us the assurance that when any panel of three sits to determine a case, at least two will have special needs experience. Many of the people who will sit on a panel will have special educational needs experience and also local government experience. As the range of special needs is so wide, we want panel members—from whom a tribunal will be drawn—to have that spread of experience and knowledge at their disposal. Therefore, the appropriate people could be selected for membership of a tribunal, with the choice being dependent upon the special needs of each child. This is a complex matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman reflect upon the phrasing of his amendment, which includes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"members of which must have recent experience and knowledge of special educational needs."</p></blockquote>
Does he want all members of the panel, the majority, or some, to have experience and knowledge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ideally, all members should have it. That was our purpose in tabling the amendment. We would be prepared to accept that chairmen of panels who did not have this experience might be appointed, in which case it would be important for the other two members of the panel to have the relevant experience. I understand that the chairmen would be lawyers with at least seven years experience. We accept that it might not always be possible to find people with that experience to take tribunal hearings, but we hope that that could be done in some cases. As a last resort, we think that the lay members of a tribunal should be people with experience of special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 640, which has been worded carefully to ensure that it complies with what appears in the special educational needs document "Access to the System" which was published in July and which the hon. Member for Bridgend mentioned. Paragraph 34 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regional tribunals would be drawn from a panel of legally qualified chairmen, and from a panel of members, some of whom would have experience and expertise within the special education needs field and in local government."</p></blockquote>
It does not state that all would have; it specifies that some "would". It covers experience of special educational needs and local government. I have tried to reflect those words in my amendment and I fail to understand why Conservative Members would have difficulty in accepting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having been a member of the Committee for some time, I can predict the Minister's reply. He will probably say that the amendment is not necessary because it is covered in other parts of the Bill. He might draw my attention to clause 158(2) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person may be appointed member of the lay panel unless he satisfies such requirements as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
No doubt the Minister will say that the proposed code of practice that will be announced today, which will in some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1159</span>
way be statutorily binding, will include the very words in my amendment. If that is so, I may be willing to withdraw the amendment. However, if the amendment meets Government requirements, it should be accepted. It adds few words to the Bill and would clarify any uncertainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the amendment has been carefully worded. I have followed the argument of the hon. Member for Bath about the best way to effect his intention. Is it intended that the members to which the amendment refers should have expertise in both special educational needs and local government? Would the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) be satisfied if one member of the tribunal had experience of both? Interpretation can cause legal difficulties. One possible interpretation of the amendment is that the tribunal would require a member to have experience in both local government and special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point, but I have difficulty with his semantics. The amendment mentions "members". If several members have experience of local government and special educational needs, that would be welcome, but it is not a requirement. One member with experience of local government and another with expertise in special educational needs makes two members. That would fulfil the amendment's requirements. It is important to establish the principle of the amendment. The Government's intentions are set out in their document, "Access to the System". It would be more interesting to hear the Minister's response to the debate than to have exchanges across the Committee with the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's last point, but I believe that it would be helpful to express a view on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the intention of the amendments. It is desirable for people with expertise to be members of tribunals that deal with provision for children with special educational needs. The tribunal will consist of three people. The types of people who can serve on it are, therefore, limited, unless different sorts of expertise are bundled in one person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrasing of the two amendments that tackle the subject is different. At first, they appeared to be similar. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bridgend could imply that all members of the tribunal should have expertise in special educational needs. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath states "shall include members", which makes clear that not all members need to have such expertise. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) made a valid point about the wording of the "Bath" amendment, which implies that some members should have expertise in both special educational needs and local government. The hon. Member for Bath said that he did not intend that. His intention could be clarified by using the phrase "and members who".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "Bridgend" amendment uses the word recent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is correct and the amendment implies that members of the tribunal should have expertise in both local government and special
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
educational needs, that applies to the Government document, "Access to the System", which uses the same words. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can clarify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not being critical. The hon. Member for Bath clarified his intention in his explanation. The intention of the amendment and the document can be explained, but we have to be careful when drafting law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend did not expand on the meaning of "recent", but his amendment refers to "recent experience" of special educational needs. A person can have "experience" only if he has benefited from such education. Therefore, his amendment proposes that some of the members should be graduates of special needs education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be true in a narrow sense and it may improve the quality of the panel, but my use of the term "recent experience" relates to people who have been involved in this sector recently and not to people who were involved 20 years ago but who then moved on to other work and had no further experience. That was what I meant by the word "recent".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I am probing the wording of the amendment. The word "knowledge", which is the second term that he uses, is more important. We need knowledge and expertise on the tribunals. I just question whether everyone needs that knowledge, because other abilities could usefully be brought to bear on the tribunal's discussions and decisions. I am interested to know how my hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that tribunals contain such expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly unclear about the role of the president vis-à-vis the chairman. I am not sure whether the chairman is the president: in which case, why do we use both terms? Clause 157(2)(a) refers to the "President of the Tribunal" and clause 157(2)(b) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a panel of persons … who may serve as chairman of the Tribunal".</p></blockquote>
There cannot be a chairman and a president of the same three-member tribunal, but perhaps I have misunderstood. It would be helpful if that could be clarified for me as a layman so that I could pass that information on to the lay people outside the Committee who may wish to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my question to the Minister on that point. Clause 158(1) provides that the president of the tribunal shall have a seven year general qualification within the meaning of section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1900. Will he have to have a legal qualification? I am sure that some people without a legal qualification would be perfectly capable of chairing the tribunal with distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not an intervention on the speech of the hon. Member for Battersea. If the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) wishes to put a question to the Minister, he should do so separately by making his own speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two sorts of expertise. We should deal separately with expertise on special needs education. Expertise on local government referred to in the Bath
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1161</span>
amendment may be desirable but should not be mentioned in the same breath as expertise on special needs education, which the Minister should make a requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support both amendments. The Bill should protect people with special educational needs and ensure proper provision to meet those needs. The appointment of a tribunal is encouraging. It will divorce the matter from the LEAs responsible for the initial decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, special needs education is a complex issue. That was acknowledged by the Warnock report and the Education Act 1981. To give as fair hearing, it is crucial that all members of the tribunal appreciate that complexities could arise from a meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be necessary for members to listen to arguments about competing categories of special needs for a pupil and to make judgments about priority needs, since the placement is often related to such judgment. The Committee must get bored to tears of my relating my experiences in a special school, but I can speak only from experience. Many children often have multi-needs: most children in my school had moderate learning difficulties, but they also had social, emotional and behavioural problems as well. Some even had a physical disability. In such circumstances, decisions must be made on the priority need, while recognising other needs of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to conceive of a tribunal that would satisfy such demands without all of its members having appropriate knowledge. I do not believe that the tribunal can consider all those categories if its members do not have experience with children with special educational needs. I do not suggest that only people who have experience with special needs children could do the job, but the tribunal would be fairer if its members had appropriate experience with children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A pool of people should be available to serve on the tribunal, in which all members should have certain expertise and experience in the categories that I have previously mentioned. They can be called upon when the circumstances arise. Amendment 350 refers to that issue and would strengthen the Bill in the interests of pupils and parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support amendment No. 640, although I think that it is badly worded. Therefore, I chastise the hon. Member for Bath. However, it is an important amendment and if the Government cannot accept its exact wording, I hope that they will at least be sympathetic to its intention and will table their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 640 addresses the potential criticism from LEAs that pupils' interests alone may be considered. That is an important point. On the one hand, parents wish to feel that they are getting a fair deal, but, on the other hand, it is important that the LEA feels that it is getting a fair deal. If members on the tribunal have experience of special educational needs to represent the parents and children, there should also be members who have experience of local government. Decisions by local government are often made for certain reasons, such as resources reasons, but if nobody on the tribunal has appropriate experience in local government, the LEA might think that its case is not being represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we ensure that at least one member of the tribunal has experience in local government and special education needs knowledge, local authorities will think that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
tribunal will give a fair decision. The amendment would satisfy demands for representatives with relevant experience on tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs may take decisions because of constraints upon them—constraints that may be at the root of the appeal. LEAs may not feel that those points are being taken sufficiently seriously and may therefore have no confidence in the tribunal system. I support the concept of a tribunal; I am not trying to wreck the proposal. A tribunal system has long been necessary and I am glad that the Bill includes it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very few parents use the special education appeal process because the present system is considered unsatisfactory. The appeal committee cannot take a decision that will require the LEA to alter its statement. That is a tremendous weakness. If LEAs are fairly represented, they will accept that if they are forced to change the statement the decision was taken with the consent of people who have experience of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that many people, of whom I am one, welcome the introduction of the tribunal, not least because it will substitute the current two-stage process with a one-stage process? There are anxieties about how the tribunals will be established in the Bill, because of the great formality involved. The amendments would put on the tribunals people who understand both sides of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. The principle of the tribunal is important and the amendments would improve the Bill. I hope that the Government will take account of what has been said this morning and support the principle, if not the wording, of the amendment and perhaps table an alternative drafting on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present system, when a local education authority refuses to alter a statement after appeal, the parents have to go through a long and tortuous process of appeal to the Secretary of State before any change to the statement can be made. More importantly, there are no consistent rules that say who should be on LEA appeals committees. Their formulation is often a mystery to the school and to the parents. That is the present, crazy system. The proposed changes will improve the entire appeals system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal should be supported because it holds out hope of consistency for parents and LEAs. However, the new appeals tribunal appears to replicate the inconsistency of the old appeals system because it does not state that certain people on the tribunal should have the required expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 157(5) refers toregulations that will be enacted after the Bill is made law, but those regulations will refer only to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, not to the membership. It is important that the tribunal consists of members who have experience of those with special educational needs and who understand how local authorities carry out their responsibilities for special education. That was recognised by Baroness Blatch, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Membership"—</p></blockquote>
of the tribunal—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would comprise a legally qualified chairman and two other members, one of whom would need to have expertise in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0749">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>
special educational needs and the other one of whom might have experience in local government."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 June 1992; Vol. 538, c. 610.]</p></blockquote>
That commitment was repeated in "Access to the System", but it was not replicated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that primary legislation should outline the experience and expertise of the tribunal. It should be noted that the amendment refers to expertise in local government and is not confined to the role of LEAs. Parents and LEAs need reassuring that tribunal decisions will be made by members who understand the issues behind special education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to witness so much consensus in the Committee about the creation of the tribunals and the need for inclusion in them of people with expertise in special education. However, the amendments are rendered unnecessary by clause 158(2) and the Government's proven commitment to the inclusion on the panel of people with special education experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Implicit in the Opposition's arguments is the belief that people with experience of special educational needs will come from the present educational system. However, many people in voluntary organisations outwith the educational system do tremendous work with children with special educational needs. Such people should not be excluded from membership of the panels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At no time did I say that the panel should consist solely of people from LEAs or of special educational needs professionals. People from the voluntary organisations such as Mencap certainly should be included and their expertise made use of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that, and hope that other Opposition Members agree with the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg). It would be an enormous shame to exclude from the pool of people who could serve on the panels those who could contribute so constructively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For two reasons I take stronger exception to the inclusion on the panels of people with local government knowledge. First, parents often will be arguing against their LEA. They will not be satisfied with a panel that they believe is biased against them. We must be very cautious about including someone who has experience of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the panel is the court of last resort, as well as the court of appeal, for parents who wish to send their children to non-maintained special schools. I was pleased that last week the Opposition were keen to encourage non-maintained schools, but having an LEA representative on the tribunal will ensure that no children are sent to such schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady's experience of constituency cases not oblige her to agree that there are always two sides to every story?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and sometimes local education authorities can be wrong. One wants to be as fair-minded as possible. Clause 160, which we shall discuss later, states who can be called as witnesses. If a parent is arguing against a local education authority, the panel should not be biased by the inclusion of someone from the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not necessarily have to be someone who is a serving officer of a member of a local authority. The hon. Lady must also appreciate that most places in non-maintained schools and independent special schools are already paid for by local authorities, which sent children to them. There should be no fear that local authorities will not be prepared to send children to such schools. They do so already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's points. I sincerely hope that the panel would not consist of people who are currently serving officers of local authorities. Panel members should not be taken away from a job for which the taxpayer is paying. One would assume that the panel members have retired. However, once in local government, always in local government and such people would create a natural bias in favour of local government's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that most local education authorities pay the fees of childen in the non-maintained sector, but there is a bias against sending children to such schools. An example of that now exists in my constituency. I would be worried, as I am sure that parents would equally be, if the panel were biased by the inclusion of a member who is geared to local government thinking. Parents must often battle with the local authority so that their child can be sent to a non-maintained or independent school. Therefore, it would a shame to include, on the panel, as of right, people with local government experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I said that it would be good practice not to have too many of them, too often, on the panels, especially in cases when parents are arguing against the local education authority.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people would be interested in serving on panels. They could come from the voluntary sector, they could be recently retired, perhaps with experience in personnel or in working with disabled people in business.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends whether that was the principal interest, but I expect that it would not be regarded as recent experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pick up a point made, I think, by the hon. Member for City of Durham about the chairman's role. Many of us have wide experience, from different areas of work, in dealing with tribunals and panels, chaired, usually, by people with legal experience. They have had to ensure, over many years, that the decisions that they came to were seen as fair. I would expect the same to apply to the chairman of the new panel. The fact that decisions are seen to be fair contributes to the acceptance of such systems. I see this as the chairman's fundamental role. He or she should bring his or her legal expertise and knowledge of special education to the proceedings to ensure that decsions are fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for having spoken for longer than I intended. I hope that the Minister will accept that the Committee supports the inclusion on the panel of people with recent experience of special education, but that that matter is already covered by clauses 157 and 158. We do not need a specific amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to take part in the debate, but I should like to make clear what was behind the interventions that I made. I do not want, in doing so, to inject any note of controversy or rancour into the debate, because I believe that there is wide consensus in the Committee about the way that the tribunal should operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait). The main concern behind the clause and the amendments is for the operation of the tribunal in a way that commands the confidence of those appearing before it. The right of appeal to the tribunal is an important one, which will be taken extremely seriously by parties who appear before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with all tribunals, it is important that there should be absolute confidence in the tribunal and that that justice should be done and be seen to be done. That is at the top of the list of requirements. It must be decided whether the amendments would help to achieve that end. Often one can see what the amendments are after, but it is questionable whether they are the best way to achieve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1166</span>
The amendment is a good example. After listening to the arguments, I wonder whether it would be better to leave the amendment's requirements out and leave things to the regulations. I shall listen to what the Minister says about that with interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would make it possible to get into difficulties which could lead to inflexibility, causing the opposite result to that intended. It is not clear whether amendment No. 350 intends that every member of the tribunal should
	<br><blockquote><p>"have recent experience and knowledge of special educational needs."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would be inserted after the words "Special Educational Needs Tribunal" in the clause, so would that be the amendment's effect? I would appreciate guidance from the Minister and those with greater legal knowledge than myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 157(1) establishes the special educational needs tribunal, and its structure suggests that the tribunal as an institution, not a specific tribunal, is referred to. That is borne out by what is stated in subsection (2) about a president of the tribunal and a chairman of individual tribunals. The amendment seems to require that every member of the special educational needs tribunal should have such experience. Its acceptance may cause difficulties in the courts. That would be inflexible and do less justice to this matter than the provision of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be particularly regrettable if such inflexibility applied to a tribunal chairman. My hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest made a good point about the requirement in clause 158. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Bath that the tribunal should not be too formal. It should be as informal as possible, but rigorous and able to carry out its functions in a quasi judicial fashion to do cases justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to clarify the issues relating to the amendments? The hon. Gentleman may have noticed that the wording of our amendments is different. Amendment No. 350 states "members of which" whereas amendment No. 351—which is not being debated—refers to members of the lay panel and states what we intend. We want all members of the lay panel to have experience. Amendment No. 350 does not specify all members, but "members".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I was specifically concerned that the amendment would be inserted on line 2 of page 92 after "Tribunal". It does not refer to the members of particular panels, which is the point that the hon. Gentleman made. I interpret "Tribunal" to include a special educational needs tribunal, a tribunal president and the chairman of an individual panel. I look to the Minister for guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is relevant to the chairmanship of the panel. My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye has referred to clause 160. It contains a list of quasi legal powers which will be granted to the tribunal which are important to enable it to do justice in each case. Clause 160(2)(g) states that the tribunal would have the power to grant
	<br><blockquote><p>"discovery or inspection of documents".</p></blockquote>
That would be crucial to satisfy people appearing before the tribunal that it has had sight of all the documents relating to their child's education and background, which the local education authority or another body might possess. That would enable justice to be done. Such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
powers are, in many respects, quasi legal powers. It is clear from clause 160(5) how important the power of discovery and inspection is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is important in choosing the chairman of the tribunal who, under clause 158(1), must have a legal background to be able to carry out his duties. The amendment to line 2 of clause 157 might hamper the appointment of such a person as chairman of the tribunal because it might be difficult to find someone with the required legal background who also has
	<br><blockquote><p>"recent experience and knowledge of special educational needs".</p></blockquote>
That might seem to be a far-fetched example, but such a difficulty might arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the number of cases that parents have had to take to the courts, some eminent QCs could be named by many members of the Committee as suitable for appointment as president of the tribunal and, having seven years' experience, able to undertake the required legal functions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but I can foresee difficulties and inflexibility arising with such appointments. In this brief speech I am anxious to make the point that the tribunal should be constituted in such a way that it can do justice in each case. The best way of doing that would be to leave it to the regulations, rather than to include the wording of the amendment in the clause. As I said, there might be much agreement on the issue. I cannot imagine that anyone would not want members with experience of special educational needs on the tribunal. However, I question whether the amendment is the best way of fulfilling that intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This interesting and broadly good-natured debate will be helpful to my Department when considering how the innovatory proposals for the tribunal should be advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate was opened by the hon. Member for Bridgend who moved the amendment and, at least until the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, the participants spoke in alphabetical order. The hon. Member for Bath spoke to his amendment and I appreciate that Bath precedes Bridgend, but there was a certain tidiness to our proceedings and a certain unity—not uniformity—in the contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend suggested that in putting flesh on the proposals in the consultative document—which has been generally, if not universally, well received—the qualification required for membership of the tribunal was that of renaissance man, with all the attributes of legal experience, and of knowledge of local government and special educational needs. At least one participant in our debate—the hon. Member for City of Durham—would qualify on two counts, but not on the third. The Department for Education may aspire to the qualifications of renaissance man and may even pretend to have them on occasions, but I do not claim such wide
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
expertise. The debate has exposed the difficulty that not every panel member will have that range of expertise. The important goal is to get the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the hon. Member for Bath has already smoked me out about the response that I hope that the Committee will give to the amendment. I shall not advise the Committee to support it for reasons that the hon. Gentleman has anticipated by implication. I agree that the tribunal should have a balanced membership. That is not in doubt. The tribunal must be seen to be impartial and independent if it is to succeed. However, that impartiality and independence would be difficult to achieve if we were to impose tests requiring either that all tribunal members should be knowledgeable about special education but lack a corresponding degree of knowledge of local government, or that they should be knowledgeable about both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is worried about the tribunal's independence. Would it not engender more confidence in people who appeal to it to know that the people hearing their cases had recent experience and knowledge of special needs education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can develop my case by drawing on my experience. My objectives are the same as the hon. Gentleman's. The balance of membership advocated in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bath is very similar to what the Government envisage. The remarks of my noble Friend in another place have been referred to, and it is our intention that each tribunal sitting will consist of three members. One member would act as chairman and would be drawn from the chairmen's panel of lawyers appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The other two members would be drawn from the lay panel appointed by the Secretary of State for Education. To maintain the desired balance of expertise, the Government have suggested that each tribunal should consist of one member with local government experience and one with special educational needs expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I offer my services as panel chairman? I am a former leader of a local authority and a former head teacher of a special school, so I must be the perfect choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To assist the hon. Gentleman, I am certainly happy to receive any such suggestions, especially from such well qualified sources. However, I advise the hon. Gentleman to be aware of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, or he will get into difficulty. I do not prejudge his eligibility, but the matter must be considered carefully. That is the point. The Government are not looking for people who have expertise only in one discipline or another. It is reasonable to say that there may be renaissance people whose experience spans both, or even all three, relevant disciplines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The narrow question is whether the composition of the tribunal should be defined in primary legislation or in regulations. Clause 158(2) is not strictly germane to the amendment, but it deals with the constitution of the membership of the panels rather than with the constitution of the panel itself. It also refers to the prescription of requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat relieved that my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) is not present, as I know that he smells a rat when such matters are prescribed in regulations. However, regulations are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1169</span>
flexible and can be consulted about before the tribunal is appointed. I shall comment on that relative to my own experience and then comment generally about the way in which the Department envisages the tribunal working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why I was pleased to relieve my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Schools of the burden of dealing with those provisions is that I have experience of other tribunals. My experience is not in this sector because, in a sense, the tribunal is new. My experience of special educational needs is only that of constituents who have come to me with family problems. Other hon. Members will have other experience. The hon. Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) has experience of industrial tribunals. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere gives us legal advice and, to reply to the point from my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest about a legal chairman, the magisterial interventions of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere explained admirably the case for a legal chairman. Those colleagues have well-established and well-precedented experience of tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience was as a member of the agricultural land tribunal for a couple of years, about 10 years ago. It resolved disputes between landlords and tenants, and in related matters. I also have further, somewhat unusual, experience which may be germane. I became special adviser at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at the time that milk quotas were introduced and it was necessary to establish a milk quota tribunal. I cannot claim authorship of that structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Enright 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemsworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is your fault, then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman is blaming me too quickly. The decision in principle had been taken in Europe. Before I joined the Ministry, I found myself in the whirl of trying to introduce an administrative system from scratch, and everyone did remarkably well. At least I have the benefit of some idea of the considerations that occur when a Government Department needs, for good reasons, to establish a tribunal or similar body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider the tried and trusted structure of tripartism. I firmly defend in this context—because it works very well—the proposal for a legal chairman and two lay members who, in a sense, may be perceived as being associated with the interests being confronted in each case. I say "in a sense" because I took careful note of the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye about bias. I want to reassure my hon. Friend that there would be no question of bias in the empanelment of tribunals. For example, we would not expect to empanel as a member an employee of a local authority that was in dispute in a case. In the exercise of their duties, all members of the tribunal, irrespective of where they came from, owe a duty to the tribunal: I am advised that this is a common law duty to avoid bias, and there is redress if they behave in a scandalous manner. They may be retired local government officials, or even retired Members of Parliament. They will probably be well out of the hurly-burly of things, but will have the all-important expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked myself the other day whether I was a farmer or a landowner for the purposes of the tribunal of which I was a member for a couple of years. I cannot remember, but I decided that I was probably a farmer and that I had been empanelled in that capacity. In all my experience there, I cannot recall a case in which, effectively, we took sides. It may be less easy in these cases, which I agree are different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1170</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we know precisely from where those people come. Will the list of people suitable to serve on the tribunals be compiled by the Cabinet Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In conformity with the usual practice, the Lord Chancellor will keep the list of legal chairmen and will draw from that. The Secretary of State for Education will keep the lay lists. He will have access to advice, including that from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales on Welsh tribunals, on which the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) may want to comment in our debate on clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Secretary of State appoints the lay individuals, will he draw on lists compiled by the public appointments office within the Cabinet Office? Will the Minister clarify that procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my advice. It is open to members of the Committee and other hon. Members to suggest potential nominees within the set parameters. It is an established procedure and, as I said earlier, in my experience, when people get down to the job and listen to a case, it is difficult to say. "He is from special needs, he is from the LEA." Most people, properly, consider the issues in the case and they have a duty to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no great difficulty about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience of tribunals is that each member benefits from the expertise of others. I do not mean by that that I obtained a legal qualification on the cheap, or that I would try to undercut the hon. Member for Wallsend, merely that, with experience, members become more familiar with the procedure of tribunals, with the rules of evidence and with what can properly be said. It is inconceivable that someone with a local authority background who was empanelled to a tribunal would not quickly become familiar with the problems of special educational needs. it is argued that people with a SEN background should automatically be empanelled, but that is not always possible. It may be better in those cases to call expert witnesses to testify on the subject. A lay panel must operate within tried and established rules and principles, while taking account of the views of experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say, briefly, how we envisage that the panel will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the subject, it is important that he reiterates what he said earlier: that there will be members with experience of special educational needs and those with local government experience. I hope that he will make that absolutely clear. How he will ensure that that will be the case? He drew attention, as I did, to clause 158(2), but he has not placed on the official record that those requirements and regulations will include the specification that membership must be as he described. Will the Minister do so now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are times when my wife says that I find it impossible to say whether or not I want the pepper and salt. The short answer to the hon. Gentleman is yes, there will be regulations that will set out what the hon. Gentleman wants. I am sure that they will be to the satisfaction of the Committee. However, having said that, I qualify it in one respect only: there must be flexibility in operation. We said earlier that we do not want to rule someone out because he has expertise in two fields, or because he has no expertise in the relevant subject. However, there are peculiar events in tribunals when it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1171</span>
becomes inconvenient to proceed on a strict basis. For example, the hon. Member for Bath will find, embedded in clause 160, the possibility of changing the numbers of a tribunal in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall my tribunal meeting to consider a long and complex case for roughly a whole week, on one day of which, the legal chairman was unable to attend. There was a factual matter about agriculture—the conduct or state of husbandry of a particular piece of land—which was not directly the substance of the dispute that had been brought to evidence. The chairman said, "I'm prepared to authorise you two to study this and give me a written report and then we shall include it in the evidence." That is precisely what we did and it proved to be useful flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the milk quota incident. I sat on a case that involved a leading silk—they come not too cheaply, I understand. We heard half the evidence and then he had to leave for three months before the case was completed. I am not suggesting that that is a model of this case—I shall discuss that in a moment. During that break, I was appointed as an official in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, thereby becoming ineligible to serve, and we had to get a special arrangement, with the agreement of the parties, so that I could continue to sit on the case until its conclusion, otherwise it would have been extremely inconvenient for all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are simple examples from my own experience about the way in which it is sometimes necessary to work flexibly. I hope that I have answered the basic principle satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not choose his words as carefully as he might have done when he gave his examples of flexibility. He said that, embedded in clause 160, there were opportunities to change the number of members. Where is that in clause 160? The only reference to membership is that the tribunal can continue if one of the members is ill. That is hardly the flexibility that the Minister implied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the part of the clause that I had in mind. The basic principle and the practice of tribunals follows the procedure that I have described. In clause 161, the tribunal is brought within the overall purview of the council on tribunals, as are all tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reference to definition and, occasionally, practice at a tribunal, there may be differing circumstances, but normally the approach is as I have set it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall mention another point, which entertained me while I was serving on a tribunal. Nobody on the tribunal had ever subpoenaed anybody before, but we had to do it because the witness would not come—he did not wish to be drawn between the two parties—unless he was obliged to give evidence. At lunchtime, we had to ring up the Lord Chancellor to get permission and to ask about the form of words to say to the witness. The witness duly arrived and gave extremely constructive evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, this is an important body of law, but, in such sensitive cases, it must be as flexible as possible. I do not mean that there should be uncertainty about the membership of the tribunal; but, the system must work in a sensitive, simple and straightforward way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1172</span>
The hon. Member for Bath has slightly sidetracked me from making a point that I was determined to make to the Committee. I am anxious that, wherever possible, we should not become over-legalistic. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said that there are points of law that must be addressed. I appreciate that point, but from my experience I am concerned that there occurs what I call an arms race. The tribunal beings as a semi-friendly gathering at a lay level to explore a particular issue. Gradually, somebody produces a solicitor, so the other side produces a barrister and before one knows where one is there are leading silks and huge expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to gainsay my friends in the legal profession—that would be a dangerous thing to do—nor am I suggesting that there may not be occasions when it is sensible and appropriate to have legal representation. In certain types of case, I may wish to encourage the parties to adopt a state of self-denying ordinance in which they both agree—rather like in a small claims court—to leave their lawyers aside and to argue the matter before the tribunal under their own terms. That may be sensible and it leads me on to a more general point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. What I said earlier related to the chairman of the tribunal and his exercise of powers. As I suggested in my speech, the informality of the process is vital, as the hon. Member for Bath rightly said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most relieved to hear that. If my hon. Friends who are lawyers say that, it is a good endorsement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole approach of the Department—in the consultative document, in relation to subsequent representations and in response to the general tone of the Committee—is to remind the parties involved and those operating the tribunal that one is dealing with sensitive cases, involving people who may be vulnerable and anxious about their children. I hope that that atmosphere will permeate the tribunal. In other words, we are not trying to score points or to show how clever people are. If I may express it this way, we are trying to meet the needs of children through a means that is appropriate, having regard to all the circumstances and to the code of practice, which is central to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this conection, I should admit something on behalf of the Department: with one modest exception, the tribunal is broadly new ground for our Department. We are not a big tribunal generator. This is really the first substantial tribunal that our Department has established. We have already benefited from the accumulated wisdom of the Council for Tribunals and thus from the experience of other tribunals. This morning's debate has been valuable as part of the learning curve and in developing points which our officials can consider and which will, I hope, be part of the consultative programme of the regulations. I should stress that when starting from scratch with people who have not been on tribunals before—although some may have been and, plainly, the legal chairman may have been, in a different way—they will not be familiar with the substance of the tribunal's work. Therefore, it is important that we give proper induction and training so that those empanelled, especially in the early stages, have some experience of what is happening. That does not preclude the legal chairman or the representatives of either interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need maximum consultation as the regulations are brought forward. That is another reason why I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1173</span>
reluctant to concede the suggestion that we should be over-prescriptive in the Bill. The tribunals should offer a degree of convenience of location and of informality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, I was talking to a West Sussex county councillor, Sally Greenwell. She had spotted the point about regional tribunals and was worried that it might be necessary to travel great distances to a regional centre to conclude a case. As I look at the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell), I can imagine people travelling, from Beccles to Cambridge as Cambridge is the regional administrative centre for many matters. I do not believe that that is what is envisaged. It is much better to have a sensible network of places—not necessarily in the very home town, of the parties involved, but at least reasonably accessible to them. We shall bear that in mind in what we bring forward. If possible, we shall emphasise the importance of informality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Committee to remember that the tribunal is a second line of defence. It may reinforce the first line which I shall explicate in a moment. In a way, if cases come before the tribunal, the procedures have failed. The essence of the process is for parents to take their case to the LEA for the LEA to consider it and to produce a sensible, agreed package that is embodied in a statement. The last thing that I support is allowing LEAs to sit back and say, "Let it all hang out in a tribunal", without first making an effort. That has happened in the planning world. If LEAs did that, they would fail in their duty and not comply with the code of practice. If the existence of a tribunal encourages LEAs to deal seriously and promptly with parents' problems so that as few cases as possible are heard at the tribunal, that would be welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend deal with the matter of the chairman and president?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will deal with that immediately. I understand that the president will preside over the whole tribunal, but he may act as chairman in specific cases. The chairman chairs a panel of the tribunal that considers a specific case. It is likely that the president may chair some panels, especially when the tribunal is first set up, to gain hands-on experience of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always better to reach agreement locally, but the Bill provides for an appeals system in cases where that is not possible. I assure the hon. Members for Bridgend and for Bath that the tribunal will be independent. It will be seen to be to represent all the interests relevant and expertise appropriate to sensitive cases. We shall use the tribunal to provide quicker delivery of appeals against refusals to issue statements, or against the terms and conditions of statements as set out in the Education Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall provide additional rights of appeal against refusal to make an assessment or to reassess, against a decision to cease to maintain a statement, and against a school named in a statement. Those rights are specific and will be useful for parents. Above all, we seek to provide speedy, universal and user-friendly means of redress for parents in the difficult circumstances that I have outlined. We are satisfied that the Bill is flexible and provides for regulations to enshrine detailed arrangements. It is well precedented and will deliver our aims. I hope that the Committee will accept those assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We wish to be generous to the Minister. We look forward to reading what he said to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1174</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to speak to the Committee, and especially the Minister, about an omission in the clause. I am sure that the omission was unintentional. I hope that the Minister can tell us how the clause will apply to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To speak of regional tribunals in the same breath as Wales is not considered gracious in the Principality. Wales should have a national, not a regional, tribunal for several reasons, which are not necessarily separatist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh education system is, to some extent, different from that in England. Wales also has a separate Government Department, which is presumably responsible for all educational matters in Wales, including special needs education and the tribunal. What is the nature of the tribunal in Wales? Will there be regional meetings? The Minister referred to East Anglia and Cambridge and agreed that people sometimes have to travel great distances to attend tribunals. Like him, I was a member of a tribunal for some years dealing with rating and valuation matters. He referred also to the need for informality. Often people who attend tribunals are not used to the procedures of law, neither are they used to travelling great distances. It takes me as long to drive from my constituency to that of the Minister of State as it does to go by motorway to Scotland. The distances and journeys involved in Wales must be taken into account when setting up a structure of tribunals on special needs education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made an interesting point about the membership of the tribunals and who should appoint the ordinary members. He said that he would take advice from the Lord Chancellor about the lawyers on the panel, but that the Secretary of State for Education would be responsible for the selection of the members of the tribunal aided by the Secretary of State for Wales. It is ironic that in the past few months Opposition Members have been grumbling about the number of appointments that the Secretary of State for Wales makes. However, if it is between him and the Secretary of State for Education, I hope that the Secretary of State for Wales will have the sole discretion to decide who should be members of the tribunal within the boundaries of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is Wales not mentioned in the Bill? Will there be a separate Welsh tribunal? Will that tribunal be able to meet other than in Cardiff? Will the Secretary of State for Wales be solely responsible for the appointment of the membership of the tribunal so far as it affects Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Torfaen said, the clause is of great importance. Indeed, this part of the Bill is of special interest to us in Wales because we have 14,000 children with statements, which represents about 2·9 per cent. of the school population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, for this part of the Bill there is no difference between England and Wales. The title of Secretary of State covers both my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Education and the Secretary of State for Wales. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Secretary of State for Wales has special responsibility for education in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1175</span>
I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's specific points. Where appeals are lodged in respect of children with special educational needs in Wales, the tribunal will sit in Wales. The hon. Gentleman asked whether it will sit anywhere other than Cardiff. We shall have to see what cases come before the tribunal and adopt the flexible approach that my hon. Friend proposed for England. We should be just as flexible and take into account the convenience of parents and everyone else concerned when deciding where the tribunal will sit. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State will provide staff and accommodation for the tribunal and that could be anywhere in Wales. We shall consider the detailed arrangements with the Department for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On membership of the tribunal, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales will be able to nominate tribunal members to ensure that Welsh interests are covered. There is nothing new about that. In conjunction with other Departments, we make certain appointments to bodies that have a general application throughout England and Wales. In this case, the hon. Member for Torfaen would not, I think, argue—any more than I would—for a separate tribunal for Wales to operate this part of the Bill. We need a consistency of approach. That will be best achieved by an England and Wales tribunal to which we will nominate Welsh members to safeguard Welsh interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered whether when the tribunal, when it sits in Wales and if the occasion requires it, will be able to conduct its proceedings in Welsh. There is no reason, in principle, why it should not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered most of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised, but if there are further queries I shall endeavour to answer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the Minister, I would argue for the establishment of an autonomous body for Wales. That is perfectly reasonable. The fact that that has not been proposed is an anomaly because there will be a funding council for Wales and a curriculum and assessment authority for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the points made by the hon. Member for Torfaen, and I would like to add a further cultural and linguistic dimension—I am sure that members of the Committee are expecting me to raise that matter. The cultural background is crucial. The tribunal needs to be sensitive to the nature of the cultural community in Wales in determining to what extent a child has a special educational need. We need to develop our own expertise in Wales and a national tribunal for Wales would encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dyslexia unit at the university of Wales Bangor is doing interesting work. The problems of dyslexia and literacy are related to bilingualism. In a bilingual environment, our understanding of the problem of dyslexia and associated problems of literacy is bound to be different, as is our approach to the treatment of dyslexia. When my son's condition was considered, it was recommended that he concentrate on his first language, which was Welsh. Clearly that was not a realistic option: it was an unreasonable suggestion because he, like all of us in Wales, needs to operate in a world where English is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1176</span>
dominant, especially in the commercial and official business world. That is an example of a failure to take account of the linguistic dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem exists in all parts of Wales because Welsh is a foundation subject in the national curriculum. Bilingualism needs to be taken into account when considering special educational needs, especially learning difficulties associated with literacy problems because of dyslexia or similar conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one other piece of evidence of the failure to deal with problems arising from bilingualism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman deals with that point, may I remind him that there are grants available to support the specialist teaching required under the grant for education support and training programme? For example, next year the programme will cover the training of teachers of the hearing and visually impaired; the training of teachers of children with severe learning difficulties; the training of teachers in ordinary schools with a designated responsibility for SEN; the initial training of educational psychologists; a regional resource for children who are both deaf and blind and projects to encourage the integration of children with SEN into mainstream settings.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) resumes, I must say that we cannot have another debate on special needs.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Sir John. I appreciate what the Minister said and hope that such resources will be made available to avoid the bizarre situation where monolingual Welsh-speaking children with speech impediments have had to receive speech therapy from monolingual English-speaking people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal should be sensitive to cultural backgrounds. The Minister should make the commitment that the members will include people experienced in and sensitive to bilingualism. I repeat, many in Wales look forward to having an autonomous tribunal existing side by side with the other autonomous education institutions that we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me answer the hon. Gentleman immediately. Of course, we shall take such factors into account when we appoint people from Wales to the tribunal. We shall bear the linguistic situation vey much in mind. I should like to reaffirm what I said earlier. There should be an England and Wales tribunal to maintain consistency of approach. The hon. Member for Torfaen agreed with that. We must not forget that the code of practice will apply to England and Wales, so the criteria for both countries will be consistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the Minister's remarks were useful, especially those about language which was discussed by the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North. The Tribunal will meet in a part of Wales where Welsh predominates and where people experience difficulties travelling. I disagree with what the Minister said was my view about an England and Wales tribunal. There is a case for a tribunal based in Wales and accountable to the Secretary of State for Wales. I understand that the rules, procedures and precedents governing such a tribunal would have to follow those of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1177</span>
the English tribunal, or vice versa. There is a case for amplifying these points during the remaining stages of the Bill's passage through the House and the other place. I am grateful to the Minister for his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to talk about Wales, though it is important. I support the remarks of my hon. Friends, but shall discuss the procedures governing membership of the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition welcome the simplification of the two-stage appeal system, even though the number of cases proceeding to an appeal to the Secretary of State is low. I am worried that the tribunal system will become a further wedge between parents and local education authorities. I should not wish that to happen. Some of the Minister's remarks this morning have allayed my fears somewhat, but it might be helpful if I were to explain my worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the system is being made more formal, adversarial and litigious. We have evidence that an increasing number of parents must use the law to obtain what they feel their children need from the local education authority. I understand that there were about 120 judicial reviews last year—a vast increase on previous numbers. A report in 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> of 15 January described some of the cases that have gone to judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth reminding the Committee why local education authorities are finding it difficult to meet some children's needs and why parents are undergoing the process of the law to obtain what they require for their children. The article in 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> quotes a representative of the Independent Panel for Special Education Advice, which works to put dissatisfied parents in touch with legal opinion. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A majority of enquiries to IPSEA, he says, are now to do with legal redress and he believes this is directly attributable to the declining quality of provision offered by local authorities. 'They are doing more and more to evade their legal duties so that more and more they are going to find themselves pursued through the legal processes.'"</p></blockquote>
The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While blaming the legislation as much as the authorities—who are under acute financial pressure—the report said that LEAs are guilty of unreasonable delays in producing statements and of then writing statements which minimise their financial commitment."</p></blockquote>
It is fairly obvious to me that that, because local education authorities are under-resourced, they are finding it more and more difficult to meet their legal requirements. Giving parents the power to take local education authorities to court does not redress that important problem. I should like the Minister to deal with that, although I know that he will not be able to satisfy me completely on the issue. The setting up of tribunals will have resource implications for local education authorities. We know that decisions will be binding. Local education authorities could lose yet more of their budgetary control to a body that does not have to bear the financial consequences of its decisions. It is important that local education authorities have the resources to meet the considerable costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the make-up of the tribunals, despite reassurance from the Minister this morning. Having had some slight experience of an industrial tribunal, I am not convinced that the correct way to proceed is to draw a chairman from a panel of legally qualified chairmen appointed by the Lord
	<span class='label label-info column'>1178</span>
Chancellor. That is my personal opinion. I do not speak for all Labour Members in saying that. I feel that a composition similar to that of the magistrates benches would be more efficient and accessible. That would include a chairman who was not legally qualified, advised by a legally-qualified clerk to the tribunal. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest also made that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for arguing for such a chairman is that legally qualified chairmen sometimes appear quite intimidating to the appellant, or hostile to advocates if they happen not to be lawyers. The chairman is often less familiar with the practical applications of the law in question than are those advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must try to ensure that the regional tribunals are as accessible to parents as possible and that they have no flavour of courts of law. The most suitable and likely parents' advocates would be not lawyers but educationists, IPSEA panel members and others with specialised knowledge of the requirements of the education Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the local education authority advocates are more likely to be lawyers, towards whom a legally qualified chairman may therefore be biased, it is important to reduce the amount of legal bias in the tribunals as much as possible. There is only a limited number of lawyers who have specialist experience of, and interest in, special needs legislation from which to choose. The Minister said that induction and training would be important, but it would be easier to find people with special needs experience and give them the required legal training rather than to do it the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am suggesting a way to keep costs down and trying to make the procedure as non-legalistic as possible. The Minister referred to the leading silk who "comes not too cheaply". It is in no one's interests to have full-scale, expensive legal battles in which leading silks and barristers are called to defend people's causes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations to be made later must be specific about the Minister's decision-making powers. I am anxious that the process may be weakened by the fact that many appeals involve issues about provisions that have to be made by other agencies. The Minister went some way to clarifying that point, but the system's great weakness is that the tribunal cannot legislate for provision that should be made by health authorities and the social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lack of clarification in my mind, although perhaps not in that of the Minister, about how the responsibilities would be attributed either to education, for which the tribunal is responsible, or to health and social services, for which it is not. It is a wonderful example of shared responsibility, which will cause the chaos and confusion that we described earlier in relation to funding agencies and LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without wishing to rehash our previous argument, I support one point made by the hon. Member for Cambridge, relating to clause 158(1). You gave her leeway to refer to it, Sir John, and I hope that you will allow me to do the same. The question is who should be qualified to chair these important tribunals, the success of which will have enormous bearing on the credibility of the special needs system and whether the public feel that it meets their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important aspect of the tribunals, as the Minister hinted earlier, is that they are sensitive, simple and straightforward and avoid being over-legalistic. We are breaking new ground and we should therefore be wary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1179</span>
of assuming an automatic precedent from existing tribunals such as employment and industrial relations tribunals. The people who come to the tribunals will often be nervous, upset and overwrought because they are considering the future education of their children. They may not be legally represented and, as the Minister, hinted they need to be in as informal an atmosphere as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my respect for the legal profession is well under control so that I am not one of those who liken lawyers to a rhino—thick-skinned, short-sighted and ever ready to charge—I do not believe that it has a monopoly on wisdom, which is the prime quality that we shall look for in people who chair such tribunals. I do not think that because a person is a lawyer he will necessarily make the tribunal over-legalistic or over-formal; I say only that this should not disqualify someone else, who may have equal qualifications in special education from doing the same thing. I suspect that most of the tribunals will be given legal advice about procedure from clerks, as many bodies are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government ought to think about clause 158(1). I do not think that it will necessarily add to the wisdom of the tribunals; it may tend to make them slightly formal and put fear into people who come before them in an overwrought and emotional state. I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to take the subsection away and review it by Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points for the Minister. When a tribunal considers appeals on statementing procedures, will it be tied by the rules that tie local authorities when they provide statements? They are charged specifically with ensuring that pupils are educated in schools in a way that is compatible with the efficient use of resources. Secondly, when a panel meets, all that it is entitled to do, according to my reading of schedule 10, is name an alternative school, or source of education. There are appeals in statementing procedures where parents want their children to stay at schools that they already attend but to have enhanced provision—for example, home tuition. Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to comment when he winds up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge and the hon. Member for Wyre Forest made an important point about the need to minimise the legalistic approach to the tribunals. I regret, Sir John, that you were unable to select an amendment relating to pre-arbitration procedure, which was proposed by organisations such as the Spastics Society, it would have set up a non-legalistic arbitration procedure that might resolve a problem between the disagreement over a statement and the tribunal hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current appeals procedure has had its problems, although Leeds and Bolton local authorities did handle appeals about statementing problems successfully. However, this success is not universal. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge mentioned the 120 cases that are under judicial review, and others that went to the Secretary of State. In a case in Wandsworth a few days ago, the Secretary of State intervened under his powers in section 68 of the Education Act 1944 to ensure that proper provision was made for a child with special educational needs. A non-legalistic tribunal, or an arbitration procedure beforehand could help resolve these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1180</span>
I have one or two anxieties about the staffing of tribunals. If they were staffed at the same ratios as tribunals that sit for the social security system, we could end up with a major backlog of cases. Figures for 1991 show that it took more than 15 weeks to handle many cases and that the average time for benefit cases of all types was up to six months. If people have to wait for three, four, five or six months for their cases to be heard before the tribunal, that will cause significant delays. I hope that the Minister will assure us that he will set a time limit—two months would not be too long—for the panels to deal with cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the tribunal becomes widely known, it is likely that it will generate many cases. The introduction of the disability living allowance and the publicity associated with it resulted in a huge backlog of cases. We hope that the tribunal panels will be sufficiently well staffed to keep waiting times down to a maximum of two months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider two problems regarding costs. One relates to the expenses of befrienders or people who represent parents in a case and particularly to their travel costs, which could be substantial, unless the tribunal is peripatetic and holds the hearing in the town of the person making the appeal, or somewhere nearby. The other problem relates to the cost of the tribunal system. The hope was expressed in the money resolution that the savings that would be made in local government from the discontinuation of the appeals procedure would cover the costs of establishing the tribunal system. Without going into detail, I suggest that that is fanciful. Many local authority costs can be subsumed with the general administration. This will be a completely different system. Will the Minister tell us how much it will cost to set up and run successfully the panels, bearing in mind the time limit within which I should like cases to be resolved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was not able to participate in the Welsh part of this interesting debate. If I did not recognise Wales as a nation, there would be severe domestic strife at home, but I readily recognise it as such. I referred to a visit to West Sussex yesterday. As I came back through the Hindhead and Haslemere area, I thought of one of my most treasured possessions, which was given to my family some years ago. It is an early copy of William Cobbett's "Legacy to Landowners" which has the signature of David Lloyd George inside its flyleaf. Perhaps the tribunal will draw on the expertise of Welsh lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to deal with the specific points that have been made. The hon. Member for Warrington, South (Mr. Hall) wondered about the legal basis of what the tribunal would take into account. The tribunal will rule not on the delivery of services in a statement, but on the failure to make one, the failure to alter one or to make an assessment. The failure to provide what is prescribed in the statement will remain a matter for appeal to the Secretary of State. The tribunal must take into account the LEA's statutory responsibilities, including any savings made in the legislation, but it must take into account also the code of practice, which I hope will prove positive in encouraging LEAs to fulfil their duties. The recent Audit Commission report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is reasonable to conclude that the lack of priority given to the process by LEAs is the main cause of delay".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1181</span>
The first point that the hon. Member for Cambridge made about resources reflects a general anxiety. Since 1979, we have increased expenditure on children in special schools by 30 per cent. in real terms, notwithstanding the decline in the number of pupils. Pupils in ordinary schools, including those who have special needs and are now in the mainstream, have benefited from a real-terms increase in spending of 40 per cent. per pupil.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Education (No. 2) Act 1986, and the Education Reform Act 1988, the number of requests for statementing has increased to between 50 and 60 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that. An interesting issue that we cannot resolve today is whether the increase in traffic—that is, the number of people who request statements or wish to appeal—reflects a change in an objective condition or parents' wish to obtain rights that are now available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider the points made by the hon. Members for Bridgend and for Cambridge and my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest about the conduct of the tribunal. I agree with the hon. Member for Bridgend that justice delayed can be justice denied. That is especially true when dealing with vulnerable, worried people, who are not used to tribunals and lawyers. We do not wish the tribunal system to cause delay or a backlog. We estimate the annual cost of setting up a tribunal at £1 million a year. Unlike the social security system, we shall benefit from a one-tier system. The tribunal will have strict time targets. I shall personally ensure that those targets are achieved. Some cases will be complex and there will be a delay in their resolution because they must be considered fully. However, we intend to get on with the job and not allow delays to frustrate justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main theme of our short and useful debate was anxiety about the over-legalistic nature of the tribunal. I sympathise with the points that have been made. I speak without direct experience of the law courts, but I remind the Committee that provisions exist for a less formal and daunting procedure—for example, judges sitting in chambers. The Chairman in a tribunal will not wear a wig and other members will not wear gowns. I do not wish to give the impression that the tribunals are unnecessarily adversarial. It is difficult to exclude the process of law. The provisions are set out in statute; the statement is a formal and precise document that is subject to interpretation. There must be a system of appeal. Appeals on points of law go to the High Court. We cannot get away from lawyers. We need a structure that—with respect to members of the Committee who have qualifications in law—keeps lawyers in their place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been put in my place. I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister's comments. The tribunal should develop an atmosphere of sensitivity and informality, which will make it more accessible. It is very important that the tribunal should not become adversarial. The chairman of the tribunal should work to keep the tribunal informal and as sensitive as possible to cases so that justice may be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful intervention. Sometimes I am worried about receiving support from lawyers when I seem to be running them down, but my hon. Friend's expertise is valuable. We should remember that the Lord Chancellor, when he appoints people to the important post of chairman, will have regard to the sensitivities of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1182</span>
young and vulnerable human lives with which they will deal. I hope that the chairmen will be able to behave in a sensible and friendly manner and that they will conduct the tribunal's proceedings accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press my hon. Friend the Minister on this matter, but it is one thing to have valid and rigorous legal advice, and quite another to insist that a legally qualified person should preside over the tribunal. The latter does not follow from the former, and I hope that my hon. Friend will clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot help my hon. Friend by changing the clause. The tribunal structure was set out in the consultation document and received substantial support. I think that my hon. Friend has in mind that a legally qualified clerk might sit alongside a lay panel with a lay chairman. That struicture has not been adopted in the Bill because it is expected that the tribunal will be staffed by officers of the Department for Education, who will run its administrative affairs. The chairman would be responsible for his own legal advice, so there would not be two tiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend also mentioned expenses. Some of the points can be dealt with more appropriately under clause 159, but I can say that we are open to representations on the matter. We intend to pay parents' travel expenses, but the inclusion of other matters will be considered and we are open to representations about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has to be a legal structure. It is designed to be friendly to parents and suitable for the swift prosecution of justice. Much good will has been expressed in the Committee, and I am sure that what has been said this morning will be reflected by my officials when they develop proposals for the regulations and when the tribunal is established next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our debate on clause 157, reference was made to clause 158(1), which deals with the qualifications for the president and members of the chairmen's panel.
