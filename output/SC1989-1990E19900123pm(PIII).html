	<p>[Continuation from col.420]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 318, in page 5, line 46, leave out "ownership and".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are to be NHS trusts, as outlined in the Bill, which will be charged with the management of hospitals, that should remain distinct and separate from ownership of hospitals. We have been told again that hospitals will not be opted-out of the NHS but will remain very much a part of the NHS. If that is true, I cannot understand why the Government are hostile to the amendment, which would simply confirm that the ownership of hospitals and related land or buildings would remain firmly under the auspices of the NHS and could not be disposed of by hospital trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard all the factors that are supposed to be part of self-governing hospitals, and phrases such as corporate spirit, rewarding excellence and managing staff, but none of those is dependent on the ownership of land. Ownership implies the right to sell and to dispose of assets, the proceeds of which would presumably go to improving the work of the self-governing hospital, but the land was probably bought and paid for by the DHA with money that could otherwise have been used for the whole community. Therefore, resources raised from sales should surely go towards improving the health care of local people, and not just to providing resources for specialised treatment, which may have far less immediate relevance to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should have powers to prevent a sale, but the self-governing hospital trust should have to justify to the relevant health authority its decision to dispose of assets. There is a deep suspicion that the words "ownership and", standing alongside the management function of the hospital in the clause, could lead to asset-stripping and the longer-term posibility of privatisation. People will be anxious and will ask why the provision is in the Bill, as it does not appear to be central or necessary to the management of a hospital trust. I hope that the Minister will reasssure us on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power to own, acquire or dispose of assets is one of the key freedoms for NHS trusts. The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) about the 100 or so properties in the region that were not being put to good effect for the best interests of patient care spells out why it is important for the NHS trusts to have control over their assets. We made clear in the initial guide for self-governing hospitals that NHS trusts would be required to notify
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
the Secretary of State of intended sales of assets worth more than £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) that the Secretary of State will have a reserve power to intervene if he considers that the disposal of assets above a specific value is against the public interest. We do not wish to circumscribe the NHS trusts in the way suggested in the hon. Gentleman's amendment. One of the criteria that we have spelt out is that before an NHS trust can be established, it must show a capacity to run its own affairs and must have a good management system in place. That will encourage NHS trusts to make the best possible use of their facilities to provide high quality health care. I hope that members of the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remain sceptical about the provision, which will cause considerable politcal controversy. However, we cannot resolve the problem at this time of night, so beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 319, in page 5, line 46, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or other establishments or facilities".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 320, in page 5, line 48, after "authorities", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes for which those authorities previously managed them".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 321, in page 5, line 49, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or other establishments or facilities".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed to give the Minister an opportunity to elaborate on what sort of facility the Government regard as suitable to opt out. The original plan was to allow only 250 hospital beds to opt out but, presumably for political reasons and to ensure that there was a longer list for those who expressed interest in the measure, the scope for opting out has become wider. The hon. Member for Mid Kent (Mr. Rowe) said earlier that there was considerable scope for different units or facilities within the NHS to become self governing in due course. If that is the Government's plan, it is wider than the popular impression that the provision will apply only to hospitals. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain what the Government envisage and how they want the trend to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People should be aware that the Government may be thinking of a regional or local district general hospital as being a potential candidate for opting out. It is clear that Ministers are actively considering, and are being encouraged to do so by Conservative Back Benchers, whether other types of facilities should be covered by the provision. It would be helpful if the Minister could outline the Government's thinking, because concern has been expressed from several quarters about other NHS facilities that may be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment would undermine the purpose of the NHS trusts, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
is that they should be able to manage their services flexibly and, if necessary, develop new services. If implemented, the requirement in the amendment that hospitals should be managed only for purposes for which they were managed previously would ossify the provision of services. Interest has been expressed in the trusts by 22 community units and three ambulance services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NHS trusts should be given the opportunity to have greater control over employment patterns and management structures. That will be a force for good. Several establishments have expressed their wish to operate community services which, on many occasions, have been overlooked within the Health Service. They believe that it will be possible to provide a more flexible and effective service within the NHS trust structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's argument carefully. Will she confirm that the Government do not intend to allow blood transfusion services to become self governing trusts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that no interest in self governing trusts has been expressed by blood transfusion service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A blood transfusion service in my region has expressed interest in becoming a self governing trust. The Minister turned down the application. I believe that it was the only application to become a self governing trust that was turned down. Was that a decision of incident or of principle? Will there be a decision of principle that blood transfusion services will not be allowed to become self governing trusts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No category will be ruled out, and each case will be considered on its merits. Once again, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) has shown his complete misunderstanding of the purpose of the NHS trust. It remains within the NHS and is a matter of units being able to manage more effectively and efficiently to provide high standards of patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made clear the range of units that are coming forward and those that may be able to apply for NHS trust status. Some of the units for the mentally handicapped and those providing other services in the community have good ground for believing that, under the greater flexibility and autonomy that the new status would confer on them, they will be able to provide even higher standards and quality of care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cousins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I want to place on record my absolute amazement and horror that the Minister should have opened the door to the possibility of blood transfusion services as self-governing trusts. I had hoped that the decision taken in regard to the northern region blood transfusion service would have made it clear that at no stage would such a service be considered for self-governing trust status. Tonight, that evidence has not been accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is showing again that he has failed to appreciate the purpose of the NHS trust. The whole point is to determine what will provide the best quality of care for patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an excellent blood transfusion service and I am sure that every hon. Member has had good reason to be grateful to it at some stage in his or her life. The Government have spent unprecedented amounts on the NHS and we, of all Governments, have a right and duty to consider how we may best ensure that those vast sums are put to best effect for patient care. That is the nub of all our proposals not only for NHS trusts but throughout the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister to the extent that she has made it clear to many Opposition Members that the campaigning opportunities that will arise from the provisions of the Bill will be even more extensive than those from which we have already reaped some political return. I should be grateful to the hon. Lady for that, but the overall implications of what she said remain rather worrying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Dame Janet. I believe that the Committee should spend time tonight in considering amendment No. 311 to schedule 2 as it relates to the important issue of research and training. That' is a matter of considerable interest to lobby organisations outside the Committee, one of whose representatives has been waiting patiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that, we do not propose to move any of the amendments to clause 5 standing in my names and those of my hon. Friends. After a formal debate and vote on clause 5 stand part, I hope that it will be possible to move to schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). Does he wish to speak to any of them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that only amendment No. 325 is left. Dame Janet. No, I do not wish to speak to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, we come to clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly on a matter that concerns the constituency to which the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) referred. Subsection (8) poses a problem for the Hammersmith hospital, which serves my constituency and the Royal Postgraduate medical school. Under subsection (8), someone who is an employee of a university cannot be an employee of a trust. That has implications for the RPMS, because if it decides to become self-governing, the medical director of a trust will be excluded from being the director of the NHS trust. Hammersmith is the only model that has adopted the structure that I have described, but other medical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
schools are moving towards the Hammersmith model, and such a restriction may affect others in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not ask for an immediate response, because my hon. Friend the Minister may not be aware of the problem, that affects the RPMS, but I assure her that universities are unhappy about this restriction. It will reduce their influence on a trust that looks after the interests of both the university and the Health Service. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will see if there is a way round the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I will come back to my hon. Friend on this matter, because I appreciate the importance of dealing adequately with the various interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) came uncharacteristically ill-prepared to the Committee—ill-prepared, indeed, to conduct the Committee's business at all—as he seems to be under the illusion that the nationalisation of hospitals in 1948, which the clause is in many respects reversing, was included in the 1945 Labour party manifesto. That is simply not true. The 1945 Labour party manifesto committed the Labour Government to the introduction of a National Health Service, but the electorate at the time had every reason to suppose that the National Health Service that was to be introduced would be that conceived, not by the Labour party but by the coalition Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that the hon. Gentleman is in full flood, but he should resume his seat when I rise to my feet. I do so to assist him, because there is too much noise in the Committee, and it was difficult for me to hear him, even with his fairly powerful voice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is surprising that the hon. Member for Livingston, who leads for the Opposition in the Committee, should either be so ignorant of the historical record or—far worse—disguise it to make a cheap political debating point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction between the Labour party manifesto of 1945 and the Conservative Minister of Health's White Paper which conceived the National Health Service on one side, and the Labour party's 1948 Act on the other, is crucial if we are to understand the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nationalisation of the hospitals departed from the all-party consensus that had been built up in the coalition Government. In my view it was an extremely regrettable departure from the original concept of the NHS, and no words could be too superlative to praise the Government who finally redress the ill that the Labour party introduced into the system. The ill was, of course, that the nationalisation of the hospitals created a structure that was fundamentally bureaucratic and elitist. The great and the good at DHA level disposed of all hospital resources and simply decided whether to spend money on intensive care—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Dame Janet. Maybe I have missed something, but what has all this drivel to do with this clause . . stand part debate? It has nothing whatever to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Liberal party could do with a short lesson on the background to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
The nationalisation of the hospitals produced a monopoly that could not possibly be patient-oriented or consumer-oriented—it could only be producer-oriented. It contained all the seeds of management complacency and wastefulness in the use of resources which have indeed been the great shortcomings of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Livingston let the cat out of the bag when he said that one effect of introducing NHS trusts might be to break the present system of national pay determination. If ever there was a sign of producer-orientation in a service, of a service being run for the convenience—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> I am sorry but I cannot give way because I do not have time. If ever there was a sign of something being run for the convenience of those within it, on inefficient and uneconomic principles, it is national pay determination. The given level of pay is almost by definition bound to be too high in certain areas—so the resources will be wasted—and too low in others so that labour shortages will occur. That is a crazy system. The hon. Member for Livingston spuriously alleged that Labour party members are not concerned with democratic elections, because they did not introduce them with the fundamental change in 1948. They are concerned with the preservation of selfish, organised, unionised privileges and the protection of a bureaucratic, monopolistic and monolithic structure which we have had in the present service, and which I hope that the clause will help to sweep away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may recall, Dame Janet, that you curtailed my earlier contribution on amendments for understandable reasons. Perhaps I can further develop my argument here on clause stand part. I was discussing the attitude of boards of directors, and indeed of the managing director of an opt-out trust to the various bodies with whom the trust might have to deal. I pointed out that major increases in pay would take place as consultants exercised pay clout in the new market conditions, as has happened in the United States of America. I also referred to the tendency to flexibility on consultants' private work, which would arise where trusts sought to attract consultants whom they felt might best serve their images.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trusts will compete for the most able and experienced consultants, driving pay up to extraordinary levels within those trusts if only to further the reputation of the particular opt-out organisation that they may be representing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the attitude of trust directors to district health authorities. The trust will plead commercial confidentiality wherever possible, claiming typically a private-sector defence. Private sector organisations invariably seek to defend information and protect it against coming into the public domain on the basis that it is commercially confidential. Their attitude will be to reveal as little as possible, apart from the most basic information included in contracts and business plans. They will inevitably resist non-profitable services, perhaps by over-pricing and seeking to avoid taking on responsibility for certain contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
They will also lobby for unprofitable services that they do not want to be given elsewhere within a particular district, probably in inadequate facilities. If they do not want to take on that business, their attitude will often be "Let's get that business off our backs because we do not want it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the attitude of trust directors to the private sector generally. I believe that consultants could well manipulate opt-out trust policy on availability of service to ensure that certain operations can only be carried out elsewhere in the United Kingdom. If people want local provision, they will be faced with the option of having to go private and perhaps even of being treated by the same trust consultant. The trust will endeavour to utilise any slack in occupancy by inviting private business with beds for private patients. Consultants will subtly juggle lists to ensure that a number of operations take place on patients in private beds. Therefore, some trust consultants will seek to ensure that certain operations take place only in private beds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the attitude of trust directors to family practitioner service authorities. They will want to negotiate contracts that maximise revenue in conditions of minimum expenditure, and that has major implications for service. The directors' attitude will be to say as little as possible to community health councils, and to hide behind commercial confidentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government clearly intend not to interfere in the question of remuneration within the trusts. Therefore, the directors will probably seek to maximise their own personal remuneration. Trusts, through their families, may develop businesses outside trust enterprises which are able to take advantage of contracts allocated by the trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I lay my views on directors' attitudes on record because when in 1981 we discussed the Transport Bill and the present Secretary of State for Social Services, the then junior Minister in the Department of Transport—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to respond to the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). The Government have spoken at length on the important contribution that NHS trusts can make to patient care. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Secretary of State will have safeguards in the unlikely event that the powers invested in the NHS trusts are abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State or his appointee can alter the terms of a contract, including the prices referred to in it, in the process of arbitration. He can also direct trusts about the contracts into which they enter under the terms of schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 7 is to be amended to ensure that NHS trusts provide community health councils with information. Under schedule 2, paragraph 8, an NHS trust must provide such information to the Secretary of State as he may require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington also mentioned potential abuse, and private patients. The Bill provides that private work should not interfere with trusts' obligations to NHS contracts. The Secretary of State will have a reserve power if the power to provide private patient facilities is abused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Workington that I see NHS trusts working very differently from how he envisages them developing. He will recall that only this morning the Secretary of State spoke of a general practitioner giving an account of how hospitals were taking a new interest in GPs' views of the services provided by hospitals. I know of a potential trust in which those involved have even speculated about using flexibility on pay to curtail consultants' ability to undertake private work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will provide flexibility. NHS trusts will be able to provide health care and develop services as they think best. But the Bill will include the safeguards which, I believe, the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members would wish to be in the Secretary of State's hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Last Thursday a section of the debate, if not specifically Scottish, lent itself to a specifically Scottish discussion between the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland with responsibility for health and me. I referred to a speech made by the principal of Glasgow university, Sir William Kerr Fraser, in which he expressed apprehension about the Bill's provisions and the future of research. The Minister responded and, a little later in the evening, was good enough to pass to me copies of his correspondence with the principal of that university. I wish to pursue the matter a little
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
further, but it appears that the Minister wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that the hon. Gentleman may have seen that Sir William Kerr Fraser whom he commended to the Committee because of his experience as a senior civil servant, made another speech the other day. He lamented the fact that Government regulations were imposing costs on the university and said that those imposing the regulations should take account of costs. The advice to the Committee to take account of his experience in both roles was good advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister feels so. I wish to refer to some further advice which has come to light since our exchanges last week. When I mentioned that the principal of Glasgow university had made a critical speech, the Minister said that I had chosen not to refer, for example, to the principal of Aberdeen university, who had put a slightly different complexion on events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, by courtesy of the good offices of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, I have seen some later correspondence between the principal of Aberdeen university and the Minister. I shall quote from a letter sent to the Minister yesterday by the principal, who said that he was most interested to hear of our exchanges in the Standing Committee on the NHS and Community Care Bill last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do … agree with the Principal of Glasgow that it is of critical importance that statutory provision should be made for University representation as of right on Health Authorities/Boards managing hospitals which provide a major input to undergraduate teaching.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I would be reassured if what the Minister said in summing up were the case, and that the Universities will in fact have statutory right of representation on appropriate Boards/Authorities. The CVCP advice is that this is not the case in the legislation as at present drafted, and I am satisfied it is proper to press for that statutory right to be on the face of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
That was a helpful intervention. It suggests that, on the specific issue on which I wish to concentrate in these amendments, there is perhaps less distance between the principals of Glasgow and Aberdeen than appeared in our exchanges last Thursday. I hope that the Minister can respond constructively to this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, certainly. The Minister was critical of me in a rather friendly way last week for over-quoting what he had said about the principal of Aberdeen university, who said that there was much in the Bill that he welcomed, including the principle. He saw much scope in it. In this latest letter, he confirmed that. I do not deny what he said. I say only that he has expressed concern on this point constructively and clearly.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
seems to be saying to the Under-Secretary of State that he should not be selective between principals and that he should not be selective about the views of one principal alone, even if he is the principal of Aberdeen university.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to spend time at this late hour rehearsing an exchange that we had last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument concentrated on public comments by the principal of Glasgow university. The Minister, rightly and fairly, from his viewpoint, sought to redress the balance by saying that the principal of Aberdeen had not been all that critical. In the light of those exchanges, the principal of Aberdeen has taken the opportunity to say that while the Minister described his position correctly in terms of giving the Bill a fairer wind than the principal of Glasgow would have done, they are much at one on this matter, as they are with the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals generally. I shall concentrate briefly on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important issue underlying the amendments is accountability. To appreciate that, it is important to sketch out how medical education is funded. It involves two Government Departments. Part of the cash comes from the Vote of the Department of Health Vote, via health authorities. It pays for the service element of teaching and, to some extent, research. The service element includes hospital facilities and NHS staff. The other part comes from the Vote of the Department of Education and Science via the Universities Funding Council and is intended to cover clinical academic staff who teach undergradutates and undertake research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed the knock-for-knock system about which Glasgow university's principal expressed anxiety. That is the term used to describe the way in which university clinical teachers and NHS consultants in university teaching hospitals are paid by only one employer while doing work for two. Whether consultants are academic or from the Health Service makes no difference from the patient's viewpoint. In univesity hospitals, some patients are under the care of consultants employed by the NHS who have honorary teaching contracts. This means that they are paid to look after patients but receive no pay for teaching students. Other patients are under the care of university professors such as readers or senior lecturers. They are employed by the university and, in a sort of mirror image, have honorary NHS contracts. They are paid to teach students and undertake research, but do not receive pay for looking after patients. There are two categories plus two votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relationship between universities with medical schools and the NHS is extremely close—indeed, it is inextricably linked. On that basis, it is not surprising that universities are unhappy about what they regard as the inadequacy of having only one representative on the board, which is what the Bill specifies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the universities have a shared responsibility with health authorities and with the NHS trusts that are to be set up under schedule 2, they must have a real share in decision making. The chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, Sir Edward Parkes,
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
has written to the chief executive of the UFC, Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer to that effect. In a letter dated 22 January, he again makes the point strongly that the matter must be redressed. I hope that the Minister can give some assurance that the Government's mind is not fully closed and that perhaps later they can allay the anxiety expressed in university and other academic circles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 313 is essentially a technical, drafting measure. By virture of a Royal charter, a university is the body which will nominate persons to boards. However, the amendment emphasises the continuing need for better understanding by relevant Government Departments of how medical education is structured. It reinforces the criticisms voiced in the Croham report on the University Grants Committee about the lack of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arising from those recommendations, the first joint note of guidance on medical education was issued by the Department of Health and the DES in March 1987: it urged joint consideration of funding issues and better co-ordination. An inter-departmental steering group on undergraduate medical and dental education was set up in November 1987. Despite this, it looks as though there is still some way to go in the sense that the Department responsible for drafting the Bill does not not understand the clear difference between a "a university with a medical school/faculty" and "a medical school". Only "the university" has status constitutionally. The amendment covers a technical matter. None the less, it highlights a point that has been identified as having been historically a problem. Perhaps now is the time for it to be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 314 seeks to ensure that NHS teaching trusts will have a specific duty to support teaching and research rather than merely a power under paragraphs 10, 11 and 12. We have had parallel discussions more than once about writing into the Bill the word "duty" as opposed to the permissive "power". I hope that in this context the Department can respond positively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an NHS trust were to adopt different priorities in the allocating of resources, which it would be able to do under the Bill as drafted, there is potential for serious damage to be inflicted upon medical education and research before the Secretary of State is able to exercise his reserve powers under paragraph 6(1) of the schedule to intervene and take necessary action. All these issues arise from similar basic and highly legitimate anxieties. I hope that the Minister will take them on board and respond by making constructive and helpful proposals later if he cannot do so tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall support briefly the speech of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy). He laid his finger on the genuine problem of the relationship between the universities and the NHS. As he explained, universities have sole responsibility for training our doctors. They also do most of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
research upon which future progress in the NHS depends. To do that, they need access to the NHS—to the hospitals and to their patients. At present, a good relationship and balance exist. Near my constituency is Hammersmith hospital which comes under the aegis of the special health authority, and the Royal Post Graduate Medical School, which is part of the University of London. They work well together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill asks what will happen to the relationship between a university and a health authority if the latter becomes a trust and is therefore required to place contracts and try to obtain value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments suggest that the Bill lacks adequate safeguards to protect the university's interest in research and in training doctors. They stiffen up the Bill and by providing those safeguards. If, for the sake of argument, the Hammersmith special health authority became a trust, its relationship with the University of London would not be adversely affected. The amendments seek to make sure that the presence of the university would be reinforced if such a trust were established. More than one director and member of staff at the university could be employed by the trust. That employment, to which I referred in the clause-stand-part debate, is at present precluded by the Bill. The university would also have the access to the hospital's facilities that it needs to train staff. At the heart of the amendments is the worry that universities will not be able to carry out their role if hospitals go down the contract path too fast and too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end by expressing the real anxiety of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and the dean of the RPMS, who has written to me about the problem. They believe that the Bill places insufficient obligation on a trust to provide the services that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we debated clause 3 last week, I expressed anxieties similar to those that have prompted the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) to table these amendments. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has been able to explore the problem further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the letter to Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, from which the hon. Gentleman has already quoted, is dated 22 January. It is therefore highly topical and recent, and was written after last week's debate. The first paragraph of the letter states that discussions in which the CVCP has so far been involved give little confidence that the CVCP's concerns are being seriously addressed. Whatever opinion the Committee holds about the assurances that we were given last week, it is clear that we have not removed the anxiety of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. At present the NHS is a unified organisation that shares the public service ethos with other organisations. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) touched on the basic problem, which is that the Bill would fragment the NHS. It would require the fragments to operate independently of each other and of the other public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to develop that point of principle at length. If we accept that the Government believe that that would be in the interests of better local business
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
management in the NHS, it behoves them to provide protection for some of the consequences of fragmentation. One essential protection that must be provided is the preservation of the present integration of the university medical faculties with the major hospitals. That relationship predates the NHS and ought to continue after the enactment of the Bill, if that is to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Ministers will respond positively. The formulation of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye may not be entirely correct, just as last week our formulation was not exact. However, some formulation must be possible that will be acceptable to Ministers if they are to recognise the depths of the anxiety that has been expressed. The people who have written the letters that have been quoted are not the sort of people whom one would normally mobilise in any species of rent-a-lobby or rent-a-protest. They are people of impressive credentials who are very much part of the establishment that deals with Department of Health officials. That they have been obliged to write in such robust terms shows the depth of their anxiety. The Government can respond to this issue without endangering the principle of the legislation—much as I should like that principle to be endangered—and I hope that they will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those in universities and medical schools have raised legitimate and genuine worries. The all-party contribution to this brief debate shows that those views are shared by all who have spoken. The Government will respond carefully and flexibly. Our minds are not closed on some of the finer details of the relationship between NHS hospitals and universities or on the definitions of the constituencies from which representatives will be drawn to sit on the boards of trusts. I admit that we must do more work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three brief points. First, I have given a commitment that the Government will go beyond funding the excess cost of teaching and research and consider funding also the excess costs involved in some non-teaching hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in reply to the amendment of the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy), I am not persuaded that two formal representatives need to be on an 11-man board of an NHS trust hospital—six will be non-executives. Schedule 2 permits one member to be drawn from a medical school, university, or dental school—whichever is appropriate for the particular trust. We do not rule out a second or third appointment of individuals on their own merits who would not be formal representatives but have close connections with the university or school. That would allow the legitimate voice of the university or the school to be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, amendment No. 314 deals with making facilities available. NHS trust hospitals must make sensible provision for access by university teaching staff. As the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye knows, schedule 2 gives power to the trusts to do that. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) referred to the Secretary of State's reserve powers to intervene specifically if those facilities are not being made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
We shall proceed cautiously in considering the disaggregation of costs between hospitals and universities. Knock for knock has worked well. A trial study in Southampton is examining how we can separate the costs and charge them fairly, but we shall move cautiously and slowly because we do not want to disturb the fruitful co-operation between hospitals and universities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moved on to the final point about knock for knock, he mentioned the Secretary of State's reserve power, which can be invoked when a trust does not give due accord to the needs of medical research. I want the Minister to consider the point that I made in moving the amendment. Given the nature of the work involved, there is a genuine worry that that reserve power could not be invoked in time to prevent damage to medical research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the anxiety. The RHAs have the responsibility to ensure that DHAs and the NHS trust hospitals in their regions to meet their obligations. The Secretary of State will rely on sound intelligence from the regions, so I do not share the hon. Gentleman's gloomy prediction about some NHS trusts. I hope that, with the assurances I have given him, he will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not press the amendment. "Assurances" is slightly too strong a word to sum up the Minister's response, but he has at least admitted some difficulties. As he has stressed the need for flexibility and for the Government to adopt a softly-softly approach, I hope that he will not rule out bringing forward proposals for provisions along the lines of my amendment, if he thinks that they are necessary. I notice the Minister nodding assent, so I shall not push the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) said, the calibre of people involved would not rush into print unless they were genuinely worried. There must be further discussions between Department officials, Ministers and universities to try to allay those fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 245, in page 55, line 37, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(dd) the requirements as to expertise or experience of executive and non-executive directors where the trust is responsible for services to persons of a specified description."</p></blockquote>
I sense that the Minister is in a reflective and accommodating mood at this late hour. Perhaps we can tempt him to give us other assurances that would go some way to meeting our worries about the appointment of directors to the National Health Service trust hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require that an order establishing a trust must state the special qualifications that would be expected of some directors of the trust for dealing with services for special groups. I want to refer specifically to the interests of people with a mental handicap who are in hospital or in the community. Hon. Members with experience of and interest in men-
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
tally handicapped people will be aware that it is all too easy for the glamour of the acute sector to win the competition for resources between services in hospitals. It is not always easy to prove that resources which should have been allocated to the mental handicap service have moved across the acute sector, but it happens too often to be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's initiatives on mental illness are generally welcomed. However, there is a danger that they will push the mental handicap services further down the list of priorities. Senior managers with a joint responsibility for mental illness and mental handicap could shelve the latter to deal with new initiatives on the fomer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers argue that the Government are anxious to make the NHS trusts work for the benefit of those whom they seek to serve. That could happen in the case of mental handicap services; if financial, business and management expertise is coupled with a knowledge of mentally handicapped people, enormous and beneficial changes could be made for a group of ordinary people with special needs. In other words, both business skills and expertise are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowadays we hear constant reference to the concept of normalisation, which might appear to conflict with the case for special knowledge and expertise among directors and staff. However, normalisation is not about making people sink or swim in an alien environment, nor about pretending that people have skills that they lack. It is about providing people with the support that they need to fulfil their lives, and giving them real choices to exercise according to their abilities and interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people with problems embark on a new and challenging experience, they should have the support of an expert who knows how to provide the best assistance. I am sure that all hon. Members will agree with that. The same point applies to people with specific mental handicaps. If overall strategies, operational policies and individual care plans are devised and followed through by people who are unfamiliar with the realities of mental handicap, then trusts will unfortunately preside over disasters as bad as those of the past. Local authorities with increased responsibility for the provision of community care will need to collaborate with the Health Service to develop services with at least equivalent expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the Minister in the spirit in which it is moved and ask him for a response that matches the concern felt by many Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->

give him two brief assurances in conclusion. It is difficult to enshrine the precise expertise required in primary, and sometimes even in secondary, legislation. I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's sentiments about mental handicap provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the selection of applications for NHS trust status let me first assure the hon. Gentleman that the Secretary of State will exercise great care in ensuring that officers associated with the application—especially the executives—have relevant experience and expertise. Secondly, in appointments of non-executive members of trust boards the hon. Gentleman will recall that regional health authorities make two, and the Secretary of State perhaps three, appointments. I assure the hon. Gentleman that when making his appointments the Secretary of State will carefully bear in mind what has been said in Committee. Moreover, he will have sympathy with the general argument about the mental handicap field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will be appointed to the boards for their skills and for what they can offer, but they must have empathy with and understanding of problems related to the difficult area of mental handicap provision. With those

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was almost right, because I felt that the Minister was in an accommodating mood. I thought that the way in which I moved the amendment would persuade him to accept it—and he almost did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, I am reassured by the Minister's response to the debate. Those who have an interest in the matter will read his word intently, but the proof of the pudding will be in the appointments made, which we shall scrutinise with care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
