	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i> That the amendments be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also considering the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 31, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>";provided that with respect to any agreements entered into on behalf of the Crown relating to pipelines and storage installations the Agency shall consult and receive the approval of the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Energy before entering any such agreements."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 32, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"; provided that in carrying out on behalf of the Crown activities with respect to pipelines and storage installations the Agency shall prepare and publish separate accounts for these activities.'</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our previous sitting, I described the evolution and development of the pipeline and storage system. I stressed that its origin and early development had been based on the nation's need for strategic reserves. That was one of the fundamental functions and roles of the pipeline and storage system. I explained, too, that during the development of the system, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, in addition to the fundamental strategic role of more than 1,000 miles of pipeline and 30 storage tanks, there was a commercial aspect which no doubt helped to finance the strategic and national needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons why we have debated this issue at some length. First, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) has tabled an amendment to take away from the new agency the responsibility for managing the pipeline and storage system. The second and very important reason lies in the revelation by the Minister of State during the sittings motion debate that the Government had seriously considered ways of privatising this strategic pipeline and storage system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. H. H. Skeet 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bedfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who were present will know that I have already given some reasons why that should not be done, and I shall give others. In any case, it is surely for the Minister to tell us why not, because the Government decided, following a
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
PA Management Consultants' report, and an interdepartmental report which hon. Members had not even heard of until the sittings motion debate, to turn their backs on privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the main reason why privatisation did not proceed was that the Ministry of Defence opposed it—or at least challenged the thinking of the Department of Energy. Secondly, I more than suspect—again, it is for the Minister to provide the answer to the interjection of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet)—that not only did the Ministry of Defence have a view on the matter, but so did the United States authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pursue the hon. Gentleman's argument, surely if, as he says, here is a strategic content, why should not the Ministry of Defence own the whole line, so that it would not be the concern of the new agency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North, because his interventions are usually constructive, as in this case. I shall come to the option of transferring the system back to the Ministry of Defence and I shall say why I do not believe that that would make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I come back to why the pipeline is not to be privatised. We oppose that—that is not exactly unexpected—but in he end the Government concluded that it was not a suitable case for privatisation. I surmise that one reason was that the Ministry of Defence made representations—perhaps even blocked the decision to privatise—because of the strategic importance that it attaches to the pipeline system, and I was about to explain why I suspect that there was probably an additional representation by the United States authoriies. As I said, the pipeline was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to meet the needs of the United States air force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the United States authorities ever make representations? Were they consulted or did they give a view about the proposed privatisation to the Department of Energy or to Ministers? The USAF certainly would have had an interest in the future management and ownership of the pipelines and storage system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Southgate rightly said, this important debate is an attempt to try to find out more about the system itself, its organisation and the arrangements that goven its operational and management processes. As the USAF uses the pipeline, or has connections with it for strategic reasons, on what basis are those arrangements made? I assume, from my Foreign Office days, that they are made on a country-to-country basis—the only basis that could operate where another Government, other authorities and particularly the military authoritiese of another Government are involved. I should like to know how privatisation could have or would have influenced those arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the interjection of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North, " Why not? ", it seems to me that both the Ministry of Defence and the United States authorities have strong views about the future of the system, for their own strategic reasons. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
led us to conclude—and that is why we tabled the first of our two amendments—that the strategic pipeline storage system is not safe entirely in the hands of the Department of Energy. Obviously, it has already looked at concepts of privatisation, so amendment No. 31 suggests that any agreement that the agency may sign as the manager of the pipeline—at present the responsibility of the Department of Energy—should be jointly cleared, and that the Secretary of State for Defence should have a say in the activities and the development of the pipeline. In new clause 2 we have inserted a role for the Secretary of State for Defence, as well as for the Secretary of State for Energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our amendment No. 31 is to ensure that all agreements are cleared not only by the Department of Energy but by the Ministry of Defence, as we do not believe that that strategic system is safe entirely in the hands of the Department of Energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Southgate. They relate in particular to our amendment No. 32, dealing with the preparation and publication of the accounts of the pipelines and storage system. What is the position? The hon. Member for Southgate opened the debate by quoting page 9 of the BNOC report and accounts for 1984 which states:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>" Overall utilisation of the system has increased slightly over 1983, for both commercial and other usage, and a number of proposals for handling additional volumes are under active review."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman said that those words often concealed inefficiency and under-utilisation, and that —I believe that I am paraphrasing him reasonably accurately—he suspected that it was a form of words to cover up the lack of efficiency or lack of full management and utilisation of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 9 of the 1984 BNOC report there is a descripton of the
	<br><blockquote><p>" major programme of pipeline inspection ','</p></blockquote>
the
	<br><blockquote><p>" rolling programme to modernise the telecommunication system ".</p></blockquote>
and the development of the new mainline pumps. All those matters are in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to know more about utilisation of the pipeline, not only in the terms specified by the hon. Member for Southgate, but in respect of percentages of use. The hon. Gentleman made a point which was pertinent to any discussion about privatisation. Will the Minister tell us the ratio between the military strategic requirement for the pipeline and its commercial use? I do not believe that such information is a state secret or that, if disclosed, it would endanger national security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southgate surmised that the figures for strategic need was less than 50 per cent. I should have thought that it would be even lower than that if calculated on a week-to-week basis, —perhaps I am plucking figures out the air—only 25 or 30 per cent. The quality of the strategic reserve is not dependent on utilisation, but on avail-
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
ability at times of crisis. By its very nature, therefore, the figures would not be calculated on a regular day-to-day basis. I hope that the Minister will explain the ratio between military and commercial usage and the overall percentage of utilisatian of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another pertinent question to ask which relates to the reason for our tabling amendment No. 32 and concerns the right to see published accounts for the system. Who pays for the system? According to the published documents to which we have access, I assume that the storage of oil would be on a simple rental basis. Most of the system is operated by the oil companies on behalf of the Department of Energy and the oil corporation, and presumably that arrangement will continue under the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the documentation the pipeline will presumably be financed on a cost plus basis—the basic cost plus the management fee or the additional cost involved in undertaking those matters on behalf of the pipeline users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am making a supposition when I say that the storage system will be based on a rental basis, and I hope that the Minister will clarify the position. The pipeline will presumably be on a cost plus basis, although, when we come to debate our new clause, we will discuss our suggestion for a different basis for charging for use of the pipeline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to discover whether a profit and loss account existed for the pipeline and storage system. As the system belongs to the Department of Energy, I examined the Department's Appropriation and Estimates to obtain some information about the cost and receipts of the pipeline. I hope that the Minister will expand on that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I examined the Supply Estimates for 1985–86, in particular the class IV section covering industry, energy, trade and employment. On page 27 of the Estimates, there is a set of figures which we could consider as the basis for the arrangements for the pipeline and storage system. I shall share these with the Committee because they are the nearest thing we have to a system of accounting. If anyone knows of a better one, I am happy to be educated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only accounting system that I can find is relevant to amendment No. 32, which calls for a proper set of accounts to be prepared and published. It is the Department of Energy Vote. Page 27 of the 1985–86 Supply Estimates includes figures for
	<br><blockquote><p>" G5 Government oil pipeline and storage system: capital expenditure, G6 Government oil pipeline and storage system: operation and maintenance"</p></blockquote>
and:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Deduct: GZ Appropriations in aid ".</p></blockquote>
Those are receipts from the operations of the oil pipeline and storage system, which fall under the heading " GZ(1) ". Fortunately there are also figures for 1983–84, 1984–85 and the estimate for 1985–86. I have examined the figures and I shall share with the Committee my conclusion about the financial operations for the past two years and the estimates for the current financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
In 1983, the pipeline and storage system had a capital expenditure of £3.648 million. The maintenance and repair of the system cost £11.379 million, but receipts totalled between £18 million and £19 million—I was not sure which figure to take. If capital expenditure and maintenance and repair costs are deducted from receipts, there is an operating profit, or at least a margin between expenditure and receipts, of £4 million. I do not know whether it was a good return and I shall return to that aspect later. It is the nearest calculation one can find for accounts for 1983–84.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1984–85, capital expenditure was £4.431 million, maintenance and repair costs were just over £14 million and receipts were £19.566 million, giving a surplus of a little more than £1 million. For 1985–86, capital expenditure is estimated at £2.621 million, maintenance and repair costs at £15.129 million and receipts at £20.121 million, leaving a margin of about £3 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the most accurate figures I can produce to suggest what a balance sheet and accounts would look like. I realise that there are missing ingredients and that is why we tabled amendment No. 32, which calls for such accounts to be prepared and published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to know who pays for the system. The question of where the receipts come from has a bearing on privatisation. Surely he who pays should have a say in the show. I shall ask the Minister some direct, simple questions for direct, simple answers. Why pays for the system? What percentage of those receipts was paid by the commercial sector? What percentage was paid by the Ministry of Defence and what percentage was paid by the USAF and the United States authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the commercial side exceed the state side? Do the receipts of the state plus those of the USAF and the United States authorities exceed the commercial side or are they less than the total receipts for the use of the pipeline and storage system? It does not damage any strategic information or state secrets if the Committee is told the ratio of receipts received for the utilisation of the pipeline and storage system. What percentage comes from commercial sources? What percentage comes from Ministry of Defence sources and what percentage comes from the USAF?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oh page 11 of the BNOC report it is stated that the management of both royalty-in-kind oil and the pipeline and storage system adds up to £2.2 million. We are left relatively in the dark about what the management costs of the agency will be: that is, if the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Southgate is not accepted. All we know about the management costs that the agency will be able to charge is that together with royalty-in-kind oil, BNOC collected management fees of £2.2 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much information that the Minister should give us to help our consideration of these amendments, particularly our consideration of the provision in the Bill to transfer the oil pipelines and storage function to the agency. The Opposition will certainly vote against the amendment proposed by the hon. Members for Southgate and for Bedford-
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
shire, North. We reject it utterly because it is a paving amendment to proceed to a form of privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe, that there should be some joint responsibility for the Ministry of Defence. We cannot trust the Department of Energy to maintain entirely the strategic pipeline system. However, to answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North in his intervention, we do not support its transfer to the Ministry of Defence. There is a good balance here between public and commercial needs. The Ministry of Defence is not the most commercially-minded of bodies. It does not have the necessary relationships with the oil companies, some of which operate the system while others use it. It should quite properly become the responsibility of the agency just as it was a sensible responsibility for BNOC to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been looking back through some of the old Appropriation, Supply and Estimates accounts and I have concluded that since taking over the management of the system, BNOC has improved it. It has been more effective financially. The combined task of maintaining the basic strategic reserve and developing the commercial potential of the system has been well managed by BNOC. We bitterly oppose and regret the destruction of BNOC. However, the right place for the system is under the new agency which will have contacts with the oil industry and working relationships with those who use it commercially. For that reason, we shall vote against the amendment of the hon. Members for Southgate and for Bedfordshire, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partly for strategic reasons And partly for commercial reasons which we shall develop on new clause 2, we believe that the agency should be given the opportunity to fill this national need and that the system should not, like so many of our assets, be privatised. We shall therefore reject the amendments and support the transfer of these functions to the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time our amendment No. 31 seeks to ensure that the Ministry of Defence keeps a watching brief on the Department of Energy, and amendment No. 32 would ensure that the accounts of the system were readily available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come later to our new clause 2 and explain why we feel that the system could be expanded for public and commercial benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question that I put to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) in an intervention was a trap and I am afraid that he fell right into it. He said that at the initial stages there would be an option to transfer to the Secretary of State for Defence and that he liked that. Later he went back on that option and suggested that it would not be appropriate. If the system were to go to the Ministry of Defence, there would be nothing left for the agency to administer, except the royalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not recall ever arguing the case for the system to be transferred to the Ministry of Defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned that as a possible option. He can read the record and he will see that he moved from suggesting that as an option to opposing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the agency will have nothing to administer—like a knife without a handle or a blade?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider some of the functions of the agency. The marketing of crude oil and petroleum products is dormant; the disposal of royalty oil has been retained; the operation of pipeline facilities and depots has been retained; the marketing for small companies has been discontinued and the marketing of liquefied petroleum gas discontinued; the custody of participation agreements has been retained—but that could be retained by the Department of Energy anyhow, so there is no need for the agency—and the pricing of crude oil has been discontinued. That brings us to an extraordinary situation: the system could suitably be placed in the hands of the Ministry of Defence, which has a strategic interest in it. But the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney would be against that proposal, as he wants the agency to have something to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1984 BNOC report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>" This amount "—</p></blockquote>
the gross profits—
	<br><blockquote><p>" includes total fees of £2.2 million received for marketing royalty oil on behalf of the Secretary of State for Energy and for managing the Government's Land Pipelines and Storage System."</p></blockquote>
That cannot have left much money for the arrangement of the pipelines and the operation of the depots, but of course they are dealt with by the companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney went on to suggest that there is one strong reason for the privatisation proposal not having been accepted—the Americans must have objected. But in the United States most pipelines are run under common carriers, by the oil companies. That co-operative system works extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided that assurances are obtained from the oil companies, I would not foresee any difficulties if the entire network were to be run by the companies. After all, they are the great commercial users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked about utilisation. That is a sensitive area, and if he accepts the strategic content, he must see that it would be impossible for the Minister to disclose any clue about the percentages of defence and commercial usages respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred to the figures for 1983 to 1986 and said that he who pays should have an interest in the show. Let us see how it came into operation and find out who pays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 1,000 miles of pipeline. They go from Blackford in north Wales across to Rawcliffe and
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
then south to the Isle of Grain and across to Avonmouth. It is a useful network of pipelines with spurs off to defence establishments and commercial depots. The Department of Energy owns them all, largely because they were built before or during the war. The land was acquired in the name of the Crown and the establishments predate the 1962 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the interesting aspect is not who owns the pipelines or the network, but BNOC's responsibility for them. BNOC is simply the managing agent—a useless body in the centre. The main operating and engineering agencies are the contractors, who are under contract to the Department of Energy and the Ministry of Defence. More than 95 per cent. of the pipelines are operated by the British Pipeline Agency Limited, which is a joint holding company owned by Shell UK and BP. That set-up has been working very satisfactorily for years. I assume that the main cost of running the operation is borne by the contractors, as they have to shift their road oil through it. They have been negotiating with the Department of Energy and the Ministry of Defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael J. Martin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Springburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tells us that he assumes that the contractors are mainly responsible for running the pipelines. If he knows all the facts, why does he not tell the Committee the costs? Opposition Members are sick and tired of Conservative Governments giving throwaway deals to private contractors at the expense of the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the observation made by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney who mentioned that he who pays should have an interest in the show. These commercial gentlemen do not appear to have that real interest in the show, but they have to pay for the operation of the lines. They are the main operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: What else can one expect from Opposition Members? They get rather enthusiastic over such matters, but I am prepared to take them on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that it is a fair and reasonable conclusion that the commercial operators should have a say in the show. I see no reason why the operation should not be privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The degree of utilisation—the percentage for strategic purposes—is a sensitive area. I cannot see why the Minister should be put into an embarrassing position by having to declare to the Committee and to the world at large defence information that must remain secret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has posed a number of questions in his search for information and the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) has made some assumptions.

Would it be appropriate for the Committee to adjourn, Mr. Knox, to enable the Minister to get the information so that we can study it? The information may mean that some of the amendments that have been tabled could be withdrawn. I do not like assumptions. If the facts are state secrets and cannot be given to the Committee, perhaps we should adjourn to allow the Minister to obtain the information that would give us a better understanding of the subject. I am sure that the hon. Member would agree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Gentleman was making a point of order. If he is asking me to adjourn the Committee, I am afraid that I am not willing to do so.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give, way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not. I shall carry on with my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. The matter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. Redmond) referred is very serious. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) seemed to suggest that the Opposition were being reckless about the national interest and were not adequately concerned about national security. We have asked a number of questions—to which the hon. Gentleman appears to think that he knows the answers—and we shall ask more. As national security may be related to those questions and the Minister may not wish to answer them in full, he should advise us now about the security implications before we go any further and before any more unpleasant implications are made by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North. We certainly do not wish to breach national strategic interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member knows perfectly well that that is not a point of order. The Opposition have already had pleny of opportunity to make speeches. I called Mr. Skeet and he is entitled to be heard, as was the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhynmey (Mr. Rowlands).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say to the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy), " If the cap fits, wear it." If the implication is that the Opposition are not as assiduous as they should be in the interests of defence, that is up to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defence argument is important. There is a needles network in Europe which is operated under NATO. It is owned by a Department equivalent to our Ministry of Defence and is used by commercial operators. It is an excellent precedent for handling pipelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pipelines are the best way of moving oil and taking lorries off the road. It is a cheap operation if used for bulk quantifies and one product can be
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
pushed along the pipeline after another. If the sysem is used as a commercial operation, it becomes strategic in that it is very important for the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other sectors are vital to the public. Food supply and distribution in the United Kingdom are paramount. The country could not survive long without it. Sainsbury, Tesco and the other major food companies all operate in the private sector. That shows that a strategic interest can be left to the private sector, because it is responsible and will respond to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. I have just heard an intervention from the hon. Gentleman which was not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister of State or his ministerial colleague mentioned the importance of this matter. He said that undertakings had been given by the oil companies to cover times of emergency. It is right to elicit the oil companies' views and to ensure that undertakings are secured for times when the country is in difficulty. Therefore, these arrangements could be privatised on the undertakings derived from the oil companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister has any pangs of conscience on the matter, he could refer back to clause 1 of the Energy Act 1976, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The Secretary of State may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply,"—</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the word " supply "—
	<br><blockquote><p>"acquisition or use of … petroleum, natural gas and petroleum products ".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the powers in the 1976 Act would enable the Minister to deal with the supply and movement of oil and petroleum products through pipelines and to do what is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no conceivable reason against privatisation. Appendix 13 of the Brown Book refers to the major offshore pipelines; those on the continental shelf, which is a different feature in a different geographical area, are under the operation of private companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategic lines which derive from the North sea into the United Kingdom are all operated by private companies which are naturally responsive to the Government because they are controlled by the petroleum production regulations, by their own contracts and the generality of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) is right to suggest that the amendment should be accepted. The production pipelines of the EEC and the ethylene pipelines which are distributed on a European network are privately owned and operated, and the production pipelines in the United States covering gas liquids are operated by the companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be unique, largely because of experience over the years. It is considered that our small network, which is commercially important and probably strategically important, should be kept under the agency, which has virtually nothing else to do but look after the network. It sells royalty oil which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
it can easily pass on to contractors to arrange for the sale of their products and get a satisfactory price. I suggest that those functions should be privatised and not retained by the agency. If the worst comes to the worst, they should be transferred to the Ministry of Defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should stress to the Minister the point that I made earlier. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) asked several questions and other hon. Gentlemen, as well as myself, may ask other questions, seeking further information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) seemed at first to be chastising the Opposition for not being conscious or concerned about national security interests. I sought to establish from the Minister what should be properly and publicly discussed, and what we should be well advised to leave alone. As the Minister has not responded, we must assume that all is open for consideration. If he feels that we should not touch on some points, or develop some matters raised by my hon. Friend, he should tell us. Otherwise, we must be acquitted of the charge made by the hon. Gentleman who himself demonstrated, above all, the need for the Minister to give information. The whole of the hon. Gentleman's speech was based on assumptions and a lamentable state of ignorance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made the point that we recognise the importance of the system to our country, we are entitled to ask the Minister to keep the Committee fully informed. I have one or two questions to ask. Reference has been made to a paper presented in Leicester in 1980, which was accompanied by the Department of Energy's map of land pipelines and storages. Can the Minister tell us whether the system has been extended since then, what new capital works have been carried out which might have a marked effect on the system and whether any arrangements—contractual or otherwise—have been made with those operating other pipelines, particularly those to which the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North referred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another question which may be relevant both to the amendment and to the speech of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North. We have already established that the multinational company Conoco has a substantial interest in the system. Indeed, it acquired property in my own country during a period of Labour Government in the 1960s, which shows that the Labour party is not opposed to the concept of the mixed economy. But I wonder whether Conoco, or any other multinational or indeed national oil company, was consulted about the possibility of privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the Government hawk the system around? Did they negotiate with the oil companies with a view to carrying the idea of privatisation further? If they did, what was the response? Have the oil companies made any proposals for privatisation? Or would Conservative Members have them dragged into it kicking and screaming in protest at having
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
to bear what wiser men than the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North surely recognise should be a national responsibility? Did the Department take any steps to privatise the system? Perhaps, as my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney suggested, the oil companies recognise sense rather more clearly than Conservative Members seem to have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it would not constitute a breach of security, I think the Minister is obliged to answer my hon. Friend's question about the American Administration and NATO. Were they consulted? Are NATO and the American. Air Force perhaps possessed of more common sense than the Conservative party? Many of us think that very likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must come clean. Can he assure us that national security considerations are paramount? If we look at the map of the pipelines and see where the spurs are, it is clear that the capacity of NATO to fulfil its strategic implications would be put at the mercy of multinational private oil interests which might not always be owned, or whose ownership might not always be dominated, by America. We have seen the turmoil in the middle east. The middle east still has a great deal of wealth as well as a great deal of insanity. What will happen if the Shi'ite Moslems earn so much from their oil interests that they are able to purchase multinational oil companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that all the pipelines in the middle east—indeed, all the operations there—are state-owned? He is recommending the same arrangements for the United Kingdom. Are not company operations a better idea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is strengthening my argument. The middle east countries boast of their knowledge and their ability to manage their pipeline systems. When our oil is gone—which will happen much sooner that in ought to—their earnings will expand and their capacity to add to their commercial empires will grow. It is an economic possibility that before we know where we arc the ownership of pipelines of massive national importance will have passed to people who do not care about the interests of either this country or Western Europe. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North displays regrettable myopia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Air Force has bases in East Anglia which are of absolute importance to NATO. I know some of those bases, and I know some of their obligations. Apart from the RAF stations in east Anglia there are stations such as Lakenheath, Mildenhall and Bentwaters, which are occupied by the United States Air Force. Are they prepared to have the possession of their essential fuel supplies passed to a private body which may at some time be owned by countries or people outside Europe or even outside the NATO area? We are entitled to ask that question, although we realise that the Minister is entitled not to answer it if national security is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are entitled to pursue the matter that is central to the speech of the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
for Southgate. Perhaps I may quote the speech that he made in Committee on 11 June. He said early on in his remarks that he felt
	<br><blockquote><p>" a sense of relief as we approach this central part of the Bill."</p></blockquote>
We are indeed at the central part of the Bill. This debate is one of the three most important debates that we shall have. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>" The land pipelines and storage system is to some extent shrouded in mystery ".</p></blockquote>
Those veils of mystery need to be lifted if the Committee is to give the issue proper consideration. The hon. Gentleman said that the Minister
	<br><blockquote><p>" should explain why the agency should run it ",</p></blockquote>
and that he should offer his advice and information about
	<br><blockquote><p>" the structure and importance of the system ".—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 11 June 1985; 
	<i>c.</i> 127–8.]</p></blockquote>
We emphasise that. The Minister should give comfort to Opposition Members and embarrass the privatisation lust of Conservative Members by providing the justification for the continuance of the system under the management of the agency. The Minister will accept that what the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate said is important, and he should not be beguiled by the light-hearted and short-sighted frivolity of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the basis of our case lies in the history of the system, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred, and of which I shall remind the Committee. Our argument is very relevant to the 1935 precedent. Before 1935, the system depended on the private sector. The fuel needed by the RAF was provided by the private sector. There was no national involvement. Then in 1935, the Conservatives in power had more wit than Conservative Members in this Committee, because they recognised that the national interest could not be allowed to depend on the private contractual obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The oil companies maintained a stock of 8,000 tons. They assumed that that represented 10 days' operational requirements. In effect, by 1940, it represented scarcely one day. But it was realised in 1935 that the nation could not depend on a private contractual obligation. Obviously, relations should continue to be good, and relations did continue to be good between the Government and the oil companies of the day. I do not believe that the oil companies were particularly hurt by the Government's decision to end their dependence on a private contractual obligation. They continued to co-operate. If the Government emphasised the overriding need for national strategic considerations to apply, I think that the oil companies would accept it without question. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North knows that. It is absurd to suggest that if we do not privatise the nation will be imperilled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to repeat the interesting history lesson that we were given in our last sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree that it was interesting, Mr. Knox. At about this time of year school pupils are revising, for examinations, and when they are revising they have to repeat information that they were given earlier in the term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing, but I see no resemblance between school pupils and members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you were sitting where I am, Mr. Knox, you might have a different perspective. However, I shall accept your advice and resist the temptation to pursue the matter. I shall only say that I am satisfied that when the Air Ministry decided that the contractual obligation should cease to be overriding it had an adequate legislative basis for that decision. It is quite wrong for the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North to suggest that the Government of 1935–36 acted in an unconstitutional or arbitrary manner. That was certainly not the case, and it was a jolly good job that they were able to make that decision, in view of what happened to this country shortly afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1935 and the early 1940s we saw a superbly swift, decisive and vigorous programme of construction of pipelines, storage depots and so on. That was an example of the co-operation between private and public interests at a time of enormous national peril and crisis. It is essential for Britain to have an adequate mixed economy, and it is deplorable that Conservative Members should put us at risk by making it impossible for such an economy to operate. We need both a public and a private sector, and we must have the structures in our business and our society that will allow them to co-operate in the national interest. It is an appalling shame that the present Government are so obsessed by the idea of privatisation that they are prepared
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
to amputate their interest and remove control from a pipeline that is essential to our defence capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have to give the Committee information which, I hope, will teach Conservative Members that at least in some matters, the national interest must take priority over the mere commercial greed to which they are so dreadfully devoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney gave a history lesson. With all respect, Mr. Knox, I believe that he gave it concisely, providing the essential material and avoiding the inessential. If you will not allow me to emphasise my argument by a revisionary approach, I hope that I may advise Conservative Members to read at least that part of my hon. Friend's speech on national interest, which makes our point cogently and clearly. It is central to our questions to the Minister and I trust that replies will be forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the Committee would be grateful if the Minister could deal in full with the negotiations that might have taken place on privatisation. Such a reply would ensure that the strategic interest was properly explained. Will the Minister also address the financial interests to which my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred? It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us the return for the three financial years to which my hon. Friend referred and for the whole period of BNOC's involvement in the agency. We might be able to establish that the average return was the same as the return for the first of the three years that my hon. Friend mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of my hon. Friend's figures, the returns for 1983–84 seem to have been in excess of 20 per cent. One can understand how attractive privatisation is to Conservative Members. They are not interested in the national strategic consideration. They are dominated by the current attachment to profit. It would be interesting for the Minister to give the Committee information which might emphasise that point fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not done a detailed pre-1983 profit and loss account based on the Department of Energy's figures. However, I looked back and my impression was that post-BNOC taking over, the system became more efficient and commercial. There is a good case for maintaining the division as part of BNCC and a supplementary case for transferring it to the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend shares my suspicion that BNOC exercised a good influence on the system and that it may have secured for the public a better return and a more effective arrangement than applied before. Perhaps the Minister will note that point and give the Committee the relevant information. If we knew how profitable the system was and what the return was, we could better assess the intensity of greed of Conservative Members. I trust
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
that the Minister will be able to provide that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like the Minister's estimate—or BNOC's estimate—of the system's effectiveness and profitability after 1986. My hon. Friend could give only estimates for that year, because, as far as we know, that is the only coverage in public documents. There may be relevant forward estimates. If they show growing earnings from the activity, it will add to the frustration of Conservative Members—especially if the Minister has so perceived the overriding need for the national security interest to be maintained that he will have to continue to say no to those of his hon. Friends who wish to privatise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, to me, is the first of the three most important debates on the Bill. We are obliged to the hon. Member for Southgate for tabling amendment No. 36, being considered with two of our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister will share our assessment that the subject of the debate is of vital interest, and I trust that he will be able to provide the detailed information that we require in a proper response to the debate. I hope that the brevity of my remarks will not lead the Minister to feel that the subject can be dispensed with in a light, short manner. We want a great deal of information and we trust that the Minister will supply it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of questions for the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet). He seemed to suggest that the pipelines would be safe in the event of aggression. Was he saying that they would be safe from nuclear attack? I cannot see any pipelines or pumping stations surviving a nuclear attack. Or has the Minister taken steps to ensure that local authorities are implementing the Government's proposals for the safeguarding of certain public interests?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, if the pipelines are so vital to our interests and to national security, why does the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North think that privatising them would make them safer? The hon. Gentleman mentions national security, and talks of Tesco and so on, but what part would such private companies play in a national crisis?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Energy (Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) and for Bedfordshire, North (Mr. Skeet) for tabling the amendment which has given rise to a useful and worthwhile debate. It is right that the Committee should debate the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) was being less than his usual fair self to my hon. Friends the Members for Southgate and for Bedfordshire, North in what he said about their attitude towards the strategic interests of the country. I gathered from what they said that they attach considerable importance to the issue. I was disappointed that the hon. Member for Wentworth spoke as he did about the spirit in which the amendment was moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee owes a debt of gratitude to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney for the teach-in that he provided on pipelines. Clearly he had taken a lot of trouble in his usual assiduous way to prepare his speech and the Committee listened with interest and fascination. His explanation has enabled me to shorten my speech considerably because he answered directly many of the questions posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Southgate in moving his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that the system was set up in preparation for the second world war. It comprises 1,000 miles of pipeline and 41 oil storage facilities. The hon. Gentleman explained that the main part of the system is between the estuaries of the Humber, the Mersey, the Avon and the Thames, but that there are also oil pipeline and storage facilities in east Anglia and spurs to the Isle of Grain and to the Hamble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to reiterate how the system works because it is clear from the debate that there is confusion about the status of the system. I want to make it clear that the system is owned by the Crown and that the Department of Energy is responsible for it. That is why it is financed on the Vote of my Department. BNOC undertakes the very important function of managing the system; it has a management role on a day-to-day basis. My Department has an agency agreement with the BNOC to manage the system. We then move from the management of the system to the operation, which is carried out by private sector operating companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system plays an important strategic role in supplying defence establishments, but it also plays a useful role in the distribution of oil products for purely civilian purposes. My hon. Friends were right to make that point. Indeed, since the end of the second world war, there has been a considerable expansion in civilian use of the pipelines. My hon. Friend the Member for Southgate, was correct to say the commercial side of the pipeline now accounts for the major part of the system in regard to throughput and revenue, but, for the reasons put forward by my hon. Frend the Member for Bedfordshire, North, I am not prepared to go further and give details of the division between the two. [
	<i>Interruption</i>] Hon. members cannot have it both ways: either it has strategic importance and so, for defence reas-
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
ons, it is not appropriate to give the information, or it has no, or only minimal, strategic importance. I confirm that the major use of the pipeline is commercial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One question to which we should like a reply relates to the interest of Opposition Members in national security. For a considerable period during the last Parliament, the Royal Air Force was prevented from flying. Even the operational squadrons were prevented from flying at maximum performance and restricted to 15 hours flying per pilot per month. That was never a secret, because it was raised in the House. When the Royal Air Force operates like that, fuel demands are much lower, but when the Royal Air Force operates in an exercise capacity, which it usually does, at least once a year, when aircraft may fly for wartime hours and at wartime performance levels, clearly the demand for fuel is much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the Minister must not give information that affects national security, but the national security interest is not the same as that of the Conservative party. The lack of activity in the Royal Air Force meant that the civilian use of the pipeline expanded. So what happens when the reverse applies and an exercise presents a much greater fuel consumption requirement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to go further than I have already gone. I made it clear that two things are important and relevant to our discussion. I confirmed that although the major use of the pipeline and the major part of its revenue are commercial, the Government nevertheless acknowledge firmly the strategic importance of the pipeline. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman should allow me time to develop the argument. After all, the Committee was generous in the time that it allowed him to develop his arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Southgate asked whether the system was fully utilised, and if not, how much room there was for improvement. My reply to that important question will relate to some extent to what was said by the hon. Member for Wentworth. It would be inappropriate to expect all parts of the system to be fully utilised at present. In saying that, I express no criticism of the BNOC staff, who have worked to try to improve commercial utilisation of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for underutilisation is straightforward. Some sections of the system, such as Humberside, where that is a high commercial demand for usage of the system, are used to capacity by the commercial companies. But in other areas—areas that are directly related to the operational requirements of the Royal Air Force, for example, airfields in East Anglia—there is not a heavy demand for petroleum products. So there is a mixed pattern across the system. In areas with good scope for commercial use there is a high utilisation, but it would be unfair of the Government to expect full utilisation in areas where strategic defence issues are involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are local authorities aware of the location of the pipelines? If there is a pipeline in my constituency, could a firm tap into it to help to relieve the high unemployment there? Are there tenders for the commercial sections? Does the Department accept the highest bidder? Or is there a restriction on the number of firms that can tender? Will the Minister also tell us about employment aspects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be appropriate for me to deal with the employment aspects. However, I believe that local authorities would be aware of pipelines in the area. Those who might wish to use it and those who would be responsible for managing the pipeline would have to negotiate on whether there is scope for commercial usage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to BNOC and its staff for the fact that in recent years—certainly since it took over the management of the pipeline—it has achieved a big improvement in utilisation of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked me about the charges made for the use of the pipeline. The commercial users are charged market-based tariffs negotiated on a commercial basis. BNOC has increased both the commercial utilisation and the commercial charges in recent years. It has more than doubled the commercial revenue since it became involved in the pipeline in 1977. I pay tribute to it, as that has been achieved against a background of a decline in the United Kingdom products market. That illustrates BNOC's commercial motivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The performance has helped to move the system from a substantial cash deficit to cash surplus. Improvements in the utilisation and efficiency of the system are still being made. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney drew attention to that in the analysis of the accounts in the latest annual report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a stage where there is less scope for expansion of commercial revenue because of the increase in utilisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charges for military usage are related to the costs of the use of the system, which is on a different basis from the commercial use of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred to the agency's agreement with the Department, which he also referred to on an earlier amendment, No. 30. BNOC is charged with general management of the system on behalf of the Government. Its specific duties under the agreement include the improvement of the system and its commercial profitability, the technical and financial control of the operating agents, the provision of defence and emergency services, the maintenance and renewal of the system, and the preparation of the budget and accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a new agreement between the agency and the Department would be desirable. The terms and conditions of the agreement would be for negotiation with the agency. However, I recognise the advantage from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
agency's point of view of including in the agreement as much security and stability as can be expected. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that if there is not certainty and continuity, the agency would not necessarily work in the best possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, under clause 3(1), the agency will inherit all BNOC's rights and obligations under its existing agency agreement with the Department. That agreement will remain in force until it expires or a new agreement is negotiated. I hope that work on the agreement will proceed expeditiously once the Bill has been enacted and the new agency has been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In providing this background information, I have merely confirmed many of the details provided earlier by the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that I. have emphasised some of the most relevant points. I confirm what was said by my hon. Friends the Members for Southgate and for Bedfordshire, North. The Government believe that the public sector should not be involved in activities which can be performed in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our sitting on 23 May, the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney remarked:
	<br><blockquote><p>" To sell assets related to the security of supply is pretty low."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 23 May 1985; c. 6.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman should reflect on that. I have acknowledged the strategic importance of the pipeline system and my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North has reminded us of that importance. It is worth remembering that, as my hon. Friend explained, the pipelines supplying oil products to military bases in the United States are in general privately owned and run. Therefore, there is no heaven-sent right for them to be in the public sector rather than the private sector, or vice versa. My hon. Friend made several perfectly reasonable points about other essential supplies that would be required at a time of national emergency. It was because of those requirements that, in line with their general principles, the Government decided to ex amine whether the pipeline system could be privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to know not only the background to the pipeline system but the background against which privatisation has been considered. It is worth remembering that it was my predecessor who decided to engage consultants to examine the pipeline system to see what efficiency savings could be made in its operation. It is also significant that it was partly in response to BNOC's proposals that that examination was carried out. That demonstrates not only BNOC's commercial motivation but the corporation's achievements since it took over management of the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why the Government are abolishing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that we should abolish the present management of the pipeline. I shall give my reasons later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to the background to the privatisation proposals. The winners of the competition to select a company to perform the investigation were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
PA and Pipeline Technology Ltd. They were asked to take a preliminary look at the command structure of the operation. It is fairly complex, as our debates have shown. One of the options examined was privatisation, but the remit did not call for a full examination. The consultants rightly expressed caution about the adoption of that option. They said that the Government would need to be satisfied that defence interests could be properly protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report was not and cannot be published for reasons of both defence and commercial confidentiality. Following the report, a working party was established to see how defence interests could best be protected, and to consider alternative structures. A number of problems must be dealt with, relating partly to the contractural terms necessary to protect military interests, on which I would have to be satisfied, and partly to commercial considerations. As I have explained, the segments of the system that are costly to maintain are unlikely to attract commercial custom to defray the costs. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are a great many sedentary interventions from the Opposition Front Bench. Hon. Members know perfectly well that such interventions are not permitted. Some Opposition Members have had an opportunity to speak and they were heard in reasonable silence. The Minister is also entitled to be heard in reasonable silence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Knox. I think that Opposition Members are worried because I have answered some of their questions. Sometimes the truth can be hard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from defence and commercial considerations, there is a third area. Privatisation would require legislation, which would have a considerable effect on the time scale of any proposals. It would be undesirable—the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was correct to raise this—to subject BNOC staff to another threat of dislocation in addition to that created by the abolition of BNOC. For all those reasons, the Government decided not to consider privatisation further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeet</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said quite reasonably on Second Reading that he was prepared to accept the undertakings of the companies on supply in times of emergency. Why did he not also accept their undertakings on pipelines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this case we are dealing with a much narrower, more sensitive issue of defence. It needs to be examined further, as the consultants appointed to examine the issue said. Given the time scale and the need to avoid further dislocation of staff, the Government decided not to prcceed with the privatisation option now. However, an} future Government would, of course, be free to consider the possibility. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friends will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting again, but the information was not available. Would it not have made sense for the consultants who did the
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
investigation—their remit was to go so far and no further—to do an in-depth study and produce a report on all aspects of the organisation, as compared with the partial study that there has been?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair option, but we did not reach that option. A working party was set up, following the consultants' recommendations, but that process was overtaken by the Government's decision. No doubt if the matter is considered in future, it is an option that people responsible at the time may wish to consider. It was perfectly fair for the hon. Gentleman to raise the matter, but that stage was not reached because the Government took their decision without going that far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having taken the decision to retain the pipelines system in the public sector, I agree with my hon. Friends that we shall need to require the agency to consider carefully what improvements it can make in the efficiency with which the system operates. I take to heart what was said in this debate about the need to ensure that appropriate incentive arrangements are contained in the new agency agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier sitting, we debated the usefulness of incentive payments in a slightly different context, and there was agreement between the two sides of the Committee that opportunities should be sought to give them to the agency wherever possible. At present, BNOC receives a form of incentive payment, in that 1 per cent. of commercial revenues go to BNOC, so an incentive element is already built into its present agreement. That encourages BNOC to maximise the commercial private sector revenues. Of course, the corporation does not at present pass on any part of those incentives to the staff in its land pipelines department Following our debate, I made a note to ask the agency to consider devising an incentive arrangement by which it can reward its staff for improving efficiency and increasing the commercial revenues. That is a useful suggestion, although it may be easier in principle than in practice. However, I undertake to ask the agency to consider the possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the amendments proposed by the hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Wentworth. The duties of BNOC are defined in an agency agreement, in which BNOC is the agent and my Department, on behalf of the Crown, is the principal. I am slightly concerned that hon. Members are thinking of the agreements such as those with the commercial customers who use the system or with the operating agents such as the British Pipeline Agency. BNOC may negotiate agreements with operating agents on behalf of my Department, but it has no power to enter into them. My Department is the signatory to those agreements. Of course, my Department consults other interested Departments, of which the Ministry of Defence is the most involved, as appropriate. I suspect that the practice is, and always has been, that which Opposition Members seek through their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have explained, the agreements with commercial users of the system are negotiated by BNOC in the context of the Government's desire to see the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
maximum commercial use of the system for sound economic reasons. The Government have neither the desire nor the expertise to perform that function and it therefore makes no sense, to subject the agency to specific control and approval in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also a host of minor agreements which the agency and other agents involved in the system would have to enter into, such as agreements with contractors to make repairs or whatever. It would be an intolerable bureaucratic burden to make all those agreements also subject to the approval of the Secretaries of State for Defence and Energy. Therefore, given the way that the present system operates and the way that we envisage the system operating in the future—precisely along the lines that the Opposition seek in the amendment—it would be unnecessary and would add to the burdens of the agency if the amendment were written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 deals with the preparation and publication of separate accounts for the function of managing the pipelines system. It would be helpful if I explained how the accounting procedures for this function will be operated. The position is similar to that for royalty-in-kind oil which I have already mentioned and to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North referred. The Secretary of State is accountable to the House for the running of the system. For reasons of security, the accounts cannot be published, but they are of course scrutinised by the National Audit Office, so the Comptroller and Auditor General can report any concern that he has about the accounts to the Public Accounts Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency's accounts relating to the system will therefore simply include the amount of the agency fee received from the Department, and the direct costs which it incurs, such as the salaries of the staff whom it employs to undertake that activity. The accounts will be totally straightforward—as those hon. Members who have quoted from them have shown—and I can see no grounds for going to the additional expense of having them prepared and published separately. In any case, a detailed accounting provision of the sort requested by the amendment would not be appropriate for a Bill which seeks to steer clear of prescribing the form and content of accounts in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what motivates the Opposition here. However, if at any time the Secretary of State considered it desirable for certain information on the activity of managing the system to be shown separately, it would be open to him to require that by issuing an accounts notice in accordance with paragraph 9 of schedule 3. So the power is already within the Bill for the accounts to be published in any way that might be thought more appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful debate on this portion of the Bill which covers one of the three major functions to be transferred from BNOC to the new agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated the privatisation issue, as was proper, and I hope that my hon. Friends will rest
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
assured that the option was considered by the Government. It remains an option for the future, but for the reasons that I have explained the Government have not felt it right to choose that option now, and I recommend to the Committee that the amendment be not accepted, and I hope at the same time that I am meeting the anxieties of the Opposition about the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither can I recommend that the Committee accept amendments Nos. 31 and 32, although I understand the motives behind them. I can, however, assure the hon. Gentlemen who tabled the amendments that many of their arguments are already covered by present practice and what will be the practice in future or by powers given in the Bill to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed to hear the Minister tell the Committee that he cannot give us information on the Bill because he fears for national security. Whenever I have heard Ministers refuse information on the grounds of national security, I have told myself that they are doing so to ensure that our defence system is properly secure. But I do not have a great deal of confidence in the Government when they use that argument because, not very long after I came into the House and six weeks before the Falklands crisis my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Callaghan)—the former Prime Minister—asked why protection ships had been removed from the Falkland islands. My right hon. Friend asked for assurances that the province was well protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer given to my right hon. Friend was similar to that given by the Minister today: for reasons of security no information could be given. Six weeks later, the House was responsible for sending young soldiers to give their lives for the Falklands as a result of the incompetence of Her Majesty's. Government in failing to protect the province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only 10 days ago, a Select Committee gave the House information—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is perfectly legitimate for the hon. Gentleman to make the analogy he is making, but he cannot, on the Oil and Pipelines Bill, enter into a discussion of the Falklands war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to come to oil, Mr. Knox, if you will allow me. Only 10 days ago, information came from a Select Committee to show that within two years this country will not have enough oil tankers to cope with another Falklands crisis. We do not want another Falklands, but surely the purpose of defence is to ensure that we do not get ourselves into such a position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister hides behind the security argument, we cannot tell whether the pipelines and the storage facilities have been properly maintained. He will not tell us. I have a background in engineering, and I know that a facility can deteriorate to a bad state of repair within weeks, and it is when such a facility is needed most that it is discovered to be in a great deal of trouble. Surely hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
Members should know whether facilities have been properly maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Senior Members of the House say that Back Benchers should guard their rights jealously. If Back Benchers are denied information by the Minister, no other body should have that information, yet the Minister tells us that he is involved with PA International Consulting Services Limited. I should not put a lot of faith in that company, because James Howden and Company Limited in Glasgow, a company for which I once worked, had several factories on which PA was asked to advise. The factory in which I worked was the only one that accepted PA's proposals: the other factories threw them out. Those factories still exist, but the factory in which I worked was put out of business by PA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to record the fact that, before entering the House, I worked for several years for PA management consultants and that I am still associated with that company. It is dishonourable to say that the company cannot be trusted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a strange remark from someone who is involved with the company. If the hon. Gentleman were sitting in a Committee dealing with local government, he would not be able to make such a contribution because his interests would prevent him from being involved in the discussions. It is a pity that the hon. Gentleman did not get to his feet when the Minister said that PA management consultants was the firm involved in the project. We should then all have known where the hon. Member for Rochford stood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) has done nothing dishonourable. The House does not require that hon. Members should refrain from participating in debates because they have certain interests. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) should keep his remarks to the amendments under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is in order to say what he likes about the company as long as his remarks relate to the amendment. That is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned PA consultants: I did not. Furthermore, the only wage that I receive is my salary as a Member of Parliament. It would be helpful if every hon. Member was in the same position, rather than having consultancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman's personal finances have nothing to do with the amendment. Will the hon. Gentleman return to the amendment under discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. Knox. I warn the Minister not to put his faith in PA consultants, be-
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
cause it has a track record of shutting down factories. I should not like PA to shut down the pipelines. I hope that the hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) will take that observation back to PA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I was interrupted, I was about to ask whether the Minister could assure us that the information that had been withheld from hon. Members had also been withheld from PA consultants. As a Member of the House, I should not be denied information when a private organisation, which is not accountable to the House, is given it. It means that people are getting security information to which they are not entitled. They are not obliged to keep it secret, especially from a foreign power or organisation that may not be friendly with this country. Will the Minister give such an assurance? If so, how can he tell the House that PA consultants are doing a proper job without the necessary information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also says that he agrees with the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North that the private sector can distribute this country's food supplies. Tesco, Marks and Spencer and other companies are very efficient at distributing food, but the Minister failed to mention that one does not get the food without paying the going rate—the price set down by those organisations. If the pipelines are controlled by a private organisation, will we have to pay the going rate for defence? The Minister has not answered those questions and he should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we never have to use our defence facilities, but, if we do, I hope that the Minister will not be recorded in history as being incompetent and unable to cope with our defences, especially in a front line system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redmond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to interrupt the Minister because it is wrong to do so once he gets in full flow. I wish to make two brief points on the investigation by the working party or the consultants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister said that the organisation was prevented from making an in-depth study because the Government had made decisions that obliterated the need for it. Surely the Government or any organisation need the full facts to make a decision. The fact that the Government's decision pre-empted the investigation could be the reason why all their decisions since 1979, especially on local government, have been wrong. The Government have to come back with legislation to rectify mistakes. I may have read the Minister wrong. I hope that he will say that, when the Government make a decision, they have all the facts so that their decision is the correct one for the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister clarify his reply about whether the commercial sector tendered for the use of the land? He said that negotiations took place between the commercial sector and the governing body. How can we be sure that those negotiations reaped the proper benefits? Is there no possibility of the use going out to tender? Several firms in this country could make use of it. Does a closed shop operate between certain firms with negotiations taking place on the usage, or is it an open shop,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
with one firm bidding against another? I know that the Government wish to open up fair competition, but if the list of firms is restricted, fair negotiations cannot take place with the Deparement, and the Department cannot reap the benefits of usage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right to protect national security is vital and must be jealously guarded. No one would quarrel with that. But hon. Members have another right—the right to information. That, too, must be jealously guarded. Had we not pressed the matter at the beginning of the Committee stage, I do not think that we would have known about any of these goings-on. There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that the Minister intended to explain what had been going on in the Department, or why they did not pursue privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister opened the Second Reading debate and explained the purposes of the Bill and the policy decisions behind it, I do not remember his saying a single word about the options that the Government had been considering behind the scenes. The pressures that we have applied between the sittings motion and our present debate have lifted the veil a little to disclose what was clearly intended to remain an in-house secret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An announcement was made this week, quite properly, in press release on blue-headed Department of Energy writing paper, telling us which banker the Secretary of State had chosen to privatise British Gas and which bunch of accountants he had chosen to tidy up all the preparations. Will the Minister tell us whether the exercise that we are discussing, which involved a major outside consultancy, was reported in either a press release or a parliamentary written answer? Was it made public that the Government had put the operation out to tender and had chosen PA rather than Pipeline Technology Limited?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochford (Dr. Clark) intervened to say that he was a consultant for PA. That was very proper, and we do not wish to impugn his integrity. Let me, however, ask the hon. Gentleman a simple question: has he seen the report and the information that the Minister says he cannot give the Committee? If he says that he has not, we shall accept his assurance. But if he has, the rest of us are put in an invidious position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen the report. I made my earlier intervention to make it clear that the company to which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) referred was one of high repute. That does not necessarily mean that I have seen every report that it has produced. I work for the general management consultancy division, not the oil and gas division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his reply. I was merely seeking clarification. I am sure that he appreciates the invidious position in which the Committee would have been placed if one of its members had had sight of information which was being withheld from the rest of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
As I have said, I think that there are two rights which should be jealously guarded: the right to national security and the right of Members of Parliament to receive information. I repeat my request for an overall breakdown of receipts from the three payers in the system—the commercial sector, the Ministry of Defence and the United States Air Force. We do not want details of locations. National security issues arise if we can pinpoint details such as where, how and to what extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the commercial sector overwhelmingly pays the receipts, but does it pay 50 per cent., 60 per cent. or 70 per cent.? The hon. Member for Southgate and I asked whether usage was on a 75 per cent., commercial, 25 per cent. military basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that as storage was a facility for military strategic reserves, the receipts paid by the Ministry of Defence or the United States Air Force would be appreciably higher than in other parts of the system. I cannot see how the Soviet Union or anyone else could make much of a more forthcoming statement of the financing of the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's description of the system of accounts was interesting. He made a simple admission that BNOC had been extremely successful commercially since taking over the operation, so yet another reason for its abolition has disappeared. It was effective in managing and handling those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took copious notes when the Minister explained why the Government had turned their back on privatisation. He said that BNOC had prompted the management exercise and said that it would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was implied that BNOC was suggesting or possibly encouraging the concept of privatisation. I inferred that BNOC might also have wished to consider the privatisation option. I hope that the Minister will confirm that BNOC did not want these activities to be taken away from it or for privatisation to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went on to say that PA Management Consultants had advocated caution and care, and put a warning hand on the Department of Energy on the option of privatisation. I think that he said that it had counselled a careful and cautious approach to privatisation, and so did not recommend that as such. Is that a reasonable interpretation of the conclusion of the PA and its work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a right to know more about the interdepartmental working party report. The Minister gave three reasons why, as a result of the report, the Government did not proceed to privatisation, but came up with the idea of transferring the BNOC functions to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, and I hope that I am not misquoting, the Minister said that there were considerable problems concerning the contractural terms of the military interests. When the Department went through this exercise did not it receive strong representations from the United States authorities as well as from the

	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
Ministry of Defence not to proceed with privatisation? The Minister pointed to the United States experience and patted his hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, North on the back for making the comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States is not relevant to the issues of stategic reserves in a small island, close to Europe and within the short to medium distance strike capacity of any potential enemy. That is a different position in the conventional sense or in the nuclear sense from that of an enormous continent like the United States. No such comparison is valid. Did the United States authorities jump up and down in agitation when they discovered that the British Government were seriously considering privatisation? Is that what we should read on top or, or in conjunction with, the statement that there were problems concerning the contractual terms of the military interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will have noticed that the Minister carefully referred to the general position in the United States. He said that generally the American pipelines are in private ownership. That suggests that there is an exception which his hon. Friends would not tolerate. Does my hon. Friend also accept that NATO's view may also have been sought and received?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about NATO. I strongly suspect that the United States authorities had a strong view about it, because they pay money into the system and have made certain assumptions about its ownership and the arrangements on a country-to-country basis. The Minister did not reply to a specific question which I asked, namely whether the United States' use of the system is on a country-to-country basis. However, I am more interested to know exactly what is meant by saying that the contractural terms of the military interest is one of the major problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to contractors in the United States. Surely in the United States if the private companies operate the pipeline system, the fuel requirements of the US Air Force are known. Therefore, it would be easier there to get the information relating to the United States than it is here to get the information that we seek about the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on to a good point; that is probably true. I have a feeling that a congressional committee of the Senate or of the House of Representatives would certainly not be willing to accept the generalised observations and remarks, coupled with interesting nuggets of information, that the Minister provided in reply to an important and, as he described it extremely useful debate. It is the first occasion for a long time that the House has discussed the system. I have a feeling that the congressional committee would not accept the mixture of small pieces of information and bland generalisations. If Standing Committees had an investigative role as the new Procedure Committee report suggests, we might not have our
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
present problems in responding to the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that you are about to rise, Mr. Knox, to stop me wandering into matters of procedure which I certainly shall not do. However, it is relevant because we are using the only procedure available to us which is persistent refusal to accept the ministerial statement and move on to the next amendment before we have adequate answers to our questions. My hon. Friend is right that congressional system would have offered a greater ability to obtain detailed information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to go over this again, but the case was not presented to us on Second Reading. This is our first opportunity to debate it. The Minister said that the second problem of privatisation was that it would lead to a costly division within the system. I first mentioned the possibility that there was a study and interdepartmental working party reports when we discussed the sittings motion. I then sought the information that would have made this debate much easier to handle. I said that we needed it before we went on to the nitty gritty of the Bill. We have had to move amendments to try to obtain that information. I said that I thought that one of the options was to split the system—flog off the commercially successful parts and dump on the Ministry of Defence the remaining obligations in respect of the strategic parts of the pipelines, particularly the east Anglian pipeline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we got confirmation that that was exactly what was considered, but it was rejected. It was a small but pleasant surprise that the Government considered that option. In every other case of privatisation, they have done almost the reverse. They have sought where possible to sell off the profitable parts and leave the public sector to pick up the debts and liabilities. That is not an unusual feature of privatisation. It is very much a feature of the Oil and Gas (Enterprise) Act 1982, which left BNOC trading on a very small margin while the whole of the profitable exploration and production side was hived off to Britoil. That was the only way in which the Government could have undertaken that privatisation. They left the poor taxpayer to pay for the minority strategic interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support and are strangely surprised by the Minister's belated conversion and his decision not to split the system by flogging off the best parts and leaving the costly parts to the public sector. I suspect that the hon. Members for Enfield, Southgate and for Bedfordshire, North will not be altogether happy with that, but the Opposition are happy to give our backing to the Minister in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third reason is that legislation would be necessary. That has not inhibited the Government in bringing in a Bill—virtually at the end of the Session—to abolish the British National Oil Corporation, and expecting the Opposition to watch sleepily as it goes by. I do not find that reason convincing. Indeed, it is rather worrying. Will the Government bring forward a Bill in another legislative Session?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
The Minister used the time-honoured words "not at present ". When dealing with privatisation, we have long since learnt that " not at present " frequently means " not this year, but we completely changed our mind last year ". We had many such assurances about British Gas, yet the future has been a matter of only a few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not trust the Government when they make such observations, and I hope that we shall have the opportunity to vote on the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Southgate. I hope that he will not withdraw it, because the Committee needs to reject amendments supporting privatisation. We shall certainly reject them and, judging from the half-hearted case put forward by the Minister, he will join us in voting against those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not pursued with the Minister a number of interesting observations that he made about the future development of the pipeline installation system. We are proposing a new clause which encapsulates some of the Minister's points, and we shall have an opportunity to pursue them later. At last we have succeeded in lifting a small part of the veil covering the role and functions of the pipeline and, in doing so, we have lifted a bit of the veil of government. The Government were secretly considering embarking on a completely different course, but have now changed their mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister has still not answered the questions that I asked him about the role of the US Air Force and other American authorities. Nor do we know the MOD's view on those matters or what is meant by contractual terms in a military context. We must continue to debate the amendments until we obtain the most complete answer possible without prejudice to national security. Labour Members do not believe that that has been achieved so far, and we hope that the Minister will respond to our representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Martin) was confusing two issues concerning what may and may not be disclosed to the Committee. The points he made in his earlier intervention related to information published in the accounts. That was the context in which I raised the matter, and I stand by what I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the specific point raised by the hon. Gentleman in relation to the PA report. A distinction must be drawn between that report, which was for the Secretary of State and was private, and the proceedings of this House, which are published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I to take it that PA received information that has been withheld from hon. Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, PA conducted its investigation on a confidential basis, whereas the proceedings of this Committee are conducted on a public basis. Therefore, it is not appropriate for me to disclose what was done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. Redmond) raised two points. First, I can assure him that proposals for changes in the future would be made only after thorough consideration and consultation. He also asked me whether tender procedures might be more appropriate for pipeline users. Each oil company has different points of origin and different destinations for its product, which makes a tender procedure inappropriate. However, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no closed shop. BNOC has been willing to deal with any company which perceives a possible use of the pipeline system and I have little doubt that the corporation will seek to maximise its overall commercial revenues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney raised a number of serious points. He asked about the arrangements with the United States Air Force. There is an agreement between the Secretary of State for Energy and the United States Government. The United States Air Force discusses operational matters with a director of BNOC and the operating agents. At the same time, it co-ordinates with the Ministry of Defence on issues of defence policy. I hope that that explanation helps to show the hon. Gentleman exactly how the arrangement works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State have an arrangement with, say, the United States department of energy or with the Pentagon? With whom does he have this agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to contemplate that one to give a precise answer. The arrangement is at Government level but I need notice to be able to give the precise personal level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney also asked about consultation on privatisation. The Ministry of Defence and the United States Air Force were of course consulted, but as those discussions covered a confidential defence issue I shall not disclose details. It would be covered again in future, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about BNOC's involvement in consideration of privatisation. I shall repeat what I said. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not follow my remarks as closely as he usually does. The decision to engage consultants, ultimately PA, was made partly as a result of proposals from BNOC on efficiency savings. The option of privatisation emerged from the PA consultants report. I made that point at the time and I emphasise it again today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is no question of the Government hiding anything. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has taken great credit for the fact that Opposition Members have lifted up a corner to expose something that is not in fact happening at all. Earlier, the hon. Gentleman was waving Department of Energy press notices: The topic of the study was covered in a press note of 12 August 1982 and was public knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to the PA-PLT report in the BNOC annual report and accounts for 1983.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1984-1985V002P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
If the hon. Gentleman had been assiduous he would have been able to follow my remarks. Specific reference was made to the possibility of privatisation in the Treasury White Paper on continuing activity in response to the financial management initiative. That paper was published in July 1984. In all those ways the facts about and possibility of privatisation were made known. There is no question of the Government hiding anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting collection of words being dropped here and there. Has any Minister at the Department of Energy ever made any observation to that effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The press release of 12 August 1982 contained quotations from a predecessor of mine. The Department of Energy has been involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment. In the light of my assurance on the other two amendments, I hope that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney will not press them, either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by congratulating my right hon. Friend on his 15th anniversary, because it is 15 years ago today that he was first made a Minister of the Crown. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Hannam) because today is the 15th anniversary of his election to the House, whereupon a very distinguished career has followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) made several remarks about my speech, some of which were not exactly flattering and some of which were a little unfair. I wish to deal with some of them before I turn to the body of my argument. The hon. Member was not as fair to me as he might have been. I remind the Committee of some of the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
