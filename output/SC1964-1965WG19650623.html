	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Agriculture in Wales and Monmouthshire.—
	<i>[Mr. James Griffiths.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate on agriculture takes place today in the Welsh Grand Committee at a sensible time of the year and also at a sensible time of day. The land is looking its best, or it was when we from Wales saw Welsh land, lambing and shearing are almost over and the lowland valleys are the scene of the cutting of hay and silage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is normal to confess an interest in the subject of any debate, and I do so today. I have an interest in Welsh black cattle, Welsh sheep and Welsh ponies. Long may they thrive. Just as the Secretary of State said in December that he spoke as a miner, I speak today as a farmer. Farming and mining account for a large proportion of the employment of Welsh people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is three months since the February Price Review. Therefore, it is a little easier to see and to understand how it has been received and how it has affected the general trend of farm economy. Even the most optimistic could hardly say that the Review was greeted with shouts of glee. It was, and remains, a disappointment. I am glad that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is here today with his responsibility for Welsh agriculture. We on this side of the Committee, and no doubt hon. Members opposite, look forward to hearing whether he has any good news for Welsh agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farming industry has been very disturbed about the inadequacy of the Review. Of course, it was not an agreed Review. The National Farmers Union, soon after its launching, campaigned to
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
put over to the holiday public that the profitability of the industry had fallen in recent years and members of the Union put posters on trees and barns. Those posters were written in moderate language and were a sober appraisal of the state of the average farmer. This was an effort by the N.F.U. to tell the city dweller on holiday that the farming community did not believe that it was getting a fair crack of the whip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Breconshire we saw curious action taken by the planning committee. I refer to it this morning because I believe it is of interest and needs to be gone into. The Breckonshire Planning Committee, whether or not it was within or without the law, ordered the National Farmers Union to take down the posters, not only those on public buildings, such as are described as fly posters, but those on private property and farm buildings. This Committee may be aware that those posters were not written in insulting or heavy language. They were in the sort of language in which normally honourable people freely state their cases to the British public. I thought it extremely odd—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Iorwerth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who paid for them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that the members of the National Farmers Union paid for them. This was a high-handed action taken by the planning committee. It was not done by the Radnorshire Planning Committee, which deals with the same branch of the Union as does the Breconshire Planning Committee. Nor do I think that any other Welsh planning committee took this action. Was the action due to any particular factor? The planning committee may have been carrying out the letter of the law, but things seem to have come to a pretty pass in Wales when a planning committee forbids such notices being placed on private property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are banners to be forbidden at protest meetings in future? Are notices advertising fetes and football matches to be forbidden? Is criticism of our largest industry, couched in very modest terms, to be so resented that the iron hand of planning is to fall on it in this way? This was unsatisfactory, even if the planning committee was acting, as it claimed, according to the strict letter of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
In Wales the part of the Price Review which was the greatest disappointment, particularly in certain parts of the country, was the raising of the price of milk by only 1d. a gallon. Some counties, particularly Carmarthen, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan and parts of Glamorgan, are probably the most affected. It is easy to argue that the Price Review has not resulted in milk shortages yet, but I give this warning. The weather since the Review has been particularly suitable for milk production. It will not be until the autumn, when spring calvers are starting to dry off, that we shall get the true picture of the production of liquid milk. In our opinion, the 1d. a gallon on the guarantee was not adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the question of wool. This is possibly one of the most important products, and always has been, in the Welsh hills. I would not put it too highly, but the Price Review White Paper did not give a quite correct picture. On page 44 it said that there was no change in the price. What it failed to note was that the administrative costs of the Wool Board mean an extra ½d. a 1b. So wool will fetch that much less this year. This may seem a derisory amount, but if we multiply it by the 10 million pounds in weight, we find that it makes £20,833, which is not an inconsiderate amount. Although people who do not know the industry are inclined to say that wool is all right and that producers are doing pretty well out of it, how many farmers today are bothering to shear their lambs? Many do not find it worth while because there is not so much money in wool production as there was a few years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to beef, the increase of 4s. a cwt. looks all right, but it is misleading because it all depends on when the stock is marketed. This is a very complicated trade. With world supplies and demand changing as they are, with more Argentine beef going to European countries and less to us, we shall need to increase our home beef production. I doubt if the present incentives of£18 per hill cow—£13 for the cow and £5 for winter keep supplement—will prove sufficient. The National Farmers' Union has suggested that a beef suckler herd which would not be limited to the hill areas might prove a long-term incentive to added beef production which certainly is needed. I ask the Minister his views about this sugges-
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
tion. Does he favour this idea? Does he think it would work? If so, can he tell us how it would work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point we should look at is whether the balance between beef and milk production is correct. There are certain areas in Wales where sometimes there is the question of whether it was right immediately after the war to encourage those areas to go in for milk production. It may be that some of those producers are quite unable to get out of that particular line; they cannot afford to do so. The farmer's wife says, "I must have my weekly cheque. Whatever the price imposed by the milk guarantee system, the weekly cheque comes along." As milk is such a specialised and mechanised line nowadays, could not a case be made for looking at particular farms—this would have to be selective—to see whether or not there could be incentives for certain milk producers to change over to beef suckling?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cereals production is a matter which farmers have taken very seriously indeed, particularly those in the valley areas. Without going over the arguments discussed in the House by my hon. and right hon. Friends, I stress that the Government have taken their full 4 per cent. allowed under the 1957 Agriculture Act. They may argue that there are international agreements which have to be fulfilled, but they are entirely unjustified in saying that they were forced to take the full 4 per cent. in a Price Review which gave an under-recoupment of £18½ million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the specifically Welsh problems? Nowhere is the small farm problem more pressing. A Conservative Government made great strides with the small farmer schemes. I am glad to see that the upper limits are to be raised, but in paragraph 12 of the White Paper, referring to structure, the Government recommend amalgamations. They are said to be working out a scheme for compensating older small farmers whose farms might be amalgamated. If a scheme is to come, let there be no delay because there are a number of such cases outstanding. I should like to know what is in the mind of the Minister about this, if he favours what is foreshadowed in the White Paper and how the scheme would be administered. Whatever is done in the small
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
farmer section, let us remember that no size of farm can prosper unless the farm economy as a whole is healthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supply of electricity over the years in the country areas has done particularly well in Wales and the Welsh Electricity Board is to be congratulated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Fred Peart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A nationalised board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but many individual people outside have lent their weight to and given a great deal of advice on this programme. With the little knowledge I have of electricity in Wales and just across the Border, I should say that the position in Wales has been very well looked after, but there are still farms at the end of the line. The fewer they become the more expensive it becomes to connect from the capital point of view. I am not asking for anything specific this morning, but I am drawing attention to the problem. Often those farms at the end of the line and yet to be connected are not the richest in the farming community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another specific service in the country is that of by-roads. Here again we can take credit for the 1955 Agriculture (Improvement of Roads) Act by which £4 million was used to bring unadopted roads up to standard. Most of this was spent in mid-Wales and a good proportion in Montgomeryshire, Breconshire and Radnorshire. All I say here is, do not let us lose sight of the fact that roads do not automatically keep up their pristine condition. Let the impetus be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the question of the veterinary side, which is referred to in paragraph 5 of the White Paper. It says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government are determined to secure better control of animal diseases which cost the industry many millions".</p></blockquote>
"Hear, hear," I say. This is an important question, and I should like to see what action the Government are taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper they do not refer specifically to any particular diseases which they intend to try to get rid of. I would put in a strong plea here for considering that whereas Wales was used as the first clean area to get rid of bovine tuberculosis, which has had such
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
a great effect on the improvement of human health, and has led to the shutting down of sanataria—or shall I say a change in use of sanataria for tuberculosis, such as the one at Craig-y-nos, to hospitals—we could well consider the necessity of getting rid of bovine brucellosis, or contagious abortion. Let us ask ourselves how many calves are lost every year, and how many human beings suffer from undulent fever. This is not only a Welsh problem. This is a matter which I have pursued with more than one Minister, and I am hoping for a good answer one day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should use Wales for the furtherance of a pioneer scheme of slaughter policy with regard to brucellosis. Twenty years ago in the United States they were taking this matter very seriously. They had a slaughter policy there, and it is high time that we had one here. I hope that the Minister will not say that the Ministry's vets are too busy to carry out this campaign, because I do not accept that. If the public knew the dangers, I am sure that there would be a greater public outcry about it than there has been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tying in with the veterinary problem, there is the importance of the greater publicity which must be given to our Welsh livestock, both for marketing at home, and also for export on the hoof. When we have Welsh travel films, or Welsh publicity of any sort, whether films or paper advertisements, we should see that the qualities of our particular Welsh breeds are given great prominence. This is not always so, and one gets some Welsh publications which entirely disregard the attractions, the qualities, and the importance of these breeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must not go too far in this, otherwise I shall be accused of pushing my own cattle, but, good as Scotch beef is, and good as its name is, I believe that our Welsh beef is just as good, and it is of interest that Produce Studies Ltd. have made certain market studies in Mid-Wales dealing with Welsh lamb and the suckled calf problem. These reports show that Welsh lamb is as popular with certain people at certain times of the year as that of our great competitor, New Zealand. I think that once the qualities are known, the drum should be beaten, the trumpet should be blown, and the walls of ignorance will fall down. It is important that we should know the true
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
quality of what we are producing. We must take the opportunity of pushing our products and I often think that in Wales we fail to do that sufficiently. Perhaps we are not brazen enough, but anyhow we should make an attempt to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government in their White Paper talk about long-term plans for the industry. I wish that I could see something which gave me reason to believe that the Government were producing them. Nothing is more important to a farmer than to be able to take a long-term view, and I hope that today the right hon. Gentleman will be able to tell us something of the long-term plans which the Government say they have. The first Review has been a great disappointment to Welsh farmers, and I hope that this morning the Minister will say something which will go some way to curing the mood of disappointment now felt by the farmers of Wales</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Welsh Affairs (Mr. Goronwy Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I begin by inviting hon. Members to look at Welsh agriculture as a whole, and try to indicate the main structural features of the industry and the nature of its production. We might then consider whether Government policy is broadly suited to its proper development and encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with an industry organised into about 50,000 holdings of various sizes, some of them quite small, and covering about 4¼ million acres of land. Owing to contour and climate, only about 2½ million acres of this land is cropped, and nearly 1¼ million acres are taken up by rough grazings. Indeed, a further 500,000 acres of agricultural land in Wales are common rough grazings. So much for structure.

As to manpower, about 42,000 of out people regard themselves as farmers, and obviously many of these are part-time farmers operating non-viable units. They employ, in total about 26,000 regular workers and about 6,000 casual workers, and we know that in addition the Welsh family farm depends very much on the farmer's wife. That is the manpower position. It is a large industry, perhaps the largest in Wales, in regard to employment, both self-employed and employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main concern of this very hardworking section of the Welsh popula-
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
tion is livestock and its products. Whenever possible, the Welsh farmer grows crops, and in fact he benefits by about £1½ million every year from deficiency payments on cereals, but, nevertheless, grass is the foundation of his economy and his income comes mainly from milk and from fat and store stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wales is a land flowing with milk, if not always with honey. We sell about 240 million gallons of milk every year, but it is also important to note that Wales is an important stock-raising country. Certification centres in Wales handle annually about 125,000 head of fat cattle. This is a high figure relative to our acreage, and indeed to our resources. They also handle about 1½ million fat sheep and lambs, and 300,000 fat pigs. Apart from that, many thousands of Welsh cattle, sheep, and pigs are sold for breeding or finishing elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, the fat lamb producer of Anglesey will get his ewes from the mainland and not necessarily from Caernarvonshire. The Leicestershire farmer may buy the strong Welsh black store cattle for his richer pastures, while a county like Carmarthen—and we have more than one like it in Wales—is justly famous as a source of young dairy stock. This points the moral, which we must understand in Wales, that our agriculture is not only distinctive, because of natural forces, but that it is linked very closely indeed with the agriculture of the rest of the Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore have a picture of an industry comprising a great many small and medium-sized operators working more often than not in upland country. These are the facts of life in Wales and they are inevitably obliged to make a virtue of geographical and climatic necessity and to concentrate largely on livestock and its products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does Government policy help that kind of industry? What should it do? My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, whose presence here we all welcome, particularly as his better half derives from the very Welsh county of Cardigan, will no doubt refer to various determinants of Government policy, and I should like to refer to one. It is a remarkable fact that a large proportion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
of the support given generally to agriculture in the United Kingdom—quite £100 million or more—is given in the form of direct grants to encourage efficient production, to assist in physical improvements, and also to give special help to the small farmer and to hill and upland farmers. In a real sense, generally agricultural policy helps the Principality perhaps more than any other part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, there are 17 items on the list of relevant production grants approved as a result of the Price Review. I think we are all very glad that over the past year these items, costing about £9 million in benefit to Wales, have included fertility subsidies, livestock subsidies for calves of hill stock, drainage grants, silo subsidies, and also, perhaps more important, looking to the future and bearing in mind what I had to say about the structure of the industry in Wales, the Small Farmer Scheme which my right hon. Friend proposes to extend and reshape to give greater value both to the participating farmer, especially in a country like Wales, and to the country's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only are we in Wales encouraged in short and medium term activity of the type that I have described, but we are also substantially encouraged in the longer-term activities by longer-term grants. These include the Farm Improvement Scheme and the rehabilitation of hill and livestock rearing land. Under these schemes many farms are being provided with modern buildings and facilities which are basic to modern farming. We would like to see this process intensified and accelerated, and we pay tribute to the way in which the utilities, including nationalised utilities, have assisted in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are particularly glad to see how more widely available in the countryside are those amenities which are often taken for granted in town and city. I am thinking particularly of electricity and water supplies, and also improved access roads which are vital to easier marketing and to social and cultural contact. Depopulation in rural Wales, as elsewhere, is prompted not only by economic necessity. It is due also to a lack of facilities of
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
a social and cultural nature in our villages and in our countryside. We ignore that aspect of the matter at our peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these forms of assistance are vital to the average Welsh farmer, who, as we know, operates under difficult conditions, often battling with excessive rainfall and having to contend with poor soil conditions and awkward contours. Was it not your distinguished father, Lady Megan, who once said that the Welsh farmer ploughs a short furrow on a steep hillside? It is very true of the great majority of Welsh farmers. But they do not plough a lonely furrow. Since 1946–47, since the post-war Labour Government, with a great Minister of Agriculture, Welsh farmers, with their opposite numbers in other parts of the Kingdom, have not been left with their difficulties. They have been assisted, and much of the assistance has been carried on, and will be developed in a new context, by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) referred to the Price Review, as one would have expected. He said that it was not an agreed Review. Neither, of course, were five of the last 10 Price Reviews. He also referred to a section of the farming community, especially in Wales, where the Price Review was received, I will not say with shouts of glee, for no farmer at any time has greeted any Price Review with shouts of glee, and Welsh farmers in particular keep their shouts of glee for the Eisteddfod and other far more entertaining and important occasions—but it is a remarkable fact, for the reasons which I have given, that the Government agriculture policy, including the Price Review, is, I will not say geared to the needs of Welsh farming, but is more attuned and helpful to them. For that reason, as I think my right hon. Friend would agree, Welsh farmers have given him a friendly and appreciative reception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we might look briefly at the impact of the last Price Review on Welsh agriculture. There were one or two things which perhaps the hon. Member for Hereford had no time to mention. He did not mention the hill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
cow subsidy which has gone up £1 per animal and, at £13, is the highest yet. There was nothing about that on the posters, by the way. The hon. Gentleman did not mention the very useful concession with regard to the maximum stocking ratio which is helpful to small operators such as we have in Wales. The ratio is to be raised from one cow per six acres to one cow per five acres. As to the Welsh hill sheep farmers, there is the removal of uncertainty which formerly beset hill sheep subsidy payments. There is now an assurance of a flat rate subsidy of 18s. per ewe or shearling in a full rate flock, and 9s. otherwise, instead of a varying payment, averaging 9s. 6d. per animal over the past five years, and sometimes no payment at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the new calf subsidy, which will benefit stock rearers of the type we have in Wales, and which will do what the hon. Gentleman wanted to see happening—augment our home beef supplies. That is the way to do it and that is part of the medium-term policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are changes in the winter keep subsidy, very acceptable to farmers of the kind which I have in my constituency in Caernarvonshire. There is especially the change from an acreage basis to headage. A moment's thought will show that in itself this is a great help to the type of farmer we have in Wales. Finally, there is the much-maligned increase of 1d. on milk. I will say no more about that, except that Welsh dairy farmers are increasingly aware of the danger which bigger increases in this direction may have in over-production and a lower pool price. We must step warily in these matters, and consider all the factors that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government policy, as explained in the White Paper, seeks to promote co-operation among small farmers such as we have in so great numbers in Wales. The hon. Member for Hereford raised the question of amalgamation. I think he will find his answer in the very paragraph of the White Paper to which he referred. Perhaps he did not read it all. Paragraph 12 of the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government consider that there should be arrangements to encourage on a voluntary basis the amalgamation of such land into viable and well equipped holdings."</p></blockquote>
There is no suggestion of bulldozing or undue compulsion. In due course there
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
will be properly considered proposals whereby it will be made possible, and attractive, for the smaller units to come together to provide a rewarding livelihood for those who work so hard in this difficult territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, Lady Megan, that you will allow me to say a word about forestry which is, indeed, part of the agriculture industry, and the new arrangements whereby we in Wales have now a much stronger voice in the development of this important industry in the Principality. The hon. Member for Hereford seemed to suggest the other day that the new arrangements were somewhat less favourable to Wales than the old ones. I am sure that, upon reflection, the hon. Gentleman will not continue to think in that way. First, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now one of the three forestry Ministers. Previously there were two, one for Scotland and one for England and Wales. I am sure that no hon. Member would wish to go back to the old arrangement and abolish the designation of my right hon. Friend as Forestry Minister for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, while the directorates in Wales and Scotland are abolished, nevertheless the senior executive officer for Wales, as in Scotland, is appointed and will be the direct official adviser to the Secretary of State as the Minister for Forestry. There was no such link under the old arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not include any reference to forestry in my speech and I should therefore like now to say that my criticism of the new set-up, which still remains, is that the directorate as such is done away with and members on the National Committee in Wales have been removed. On the National Committee we now have only officials. I regret that very much, and I think that in the long run it will lead to greater direction from London, in spite of what the Minister has said about the obvious responsibility of his right hon. Friend. I do not recommend and I do not like the present set-up. Naturally we shall look to see how it works, but I am fearful about it, and I said so in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that in an arrangement such as this we would wish to move together. I hope this is not a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
real point of dispute. The National Committees will be preserved. Regarding Welsh representation on the Commission, apart from the official level, there will most certainly be Welsh representation on the deliberative level. Finally, I would add that although the directorates are abolished, the North and Mid-Wales Conservancy at last has been moved across the border from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth. Both conservancies are now in Wales and linked by an executive officer. Incidentally—we are discussing the problems of rural Wales—the movement of the North and Mid-Wales Conservancy to Aberystwyth will add to the stock of industry which is suitable to that town. It will mean the movement of about 20 staff members and their families over the next 12 months or so, and that is a substantial and helpful gesture to a town in Mid-Wales which needs to be strengthened and supported on proper industrial lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future of forestry depends to a large measure on the availability of land. My right hon. Friend is very anxious to see that the claims of forestry do not clash unduly with the claims of farming, especially of upland farming, and the sheep-rearing industry. I mentioned earlier that there are nearly 500,000 acres of common land in Wales. This is a very large proportion of the agricultural territory. There is an urgent need that it should be put to the very best use, whether this lies in agriculture, recreation and building of all sorts or in afforestattion. The first and essential stage is to ascertain the rights of common. To this end the Government are promoting legislation in the form of the Commons Registration Bill, a Measure which I think we all support whole-heartedly. There is a very strong Welsh interest in this. We are involved in this Bill with the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources. This Measure, and those which will result from it, will bring very great gains to Wales, expanding its supply of land of all types. Afforestation may well benefit as much as any other need from the mobilisation of this common land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with what I hope is a fail picture of the position and prospects of Welsh agriculture. Certainly it has its problems; it always has had them. Here is a hard-working but adaptable com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
munity, having to struggle against natural forces and perhaps having to put in more hours than its colleagues in other more favourable parts of the country, although all small farmers everywhere work pretty hard. It is a community which is deeply interested in automation and mechanisation. In Wales automation has proceeded very far. It is a community which is showing an increased interest in the rewards which can be obtained from keeping proper records. May I say how much we hope that the average Welsh farmer will increasingly use proper and accurate records both in respect of financial matters and on the operational side of his business. It is a community, despite what the hon. Member for Hereford has said about the reception of the Price Review, which is steadily becoming more viable and more confident of its future. I have no hesitation in saying that, given leadership from my right hon. Friend and the policy of the Government, the economic and social place of the Welsh farmer will be assured and firm in the Principality and the Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Emlyn Hooson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was born and brought up on a farm in the Vale of Clwyd. It was a 100-acre farm and in many ways a typically Welsh family farm. It was untypical in the sense that it consisted of particularly good land. It had been farmed by members of my family for a long time. It is still farmed by my younger brother. I remember that when I was a boy the farms around us were some of the best in the Vale of Clwyd and each supported a thriving family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister of State was referring to amalgamations this was brought back to my mind. We often get amalgamations of holdings which are not viable but also, and indeed, very often we have amalgamations of holding which are entirely viable. This creates a very serious problem. In the Vale of Clwyd at present, several farms which I remember as a boy as being among the best in the valley are now all farmed as one farm. I can think of six of them all farmed by the same man who bought the estate. Least one of them was under 160 acres, the largest, I think, was 400 acres. The landlord bought the estate years ago. Thereafter tenancies were not renewed on death. The separate farms were eventually all amalgamated and are now farmed as one farm. I hasten to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
add that they are farmed efficiently, and in this case by a manager who was a fellow agriculture student of mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this type of amalgamation creates serious social, cultural as well as economic problems. These farms used to support six relatively prosperous families who were the backbone of the social life of the community. They were all Welsh-speaking farms, so to speak, and the families who farmed them contributed a great deal to the social life of the area. In most instances some of the sons stayed on the farms, while others went into the professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that when I was a boy these farms used to employ a number of farm workers and paid the best wages in the valley. They have now all been amalgamated into one farm and it is much to be regretted. I do not blame the landlord; it is not unnatural that he should not feel the same social responsibilities as some might have done. We have seen this sort of thing happen in other parts of the country. As landlords have increasingly become interested in farming their land, no doubt because they have considered that they can get a better income from it, particularly if they amalgamate several farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that it is right for any Government to adopt a completely 
	<i>laissez faire</i> attitude towards the amalgamation of farms. It is all very well to say that such amalgamations are justified where farms are not viable economic units, but as often as not it is not the nonviable units that are amalgamated. When a man wants land to enlarge his own holding he often looks for a large farm to add to his own. It is possible these days for a skilled farmer to tell, within a few hundred pounds, what income he will get from any farm. He can calculate how much he can afford to pay for, say a 200 acre farm to amalgamate with his existing 300 acre farm, by calculating labour costs and the price of additional machinery and so on. The man who is already established in fanning can afford to pay more for additional land than the man who is just starting out because the overheads of the former are spread out over a larger turnover. For this reason the established farmer seeking to expand is partly responsible for increasing the price of agricultural land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
I think that the State has a duty to step in in these circumstances. Consider the 1947 and 1957 Acts. We all pay lip service to them. We speak of how the landlord-tenant relationship has altered. We refer to the control exercised over the Forestry Commission in regard to the planting of trees on the land the Commission purchases. Incidentally, the same restriction should apply to private syndicates which purchase farms for tree planting. I see no reason why any Government of whatever complexion should not have the right to say, bearing in mind the economic, social and cultural factors, whether or not amalgamations should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to look at this issue afresh. Of the farms I mentioned not one is now worth less than £50,000. I know from experience that each one could provide a family with a very good livelihood indeed. This shows that we are not talking about the amalgamation of nonviable economic units. It is ludicrous to allow amalgamation of this type.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our agriculture policy we have become rather obsessed with the problems of structure. What is the optimum structure of any farm is difficult to say because it depends on many variants. It depends on the seasons, the supply and demand situation and so on. I know many small farms which the economists would say are non-viable economic units but which are, in fact, extremely viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are in my County of Montgomery a larger number of smallholdings than in any other part of Wales, probably in any other part of the United Kingdom. When a smallholder applies for another holding he must disclose to the appropriate committee his capital, income and other details. We know, therefore, that it is not true to say that these smallholdings are non-viable. I agree that the men who run them work extremely hard and put in long hours, but they are prepared to do that. I feel that our obsession with problems of structure often distracts us from the real issues confronting the farming industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worth the Government looking at the question of the future form of land tenure in this country. Over the years we have had a landlord-tenant relationship which, in many respects, is now gradually breaking up. It had advantages and disadvantages. Among the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
advantages, it enabled the tenant to put all his capital into the farm while the landlord in partnership provided the fixed capital for the land. It is now virtually impossible for a young man to rent a farm. The rents demanded are often far too high for him, and when I say "high" I mean that rents these days tend to be based on the capital value of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a man undertakes responsibility to a bank or to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to pay a high interest rate he has in mind the fact that, certainly since the war, land has appreciated in value. Therefore, although he may take on a heavy yearly responsibility, he is fortified in the knowledge that, all things being equal, the value of his land is likely to rise. In the case of a tenant who is asked to pay a very high rent, the same does not apply. He has no benefit from capital appreciation in the land and is, therefore, unable to pay the same annual outgoings as the owner occupier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have suggested in a policy document which I drew up for mid-Wales that if there were set up a Welsh rural development corporation it might, in certain circumstances, act as a landlord. It might deal with marginal and, perhaps, hill farms, and ensure that a certain proportion of farms are available to rent to young men who are starting out in agriculture. I see no reason why the State should not act as a landlord in a restricted way through a corporation of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some of the more general aspects of agriculture, particularly since the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is here. We welcome him to the Committee. Welsh farmers are particularly concerned—as are their brethren in England and Scotland—about our long-term agriculture policy; in other words, to what ends is our policy for agriculture being shaped? This is a serious problem and the industry wants to know what part agriculture is to play in the national picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make up our minds on this issue. I read last week, for example, that Cuban eggs have been imported into this country cheaply. Are we to allow importations of this kind in any circum-
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
stances or, if not, in what circumstances? I have always taken the view that this country should follow a policy of high farming because I realise that as more countries become more developed and sophisticated they demand more sophisticated temperate foods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember, for example, that since the war the Japanese, with their huge industrial development, have developed much more sophisticated tastes. They are eating far more meat than they used to. The fact that Argentine beef has been diverted to European markets so much in the last few years is a harbinger of things to come. In our shops today British housewives are finding that they must pay more for beef, that important part of our traditional menu. The writing is on the wall and we should take note. We are having to pay more for products such as beef because of the increasing demand for them and the greater pressure on the world's available food resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, I am absolutely convinced that in the long term we must develop our food resources to the utmost. I have never been convinced that we should hand over large tracts of our agricultural land for re-afforestation and so on. There is certainly a place for re-afforestation, but only in harmony with agriculture, and we would be making a mistake to take a short-term view of this matter. Agriculture is so important to us that we should have a managed market for it. However much we criticise the form of managed market adopted in the European countries of the Common Market, such a policy is right in the long term because no country in Western Europe can afford to neglect or risk its agriculture. I am not accusing the present Government or their predecessors of neglecting our agriculture, but merely advocating that we must look more in the direction of a managed market in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to delay the Committee but, as the Minister is present, I must mention the technical revolution which has been, and is, taking place in agriculture. We are fond of comparing production figures today with output in 1939, which results in our concluding that food production has greatly increased. However, it is an invalid comparison. It will be remembered that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
in 1918 and 1921, for example, food production in Britain was very much higher than in 1939. Although 1939 might be a convenient year to take when making comparisons of this sort, as well as being the first year of the war it was also the end of a period of depression and the recovery in agriculture. It is, therefore, completely invalid to compare production figures today with those of 1939.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one compares output in Wales, particularly the food production figures for last year, with production in 1921 or 1918 one finds that production has not increased very much in the Principality. Food production per man has increased, but that is because of the technical revolution that has taken place in farming. That revolution has particularly affected the arable areas and it is only now that other areas are beginning to feel the full force of the impact. The great economic pressure on the small Welsh farmer to increase his income—and we know from our friends in farming how on even small hill farms the farmers tend to go in for a few acres of seed potatoes and so on to increase their incomes—is resulting in a willingness to undertake great technical changes, particularly in sheep and cattle breeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the help which the Government can give in this direction, remembering that education is particularly very necessary. I remind the Minister of his past eloquent advocacy of a Welsh agricultural college. I hope that now he is in office he has not forgotten that advocacy when he was in Opposition. There are today four farm institutes in Wales for 13 counties. In your native county of Caernarvon, Lady Megan, there is a farm institute which is at present attended by 29 students, 28 from Caernarvon and one from Kent. There is not one student from Anglesey or Merioneth. This illustrates a rather parochial situation which is regrettable. Facilities for obtaining education in agriculture in Wales have decreased compared with pre-war. My father took a diploma in agriculture, as did many of his fellow farmers, at Bangor; others did the same course at Aberystwyth. It is no longer possible for people in that position to take such a diploma—training not because they want to be scientists but because they want further practical
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
education in this important subject—and there is a crying need for a college at Aberystwyth to cater in this respect for the whole of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is crucial to all this that the consideration must cover the future of farm institutes as well as a college of a type which the hon. and learned Member and I have in mind. We ought possibly to make some sort of interim statement reasonably soon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two further small but important points which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention. Montgomeryshire benefited a great deal from road improvement grants made under the 1955 Act. Nevertheless there were many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
hundreds of roads which were not dealt with under that Act but which could be dealt with if grants were now made available. Has this problem been looked at anew and is there any chance of a similar Measure being passed or similar provisions being made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of electricity, which has already been mentioned, I ask the Minister of State and the Minister of Agriculture to try to bring influence to bear on the electricity authorities, because the people at the end of the line can least afford to pay the very high charges now asked of them for connection. They waited many years without electricity, and whereas people in the more favoured areas paid a very small fee for connection, those who have had to wait such a long time are now asked to pay the highest charges and they simply cannot afford them. I hope that something can be done to assist these people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. W. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have chosen agriculture as the subject for today's debate because it should not be forgotten that despite the fact that Britain generated the Industrial Revolution, agriculture is still the largest industry in this country. More people are engaged in it than in any other industry. I very much hope that it will remain the largest industry because it is without question a sound economic policy for any nation to preserve a perfect balance between urbanisation and agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As other hon. Members have said, I am sure that we all appreciate the fact that the Minister of Agriculture has graced our meeting with his presence. I hold him in the highest esteem and if I strike, as I may do, a critical note in the course of my remarks it is because of my great faith in him and because I know of his great anxiety to act justly towards all sections of the farming community. I know that the Minister has been criticised by some farmers as a result of the last Price Review. Their method of expressing their disapproval is something which I am sure we all deplore. In trying to force the Minister to give a bigger block grant, they blocked the roads and that is something new for farmers in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's statement made at the time, that with the exception of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
Election Price Review, the bribe Price Review—and how the then Minister of Agriculture was not put in goal I do not know—the last Price Review was by far the best of the eight previous ones. Anyway it was a plus review, which was something new, and this was after only four months of office and after 13 years of Tory misrule which so nearly brought us to bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how the hon. Member can describe this Price Review as a plus review when it was an under-recoupment of £18½ million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. W. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will explain to the hon. Member this algebraic designation of the Price Review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will be the first to acknowledge that agriculture in Wales differs fundamentally from agriculture in England because of our peculiar terrain. The farms in Wales are all small farms and hill farms. This is particularly true of Merioneth which I have the honour to represent. It is a typical Welsh county. Merioneth, including Blaenau Ffestiniog, is a place where Welsh is still spoken and where we give people permission to speak English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to be reassured by the Minister that in future Price Reviews account will be taken of geographical situation, soil, climate and marketing considerations. I believe that this was indicated in the White Paper published earlier this year, and unless I am sadly mistaken we can look forward to future Price Reviews when guarantees will be varied and directed to those areas which are most in need. Such a policy would greatly benefit farmers in Merioneth, because no fewer than 600 holdings in that county—and I ask the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) to note this—are farms of less than 20 acres, while farms of over 150 acres, which are so common in the flat areas of England, number only 87 in that county. This is equally true of Brecon, Radnor, Montgomery and Caernarvonshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been done for hill farmers in the county. The incorporation of the hill sheep subsidy within the ambit of the Review machinery is a wise and logical step. Support from this subsidy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
is fully warranted because, I am told, the quality of the hardy type of Welsh hill ewes is second to none and the end product, the Welsh lamb, is in accordance with popular consumer demand. It is a delicacy greatly sought by the housewives of the Midlands, and I often wish that some Welsh lambs would stroll into our cookhouse in the House of Commons, because I am sure that the last lamb I had here had seen many a summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This same point applies to the hill cow subsidy and when there is a shortage of beef, the Minister is to be congratulated on giving an impetus and confidence to the hill farmer. I am a little worried, however, about the supplemental winter hill scheme and the resultant complete exclusion of or reduced incomes for many farmers in my constituency. There are at least 30 farms in Merioneth, all viable holdings, which this year will be deprived of assistance. Although they had the benefit of assistance in 1964, this year they will receive nothing, and with rising costs they are facing a crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In travelling the country I have also seen examples of many farms where, despite the hill sheep and the hill cow subsidies, there will be a reduction of between £1 and £2 a week in incomes under the new winter keep scheme which is a supplement to the hill sheep and hill cow subsidies. I know of one farmer who faces a reduction of approximately £120 this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like also to stress the plight of the marginal farms. These holdings receive no benefit and they are unfavourably situated at high altitudes. These farms are neither hill farms nor lush lowland farms and they are central to the agricultural pattern of Merioneth. These farmers have to earn their livelihood entirely from milk production and in the most difficult areas, and to obtain some idea of the hill and marginal farm problem in the Principality it should be borne in mind that a quarter of our land is classified as rough grazing land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Price Reviews have tended to apply the criterion of altitude without consideration of other factors. Good examples of this are to be found in Merioneth where on many farms the enclosed land amounts to only 20 per cent. of the farm land, the remainder being composed of "ffridd"
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
and "morfa". I was on one of these "ffriddoedd" last Sunday—and not playing golf. This type of land is very wet and is difficult and costly to cultivate, but I find that under present legislation this land is not now eligible for grant. I am sure that the Minister will make a note of my complaint. I believe that the Minister has caused an inquiry to be made into the problems of marginal farms. I hope that when he is winding up this debate he will say what progress has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of milk production is most important for the County of Merioneth. It is interesting to note that all the milk produced in the county is handled by only two creameries, the C.W.S. at Corwen producing cheese, and Hufenfa Meirion. Perhaps I had better indicate that the latter name means the Meirion Creamery. It is producing at Rhydymain and is sponsored by the farmers of the county. These two creameries employ a considerable number of people and they are situated in mid-Wales were the Welsh Office is strenuously endeavouring to bring in new industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has set his heart on attracting new industries to this part of Wales. He will be very grieved to be told that there is a possibility of reducing the number of employees at these two creameries. The annual meeting of the producers of Hufenfa Meirion was held recently when it was reported that the import of milk last year had gone down by 24 per cent. compared with 1961; it was down to 496,000 gallons. Yet an expensive plant has been installed at this creamery which could easily deal with one million gallons more than it uses at present. I suggest that the Minister of Agriculture should consult with his colleague, the Secretary of State, about the situation of these two creameries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of forestry has been dealt with and although I had intended to say a word or two about it, I shall not do so. I emphasise what was said by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) that it would be a good thing to re-enact the Agriculture (Improvement of Roads) Act because many farmers, particularly in Merioneth, were unable in the allotted period of seven years to take advantage of the Act but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
could now do so if they were given the opportunity. The Act was a great help to farmers in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am absolutely satisfied that the Minister of Agriculture is keenly interested and anxious to lay a firm basis for the future prosperity of agriculture. He must not be dismayed by the reception given to his Price Review. As has been said, if it had been different, farmers would probably have found something to complain about. I am reminded of an incident in a Sunday School in my town. The minister asked the children if there was one thing which God could not do. One child put up his hand and said, "Please the farmers". I do not expect that even the present Minister can please all the farmers. I do not make comparison between him and Lord Williams of Barnburgh, but I am sure that the present Minister is equal to any Minister of Agriculture we have ever had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lady Megan, you and I parted company at about 4 o'clock this morning. Such a remark made by me will not lead to any misunderstanding in this Committee, but, so that there shall not be any misunderstanding elsewhere, I should say that it applies to most of us in this Committee this morning. I congratulate both you as Chairman and other members of the Committee on the alertness they are displaying, having regard to the fact that we were working in the House of Commons into the early hours of this morning. That alertness was demonstrated particularly in the speech of the hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) who, in his customary forceful, objective and delightful way, put forward the case for the farmers of his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee was particularly impressed by the two opening speeches, by the speeches of my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt), who speaks with such authority on these matters, and the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts), who gave us a review of the agricultural situation in Wales which most of us in this Committee will accept. There will be very little disagreement with most of what he said. I am personally delighted that the Minister of Agriculture has been able to find time to come to this Committee. He
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
is a very busy Minister and it is good of him to give us of his time. He is welcome in this Committee, not just because his wife is a Welsh-speaking Welsh woman, but because he is known to us as a personable man who will do everything he possibly can within the limits of the dictates of the Treasury and his Government to help agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that his Price Review has been badly received by the farming community. It is understandable that this should be referred to by the opening speakers in this debate. Most of us have received a document from the National Farmers' Union. That document contains a table showing the range of incomes in a sample of 844 farms in Wales. Does the Minister accept that the table accurately reflects the general income situation of farmers in Wales? It is probably not right to compare incomes as shown in such tables with earnings, but I think it right to compare incomes of farmers with incomes of people who have invested their money in businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On any comparison, if the Minister accepts these figures as a true reflection of the situation, it seems very disturbing. It appears that there is a totally inadequate return for the capital and 1abour involved in farming in Wales. Although the Minister of State quite rightly referred to the better parts of the Price Review, resentment is felt because Her Majesty's Government did not pay full regard to the reasonable expectation that farmers thought they had of an improvement in their earning position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to refer to the Price Review or to any agricultural matters because time is limited, but I wish to follow something which was said by the hon. Member for Merioneth, who is now no longer with us, in reference to marginal land and hill farms. The Minister of State referred to the hill farm ploughing subsidy and to the increase in the subsidy which we all welcome. I think he will agree that one of the problems is reclassification which has excluded many farmers from this subsidy. In the county which he and I represent together, Caernarvonshire, there is a considerable acreage of land which is left out of the scheme although it is of no use other than for livestock rearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look at the way in which the criteria are applied. Is it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
possible for the criteria for classification to be not so rigid but more flexible? As the hon. Member for Merioneth said, proper allowance should be made for local conditions. He mentioned the criterion of elevation. That is something which should be looked at. There is also the insistence that cattle should be kept on the mountains for the full seven-months period. In certain parts of the County of Caernarvon there are very severe conditions. Insistence on cattle remaining on those mountains for the full seven months is too much of an imposition. It demands a very hardy animal. In most cases the animal should not remain on a mountain for more than five months. Will the Minister look at this and see if any assistance can be given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister can answer another point which has not so far been mentioned. It relates to Capital Gains Tax, a matter which we have been debating at length—some would say 
	<i>ad nauseam</i>—in Committee of the House on the Finance Bill. The Minister will know of the debate which took place in relation to owner-occupied farms where the farm is inherited by the son. In North Wales, particularly in the County of Caernarvon, there is a tradition that a son whose expectation is to inherit the farm will work it for his father well into middle age without wages—often with only pocket money—and his reward is succession to that farm. The Minister of State will know of many cases, as I certainly do, of people operating under these conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that as the Finance Bill stands at present, if the farmer dies that farm is subject to Capital Gains Tax. I think the same applies if the farmer retires and the son inherits. I think it was said by one of the Treasury Ministers during a Committee debate on the Finance Bill that he would accept in principle that something should be done in this matter. He would rectify it, or do something about it on the Report stage of the Bill, The Minister of Agriculture will appreciate that this matter is of extreme concern to this type of farmer. If the Minister can do something about it in this Committee today I know that it will be greatly appreciated. I shall not press him further than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
I also wish to refer to flooding. You, Lady Megan, may have received a document from the National Farmers Union referring to flooding in the Severn Valley last winter. Other parts of Wales were also severely damaged, particularly my part of the world, the Conway Valley, and considerable damage was done to farm property. It may be that major imaginative land works are needed. If the Minister cannot answer this question immediately, will he consider the functions of the Ministry and the Government in this problem? One can hardly expect the river authorities to produce extremely expensive works—even though they are necessary—without Government aid. I hope that the Government are in a position to grant aid for necessary schemes to prevent flooding in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I have said something that has caused Ministers to leave. I wanted to ask the Minister a question, but perhaps I can ask it of his hon. Friend instead. I have had correspondence with the Secretary of State on this question, and I hope that he will not mind my raising this, because it is causing considerable concern. It relates to the form of application for the right to extract water, which has to be made under the Water Resources Act, 1963. Before 1st July, all farmers who wish to apply for the right to extract water will have to fill up Form AL5. Unless they complete this form by 30th June, farmers on the hill and marginal farms which over the centuries have used water drawn from wells or from springs for their domestic purposes, will be in breach of the law. Apparently the form has to be accompanied by an ordnance map which the farmers have to produce. This is one of the most complicated forms that I have ever seen. I sometimes have to study complicated legal forms, but I find this one very difficult to understand in parts, and it is too much to expect a small farmer, who does not usually do this form of clerical work, to be able to complete the form with the accuracy that it demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been told that in the Gwynedd River Authority area there are about 500 farmers who will be required to complete the form by 30th June. On 10th June, only 50 had done so. It may well be that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
by 30th June a number of farmers will not have managed to complete the form, or that few have completed it properly. I got in touch with the Secretary of State on this matter. I first wrote to the Minister of Agriculture. I received a letter saying that on consideration it was thought that it was a matter for the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. I then received a letter saying that it was a matter for the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Wales. Anyhow, eventually I received what one would expect, a charming letter from the right hon. Gentleman who pointed out the extreme difficulties, which I appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the duty under this Act to ask for the particulars which are in this document. I think that it would be very difficult to simplify the document within the requisite time. There is a three months requirement from April, and therefore by statute the period expires on 30th June. I accept all these things, but I ask the Government to say that if by any chance there is an administrative breakdown because of the difficulties, and farmers are not able to complete the forms, the matter will be looked at after 30th June so that some remedy, even if it is by legislation, which I am sure will be non-controversial, can be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that an application is to be made to the right hon. Gentleman for the Gwynedd River Authority to be an excepted area, because it seems that one does not need these applications in that area where there is an abundant water supply. This application cannot be put in before 30th June, and I hope that no farmers will be prejudiced by the absence of a legal requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Idwal Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no industry which is more heterogeneous than agriculture. This is particularly true of agriculture in Wales where one-third of our land is more than 1,000 ft. high, where one-third of our land is classified as rough pasture, and where so much of our land consists of mountain country. This is what makes it very difficult to draft out one scheme which can be satisfactory to all farmers in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, of course, easy to draw an overall picture of the Principality. For example,
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
we know that most of our farmers depend for their income on cattle and sheep, and we know at the same time that more than 50 per cent. of the incomes are derived from cattle and dairy produce, about 20 per cent. from sheep and wool, and only about 8 per cent. from crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a general picture will not help us very much, because it has the inadequacy of averages. For example, we know that in Anglesey, Pembrokeshire and in North-East Wales in Flintshire, there is a very dense cattle population per 100 acres. In Merionethshire, on the other hand, the cattle population per 100 acres is very low, and much below the average per 100 acres for the country. Consequently, the only way of getting a real grasp of the problem in Wales is to break up the industry into its component parts, and that is what I should like to do for a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we examine the problem geographically we find that there are four main types of farms in the Principality. First, there is the lowland farm in the broad lowlands and the lower reaches of our valleys. There the soils are rich, communications are easy, and markets are easily accessible with the result that conditions for farming are relatively satisfactory. Dairy produce is the main product of these farms and the income is almost entirely from dairy produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we move from the lowland areas up the valleys, we come to another type of farm where the land is rather higher and the soils are quite good, but here we find an element of mixed farming. Milk production is still the most important factor, but there is also cattle fattening. Milk, however, is the predominant source of income. That is the second type of farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we move further up the river valleys we come to upland and mountain land, and it is here that we find two types of hill farm. There are the hill farms on the better soils, and there are those on very poor soils. I believe it is here that we find the real problems facing our Welsh farms. These farms are in very remote districts. Communications are difficult and they are very far from markets. That being so, they are up against the geographical difficulties as well as the difficulties of soil and climate. Consequently, these farmers have to look to more than one or two farm products
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
for their income. The nature of the farm becomes more mixed than elsewhere. While a certain amount of milk is produced, we find that the farmers are very dependent on sheep and cattle, and to some extent on poultry, for their income. This is the mixed type of farm, and nowhere do we find the incomes of these farms to be very satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question—and I think that this is the fundamental problem—is, what can we do in Wales to improve the farms in these parts of the Principality? What can we do to assist the farms in these remote parts of Wales? It would be a simple solution to allow the area to become one huge ranch, and indeed some people are suggesting that, but I submit that it will not do because we are dealing with what we call in Welsh cefn gwlad. A literal translation of this expression would not make sense, but the spirit of the translation is that here we have what we may call the "heart of the countryside", and it is here that we find a certain type of Welsh culture which is incomparable to any part of the world. It is here that we have the ordinary working man on the farm taking a keen interest in literature, in prose and in poetry. To allow this area to become one huge ranch would destroy one of the richest inheritances of our country. The task, therefore, is to do something to re-invigorate farms of this type so as to provide these people with a satisfactory income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are obviously two ways of looking at the problem. There is the long-term problem to which I shall refer in a moment, but in the meantime these people must be helped to carry on because we do not want these areas to lose the fine type of people who live there. Thus we have the short-term problem of what we can do immediately, and we also have the problem of laying down a long-term policy, something which we expect to be achieved in the longer period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the short-term policy, I think that the Minister is right in the middle of the road. In his Price Review he has made it quite clear that he wants to assist those farmers who are in the greatest need of assistance and help. He is giving assistance to the hill farmer in his production of store cattle and sheep. The hill farm ewe will have a subsidy of 18s. and the hill
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
cow will have a subsidy of £2 13s. In addition we have the small farmer scheme which will also help these people, so I am satisfied that in the short term the Minister is on the right lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been pointed out this morning, there are, however, certain farmers who maintain that they will lose as a result of the new arrangement. They argue that although hitherto they qualified for the hill cow subsidy, they no longer do so because of the new classification. These are the farmers on the "ffriddoedd". I do not know whether the nearest English word is "alp" but it means uncultivated land, or semi-cultivated land, on relatively gentle slopes between 500 and 900 feet high. These people say that they are not getting a square deal as a result of the review and I would like the Minister's observations on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we come to what we call the long-term policy, and here there is a question of amalgamation to which references have been made. I am glad that the Minister has dismissed the idea of compulsory amalgamation. I think that he is right. Amalgamation must come from the wish and consent of the people. There are several forms which might be examined, analysed and considered. It does not follow that a type of amalgamation successful in one area would be the most suitable type for another area. We may think of that type of amalgamation known as a consortium, where a group of farms come together to plan the whole operation, invest their capital, acquire the most modern machinery and so increase both production and their incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, it is a question of how to organise a farm or a group of farms, how to decide on production structure and how to organise management and the marketing of products. Those are fundamental problems. Although it is estimated that scientific knowledge should be available to farmers in all parts of Wales, I think we also require what is of equal importance, namely, knowledge of farm management, an economic approach to output, and a scientific method of the marketing of produce. Therefore, we shall not solve the problems which arise in difficult farms in Wales unless we improve our system of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
At present we have universal and secondary education in Wales. Our secondary schools will provide the future students of our educational establishments. Some will go to university to obtain a degree in agriculture, which is quite right. There is another type of pupil who will go to the farm institute in order to obtain a 12-month course in general farm work. But there is a course which, I am sorry to say, is missing in Wales—the diploma course in dairying and agriculture and in farm organisation. It is wrong to expect the universities to provide diploma courses. That is not their function. Nor is it the function of the farm institutes. True, there are farm institutes which do provide such courses, and I wish to pay regard to those institutions. At the same time, I wish to state that it is not their function. The function of the farm institutes is to provide a 12-month general training in farm work. The university should provide a degree in agriculture. Today in Wales we require a college where diploma courses will be provided. There are three colleges where these may be obtained in Scotland and there are seven in England, but not one in Wales. This middle tier in education is missing. We have no agricultural college in Wales at the present time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A diploma course such as that to which I refer should have a bias towards Welsh farming so that those who possess the diploma will be able to say that they are specialists in the problems of Welsh farming. Such people could assist those farmers on the spot to organise their farms along sound productive lines. They could help to manage farms and to market the goods. On these lines I think it would be possible to re-invigorate rural Wales and help to maintain that life in the country which is so necessary to its future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
ferred to already by the right hon. and learned Member for Conway (Mr. Peter Thomas). It is an important point. Under the Water Resources Act, 1963, as from 1st July of this year the abstraction of water, with one or two exceptions, will be illegal if not done under licence. A large number of farmers in Wales will be deprived of their basic rights with regard to water if they do not obtain a licence by 1st July. These rights are extremely important. The right hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that in the main the farmers are entitled, as of right, to such licences, but they are required to complete and forward the necessary form to the authorities by 30th June. The form is very involved; I do not think anyone would dispute that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory leaflet was late in being published. That may well be no one's fault. The Regulations came into operation on 1st April and it was not until several weeks later after the Statutory Instrument came into operation that any explanatory leaflets were available to members of the farming community. As the Regulations stand, there is no discretion with relation to the alteration of the date of 1st July as the datum line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a discretion with respect to the river authorities. In the ordinary way such an authority has until 31st December to deal with applications, that is, a period of six months, and there is power to extend that period by agreement. The question of appeals dealt with under Regulation 12 includes the power to extend the time by a month, or within such longer period as the Minister may at any time allow. There is therefore an element of discretion with regard to the datum line in respect of the decisions to be made by the river authorities regarding applications for licences and also in relation to the time for appeals. It is most unfortunate that there is no manoeuvrability whatever in relation to this date of 1st July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the farming community have only a week in which to complete this involved form and send it in, I suggest that the Minister should advise the river authorities to be extremely tolerant about attempts to obtain additional information. I am certain that if the Minister does so, the difficulties may be overcome. I would emphasise that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

this matter relates not only to Gwynedd, but to the whole of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. G. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one would expect in the Welsh Grand Committee, we have had a most interesting and wide-ranging debate on this subject. It has been rightly said that agriculture lies very close to the centre of politics. For that reason it is very easy to make facile and sometimes not very profound party political points about it. The interesting thing, when one looks back over the last 20 years, is that there has been more real basic continuity of policy by succeeding Governments in relation to agriculture than any other subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said earlier that a great deal had been done by the previous Labour Government, when Lord Williams of Barnburgh was the Minister, in the shape of the Agriculture Act and Hill Farming Act of 1947, which had helped farmers, and particularly Welsh farmers. I entirely agree. I am sure that the Minister of State, in fairness, would also agree that a great deal of that resulted from the rethinking on agriculture which took place during the latter years of the Coalition Government, particularly in 1944 and 1945. It is no discredit to the Measures introduced then that they were introduced at a time when there was the number one seller's market of all time so far as agriculture was concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During their period of office the Conservative Governments—through they were given little credit for this by right hon. and hon. Members opposite during the last Election campaign—did a great deal for agriculture. I do not wish to go through a catalogue of enactments, but I may point to just a few. There was the introduction of deficiency payments in 1953 and the long-term guarantees in the Act of 1957. Last, but not least, there was the Agriculture (Small Farmers) Act of 1959. That is a matter of particular importance to Wales, a country of small farmers, and I intend to refer to it again later in my speech.

I expected, as I suppose we all did, that references would be made to the Price Review which, to use a colloquialism, has been a hard-flogged issue. I do not wish to say any more about it than is necessary, and I might preface
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
my remarks by saying that I am much in agreement with what was said in the House by my right hon. Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Sir M. Redmayne) that we should consider the possibility of avoiding this annual "dogfight" and at least give a trial to reviews extending over a period of three or five years. However, that is not the system prevailing at present, and so I must say a few words on the present Price Review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be the last person to suggest that the Price Reviews of the former Conservative Governments were all the last word in perfection. If I did, I would be an arrant humbug. My very first speech in this Committee in 1960 very shortly after its inception, included a certain measure of criticism of the Price Review of that year. In that respect I felt some sympathy for the hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) today. I well remember that at that time a very distinguished member of the Committee referred to my speech as one of modified rapture for that Price Review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the present Price Review has been one of the worst received for many years. I do not think one can write that off entirely as being due to political bias on the part of farmers. My experience of them goes back for a long time and I have found that they are very non-political in this respect. If there is an unpopular Price Review, as I know to my cost, farmers are prepared to give the sitting Member "stick", whatever may be his political party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it not inappropriate to make this comment about some of the earlier Reviews. It has been said that a number of them over the last 10 years were not agreed. By way of justification of the particularly unpopular Review of 1960, may I say that at that time we were faced with the constant danger of overproduction of milk. That was the reason why that Review was a severe one, I think unduly so. It must be remembered, in fairness, that the Minister at that time made clear that it was up to the industry itself to arrive if possible, at some scheme which would avoid this danger. It was on that understanding that an increase was made in the price of milk in 1961, but unfortunately no scheme was developed and there had to be a later reduction in the price of milk.

12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it is said, most unjustly, that it was electioneering only that brought about a favourable Review in 1964 I think I can do no better than refer to what was said in the Report which, after all, was issued under the aegis of the present Secretary of State. I am, of course, not so naïve as not to realise that it is to a Government's advantage if it can face an Election with a favourable Price Review behind it, but this is what the Report says:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over the last two years the trend has been for milk production, which had previously been rising much faster than the consumption of liquid milk, to come into better balance with the demand. This made it possible to bring about a much needed improvement in the incomes of milk producers. The guaranteed price was increased by 2¼d per gallon … "</p></blockquote>
That was the explanation given at the time of that Price Review. The present increase in the price of milk cannot, on any interpretation of figures, cope with the increase in prices that has taken place. This award has taken place in the face of the highest annual increase in costs for eight years and there is a grave danger of a substantial reduction in the dairy herd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember an amusing speech made in 1960 by the hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones), who so frequently delights us with his remarks. When dealing with the danger to the pig herd he said that it had been driven over the precipice like the Gadarene swine of old, driven, not by the the devil but by the Minister of Agriculture. It is the dairy herd which now looks like going over the precipice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back now to the Small Farmer Scheme, as I promised I would. This was probably one of the most imaginative achievements of the former Government. Its success has been referred to in detail and I do not propose to repeat the figures, except to say that paragraphs 261–2 of the Report state, to put the matter in a nut-shell, that the estimated total value of the grants committed for approved plans was about £5,800,000, of which about £4,600,000 had been paid. Practically all of this took place in the period of the former Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parties are basically united on the general basis of the Scheme. It was
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
established to deal with farms of between 20 and 100 acres in area. The N.F.U. at one stage suggested that the acreages should be extended at both ends, from 15 to 150 acres, and I believe that the former Government rightly rejected that suggestion. After all, if one goes below 20 acres one is in danger of dealing with farms that are not economically viable, while if one goes beyond 100 acres one is going outside the realm of farms which are, in any real sense, small farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise the present schemes which have been put forward to aid small farmers. Indeed, I compliment the Government on them and suggest that they are the only satisfactory parts of the Review. My only criticism, which is a basic one, is that the general awards are so parsimonious and small farmers will be so hard hit that many of them may have to go out of business before any advantages can accrue to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various remarks have been made about general agricultural policy and I do not have time to go into them all. I will not deal with import policy, which was mentioned by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson), except to say that I was astonished at some of the protectionist views which he expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forestry is an allied industry to agriculture, although at times there has been friction between them. It is important that the private sector of forestry should not be neglected. There is always the danger of that happening. There is of course, a big drift from the land in Wales, as in all industrialised countries, and some pertinent figures were given before the Election, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph) in the Welsh Grand Committee. He pointed out, that whereas there were only 70 pick-up balers in Wales in 1948, there were 11,000 by 1964. Paragraph 250 of the Report also gives some interesting figures about the mechanisation of Welsh farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that forestry can to some extent take care of the labour force which is inevitably released from the farms in these circumstances, but that is not so. An investigation of the figures shows that only about 4 per cent of the labour force so released is re-employed in forestry. We must, therefore, look
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
to industries ancillary to forestry to help and in this connection, if I have time, I will return to the subject of the Rural Industries Bureau because this matter was raised in this Committee towards the end of the last Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I associate myself with the remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery and the hon. and learned Member for Cardigan (Mr. Bowen) about an agriculture college. The hon. and learned Member for Cardigan and I have been raising this point one after the other since 1962. When the matter was last raised, before the Election, we were told that the whole question of agriculture education below degree level was under review by the Welsh Joint Education Committee. We were told this morning that the project was "attaining new life". It is a rather slow resurrection and it is about time that a decision was taken. There is strong feeling on this issue, as I know from correspondence with my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Agriculture (Improvement of Roads) Act, 1955 has been referred to by a number of hon. Members and it was indeed a valuable Act. It is to be regretted that it in effect came to an end in December, 1962. Its non-renewal was much criticised by the party opposite at the time. Hon. Gentlemen opposite now have their chance to put the matter right, and I hope they will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rural Industries Bureau was discussed in this Committee before the Election and my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East agreed, as a result of approaches made by the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Cledwyn Hughes) and myself, to have another look at this matter and to consider the possibility of having a sort of inventory of rural industries. I understand from what was said at the last Welsh Grand Committee before the Election that meetings on this subject were going to take place between the then Ministry of Welsh Affairs and representatives of the Bureau. Has the Minister anything to tell us on this subject?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last subject with which I will deal, since time is short, is that of electricity. I associate myself with the remarks of other hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) and am wondering if a
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
possible solution is this. It comes from a Liberal source, but I am prepared to accept it, wherever it comes from. It is that something in the nature of a subsidy, forming part of the global sum allocated in the Price Review, might be given to assist farms which seem otherwise doomed to remain in outer darkness—those at the end of the line, as hon. Members have put it, and those which are in isolated pockets. I have many such farms in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the lack of time prevents me from dealing with many other matters which have been raised. I conclude by saying that we are dealing with a very rich inheritance indeed—and something which unites Welsh people of all political parties. We must bear in mind that this is not merely a question of maintaining the prosperity of an agricultural area but of saving a language, a tradition and a way of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Fred Peart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed a privilege to address the Welsh Grand Committee. I am a complete stranger here, except that coming from Cumbria there is some relationship with Cambria and that while I have heard the arguments put to the Committee from the point of view of the Welsh farmers, those arguments are in many ways very similar to those which are raised about the problems of the farmers in my county of Cumberland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been pleased to attend the Welsh Grand Committee and I have found the discussion extremely stimulating. I get the strange impression—I may be wrong—that the Tories in this Committee become more Liberal and that—having heard the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson)—the Liberals become more Tory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate today on the problems of agriculture has seemed of a higher standard—and I am not speaking disrespectfully of my colleagues who represent other parts of the country—that the debates for some time past which have taken place on this subject on the Floor of the House. I therefore pay tribute to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for their contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister of State spoke with eloquence and precision as he analysed some of the main problems
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
of Welsh agriculture. The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) spoke with dignity and, although I may disagree with him on some points, I have tried to impress on my critics in the country, including the farmers' unions, that if we disagree we must disagree with dignity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My visit to Wales quite recently confirmed that view and I must say that I was treated with great courtesy. At all the meetings the Welsh farmers put their points of view—and there are differences of view among the members of the Welsh farming community—and I know that they forcibly argue their case, though with great courtesy, which must be a lesson to other people. That is not to say that we should not disagree. This morning I was interested in the remarks of the hon. Member for Denbigh (Mr. Morgan), particularly when he talked about the contribution of his party, in relation to the evolution of policy after the war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the 1947 Act, to which he paid tribute, I was then a humble Parliamentary Private Secretary sitting behind my Minister. I recall that the Conservatives voted against Part I of that Measure, Indeed, it was because of our initiative, and not because of the formulation of policy during the war—although my Minister at the time had also been a Minister in the earlier Agriculture Department—that the Measure reached the Statute Book. We take full responsibility for the 1947 Act; we believe that it has been weakened in many respects and that the 1957 Act legislated for declining incomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the arguments which have been adduced about the Price Review, for the 1957 Act resulted in Conservative Administrations introducing "minus" Reviews. Whatever arguments may be adduced against the latest Review, it is a "plus" Review. I may be making a debating point but, in view of what has been said, it is right that I should do so, for we are politicians. The right hon. and learned Member for Conway (Mr. Peter Thomas) paid me a nice tribute, for which I thank him, but he is a politician and I do not object if he criticises the Government. Wales
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
has a great tradition for argument and invective. I hope that it will keep it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not be mealy-mouthed this morning when we are arguing about political issues. There is common agreement that we must work out a long-term policy for agriculture. There are, of course, still fundamental differences of approach, but although there may be arguments about the Price Review I believe that in the end the future of agriculture rests within the framework of a planned economy not for farming alone but for our whole economic life in the best constructive sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to hear the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson), representing the former disciples of 
	<i>laissez faire,</i> pleading this morning for more State intervention. I was glad also to hear the great tributes paid by spokesmen of the Tory Party to the success of the nationalised electricity industry. I only wish that their own Leader had spoken like that instead of making attacks on nationalisation over a long period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe in the argument put forward by the right hon. Gentleman. I was speaking particularly of the S.W.E.B.

Gentleman will not take the argument too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The electricity industry has revolutionised the countryside. In my own rural district we would not have had electricity installed in farms to the extent we have if it had not been for this great public enterprise. I pay tribute to it today, and it is good to see the evolution in the Tory approach in that those hon. Members opposite who wish well to the farming community can pay tribute to a nationalised industry. I might also refer to the hon. Member's remarks about going into Europe and a managed market but it would be unfair for me to get involved in that subject now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
The beef scheme has been put up by the unions. We are looking at it but there are difficulties. The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) mentioned brucellosis. He knows very well that I used to be involved in discussions on that subject and indeed supported his point of view in the House of Commons, but he must recognise that if a slaughter policy were fully implemented it would cost £40 million to £50 million. The question whether there should be a small approach here and there is another matter. The problem cannot be solved overnight—I do not use the argument about the strain on the veterinary services. I have to decide the priorities but I recognise that this is an important problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member quoted the White Paper. It is true that we lay great emphasis on conquering animal diseases. We believe that the new emphasis should be not just on cure but on prevention. This is where I hope to do something, and I have indicated to my colleagues what I think should be done. I will bear the matter in mind. The hon. Member was quite right to raise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of water extraction on farms, the Secretary of State has already made a statement. I hope that the farmers will complete their forms. Even if there are difficulties, the advice given is sensible. I say this also in reply to the hon. and learned Member for Cardiganshire (Mr. Bowen). Capital gains and the provisions of the Finance Bill have been mentioned. I recognise that there is a problem here for farmers, and the Financial Secretary has promised to have a look at it. I assure hon. Members that I will consult my hon. and learned Friend the Financial Secretary, as I do on agricultural matters, and I shall put to him very forcibly the point raised by the right hon. and learned Member for Conway (Mr. Peter Thomas). It is not an easy matter from a legal point of view but we shall do our best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welsh education and the provision of an agricultural college have been mentioned several times in this debate. I am a great believer in the development of Welsh agricultural education. During my recent stay in Aberystwyth, where I met representatives of the university, I was impressed by what has been done already. Wales has made a great contribution in
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
this respect. We are not just doing nothing about this. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State has said, confirmed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, we are looking carefully at the problem. It is not being ignored. The Conservatives were in office 13 years and we have been in office only seven months, but my colleagues are looking carefully at the need for an agricultural college. Matters affecting the hill cow subsidy, the question of eligibility, and the problem of marginal land which were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) are also being examined carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the speech which I should have liked to have developed if time had allowed. I congratulate and pay tribute to the Welsh farmer on all his achievements. There can be no denying that ever since the 1947 Act Welsh agriculture has developed and expanded to a degree hitherto unknown. Welsh farmers have adapted themselves to changing economic circumstances. I should also like to pay tribute not only to the Welsh farmer but to members of my own agricultural executive committees in Wales who voluntarily give so much of their time to help agricultural communities in the counties and to my own liaison officers. The development of Welsh agriculture owes a great deal to their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not argue about the Price Review except to say that if the award for milk is examined it will be found that my award was much more generous than any previous award except that made last year. I have quoted the figures time and again. In 1955 there was a plus award of ¾d., in 1956 plus ½d., in 1957 plus ¼d., in 1958 a minus award of 1d., in 1959 no change, in 1960 minus ¼d., in 1961 plus ·8d., in 1962 minus ·4d., and in 1963 plus ½d. An increase was given in the Election year, but we have given an increase not in an Election year but at a time when there are problems of production. We have given a 1d. award which represents a considerable global sum and we have also raised the standard quantity. This has meant to Welsh farmers an extra sum of £1 million. I hope, therefore, that what we have sought to achieve, will not be decried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
Naturally I was interested in references made by hon. Members to specific problems in different parts of the industry. We can increase subsidies here and there but that will not solve the problem of Welsh agriculture. I think that I may have some sympathy here, because the hon. Member for Hereford is a reasonable man. I am certain that the problems of agriculture will not be solved by adopting an across-the-board approach. It is a mistake to regard our agriculture as a single homogeneous unit and to assume that problems can be dealt with by increasing globally across-the-board price supports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to make this clear to the fanning community and to the Opposition. I hope that I made it clear in this year's Review White Paper. Last weekend I attended O.E.C.D. meetings in Paris where we discussed the main problems in the development of the rôle of agriculture and the place of farming communities m the economy. The meetings were attended by 17 full Ministers, and 21 countries participated. We came to a joint viewpoint which endorses the present Government's approach as expressed in the White Paper. This is also how we must look at the problem of Welsh agriculture. There must be a selective approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In actions which we are taking to tackle the basic problems of organisation and structure I want to encourage greater efficiency and improve the scale of production and marketing by the provision of improved credit facilities, by assisting cooperation and group action and by extending and modernising the small farmers' schemes. We are also seeking to develop the hills and uplands which are so vital to Wales, as they also are to my constituency. We are also working on proposals to encourage the voluntary amalgamation of holdings. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Mr. J. Idwal Jones) emphasised this. I have a committee working at full pressure on the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
I shall not deal much further with the question of milk production; otherwise I shall be involved again in the Price Review controversy, but 50 per cent. of all Welsh farms of over 5 acres produce milk for sale and therefore we cannot ignore the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not the time now to develop fully my arguments on milk production. Sufficient to say that it has been rising ever since last November to a point when in April it had increased by 1·62 million gallons or 8½ per cent. in Wales, excluding Monmouthshire. I have not set received separate figures for Wales for May, but for England and Wales together milk production was an all-time record. I know that some people have been Jeremiahs and have said that we have destroyed confidence, but this is not so. There are great problems affecting the small milk producer and inevitably his future is bound up with a joint approach to the organisation of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the main issue and the real problem of Welsh agriculture today which is one of farm size and structure. This is why I extended the small farmers' scheme, which brought within the limits of eligibility a further 40,000 small farm businesses and affected Wales very much. The keeping of farm records is, of course, essential, and the scheme provides for this. I want to see better marketing and greater co-operation. In this respect I pay tribute to the Welsh Agricultural Organisation Society and to what is being done at Howey in Radnorshire by three fanners who have created a small farming machinery syndicate. Welsh farmers are looking ahead. When they examine what we are doing I am certain that they will have every encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee, because of our record in agriculture and because we laid the basis of development in the 1947 Act, are concerned about helping this great industry to develop progressively in the economy. I believe that in the long run, when we present our final proposals to the House of Commons and to the nation, the Welsh fanning community will accept what we have been trying to achieve. I am sorry that I have not been able to answer every point raised in the debate, but those which I have
