	<div class='legislation'>Draft Asian Development Bank (Fifth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and Second Regularised Replenishment of the Technical Assistance Special Fund) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Mark Lennox-Boyd)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Asian Development Bank (Fifth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and Second Regularised Replenishment of the Technical Assistance Special Fund) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other order before us, namely, the Draft International Finance Corporation (1991 General Capital Increase) Order 1993.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lennox-Boyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the two orders is to provide for continued support to two international financial institutions, which we judge to make extremely effective contributions towards the development of their member countries, and which mutually reinforce the priorities that the Government have set for the British aid programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's objectives for the aid programme are set out in the departmental report which was published last month. Our overall aim is to promote sustainable economic and social development and good government, in order to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for poor people. That requires action in several areas: the adoption of sound economic policies; encouragement of the private sector as the source of wealth creation; investment in economic and social infrastructure; projects and programmes which have a positive impact on the lives of the poorest, and improve the status of women; protection of the environment; and higher standards of public administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Asian development fund—the ADF—is the soft lending arm of the Asian Development bank. It provides loans on highly concessional terms to most of the poorest countries in the region, as well as to small Pacific island countries. The Asian Development bank's borrowers are extremely diverse, ranging from large, populous low income countries in south Asia to micro-states in the Pacific. In general terms, the more advanced countries or those considered sufficiently creditworthy borrow from the bank, while the poorest or less creditworthy countries borrow from the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fund's resources are replenished periodically by donor countries. Negotiations on the fifth replenishment were concluded at a meeting in London in December 1991 and raised $4·2 billion for commitment over the period 1992–1995. Subject to parliamentary approval, the United
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Kingdom's contribution will be £86 3 million. That will be paid in four equal instalments in the form of promissory notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major borrowers under the Asian development fund in recent years have been Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Indonesia and Nepal. During the fifth replenishment period, the fund expects to resume lending to Vietnam and Burma, if circumstances permit, and to start programmes in Mongolia and the central Asian republics. India and China borrow only from the bank; they have never had access to concessional resources through the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Asian development fund's work in tackling poverty reduction in the region, and I commend the order to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other order. The International Finance Corporation—the IFC—is part of the World bank group. Its aim is to promote private sector development in member countries. It acts as a lender and equity investor in private sector enterprises, originally exclusively in developing countries but also in recent years to countries in the process of transition to market-based economies in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The IFC also plays an advisory role, which is increasing in importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the second half of the 1980s, the IFC began a five-year programme of expansion, supported by a capital increase approved in 1985 which doubled its capital base from $650 million to $1·3 billion. Approvals grew at an average rate of 20 per cent, a year. It diversified its activities, with a greater focus on capital markets development, privatisation and help for small and medium-scale enterprises, especially in Africa. The IFC also successfully embarked on a policy of borrowing from the international capital markets rather than solely from the World bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This growth coincided with a general shift in the 1980s in thinking about the nature of the development process. In the 1960s and 1970s, many developing countries sought to protect their economies from outside competition, and discouraged foreign direct investment. There was excessive state control of productive enterprises and regulation of prices, which frequently led to inefficient use of resources as well as increasing the opportunities for mismanagement and corruption. As the failure of these policies became increasingly apparent, recognition of the importance of market forces has grown rapidly. The trend has been reinforced over the past few years by the collapse of command economies. Market-driven growth, and a larger role for the private sector, are now—I am glad to say—seen as essential to wealth creation and the reduction of poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IFC is well placed to assist in this process. Its activities fall into three broad categories: investment, resource mobilisation, and advice. To provide the resources to meet those challenges, a capital increase of $1 billion has been approved, bringing the total authorised capital to $2·3 billion. That will allow the IFC to plan for growth of 10 per cent, to 11 per cent, a year during the 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the discussions on the capital increase, consideration was given to strengthening the role of the World bank group as a whole in supporting private sector developments. It was agreed that there should be closer coordination between the IFC and the World bank; and, in particular, that the IFC should assist in the preparation of private sector assessments covering major borrowers. The United Kingdom has been offered an allocation of 52,615
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
shares at a cost of $1,000 a share, making a total commitment of $52·6 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, our subscription will be paid in five equal instalments. We strongly support the work of the IFC and its impressive achievements under the leadership of Sir William Ryrie. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.38 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by welcoming you, Mr. Jones, to the Chair? When we entered the House together on 11 June 1987, I would not have believed that you would reach the dizzy heights of chairing a statutory instrument Committee by 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I will co-operate fully with the Government's proposals. It is rare indeed for a Minister to come to a Committee to propose that money should be given away. We hope that what the Under-Secretary has started this morning will be continued this afternoon by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pronounced Milgai!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I pronounced the word slowly. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the Scottish Labour party conference at the weekend; otherwise my pronunciation would have been better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, my hon. Friend is unable to be here because he has a long-standing engagement in Latin America. He is examining a number of important projects. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) asked the Government to postpone consideration of the orders until they were able to attend. Both my hon. Friends are Members of the Front-Bench overseas development team. Sadly, the Government were not prepared to allow them that small concession, so neither of them is able to attend, but they asked me to say that they wanted to attend and that if the Government had allowed it, they would have been in Comittee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition support the orders and the work of the Asian Development bank. Established in 1966, it is approaching its 30th birthday. It is a measure of the support that has been given by Governments of both parties that as it approaches that anniversary, it has established a reputation that allows the founder members—including the United Kingdom, which is a governing member—to continue to be supportive. We support the Government's proposal to give money to the bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, however, that the Minister will deal with several points. My hon. Friends the Members for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) and for Bradford, West (Mr. Madden) want to speak too, should they catch your eye, Mr. Jones. On 24 February 1993, the Minister gave a written answer to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) in which he stated that arrears were $31 million for the Asian Development bank, $704 million for the Inter-American Development bank and $2,400 million for the World bank. Does he have more recent figures? Would it be appropriate to re-examine the figures; and which countries owe money to the Asian Development bank? Would it be appropriate to write off all or part of the debt because of the huge burden of debt that is affecting every recipient country that borrows money from the bank?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Has the Minister studied the speech by Mr. Olin L. Wethington, Assistant Secretary for International Affairs of the United States Treasury, to the session of the Asian Development bank held on 6 May 1992? Mr. Wethington made several important points. In particular, he made a blunt assertion that the United States, as the equal largest shareholder with Japan, felt that there should not be further replenishment of the Asian Development bank's capital resources until it had radically altered its lending policies. Did the Minister meet Mr. Wethington? Has he met American Treasury officials since the speech was made to discuss the implications of what was said? Radically to alter lending policies for countries that rely heavily on the bank would have serious implications. How would they comply with the five cardinal principles outlined by the minister this morning? How would they ensure sound economic policies, partnership with the private sector and projects promoting the profile of women and those encouraging higher standards if the bank's lending policies were altered? Will the United States also ensure that it proceeds with its replenishment order at the same time as the United Kingdom? It would be pointless for the United Kingdom to give £86 million if the United States—as the equal largest shareholder—and Japan did not lend an equivalent or greater sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Minister's views on the statement made at the same conference by the former Finance Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Sumalin, who asked for rapid approval for the bank's request for a capital increase? The Minister will be aware of the concerns expressed by right hon. and hon. Members from both sides of the House about Indonesia's human rights record. He will also be aware of concern about events in East Timor. Although a country such as Indonesia desperately needs the resources that the Asian Development bank can provide, right hon. and hon. Members are cautious about the United Kingdom lending money or giving aid to countries that subsequently use it for purposes that have not been authorised. Has the Minister had an opportunity to discuss the situation in Indonesia either with the Indonesian ambassador or, during his travels abroad, with the Indonesian Government? Does the hon. Gentleman consider it appropriate that the existing arrangements allow Governments to use aid in that way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke eloquently and quite properly about promoting and encouraging higher standards, but we must be certain that no resources or aid are given to Governments who oppress their people. Does the hon. Gentleman have evidence that any of the money currently lent by the Asian Development bank or fund is being lent on by recipients, with the money being placed in other, perhaps unauthorised, financial institutions, with the result that projects that have been initiated do not benefit immediately from the money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us more about Vietnam? He has no doubt seen the article in today's 
	<i>Financial Times</i> on the progress that it is hoped is being made in Vietnam. What is the Government's attitude? Will the Government, as a governor of the bank, propose that Vietnam receives aid, bearing in mind that country's desperate plight or are they prepared to accept the attitude of the United States, which has for many years blocked funds being given to Vietnam? Frankly, Washington's position cannot be sustained, given the plight of the Vietnamese people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
On the auditing of the bank, has the hon. Gentleman, as the Minister responsible, and the Baroness Chalker, as a governor of the bank, had an opportunity to study the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee's fourth report for the 1991–92 Session entitled, "Banking supervision and BCCI: international and national regulation"? The report tells us a great deal about international banking and the need to ensure that not only private banks but international ones, which are funded by Governments, are properly audited. I am sure that the Minister has seen a copy of the audited reports of the Asian Development bank. I am certain that he would not suggest to the Committee that further funds should be made available without being satisfied that the bank has been properly audited, that all the recommendations and conclusions in the Select Committee report have been considered, and that the bank conforms as far as possible to the Basle concordat on international banking. It is important, as hon. Members will know, given recent circumstances, to make progress in the proper auditing of such huge organisations and institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bank is all about providing funds to Governments to promote projects and alleviate hardship, misery and distress. Its aim, in the words of the bank's 20th annual report, dated 8 June 1986, is to ensure that it fulfils the wishes of its founders to provide the dream of a better life with more dignity for those who live in the poorest nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently had the privilege of going to India to visit the Gujarat and seeing several projects funded by the World bank for which funds were also made available by the Asian Development bank. I was worried by the lack of progress in establishing the Narmada project in the middle of the Gujarat. The Minister will know from his close and warm contacts with the Indian Government that the project is vital to the state of Gujarat. He will also know that the project has the wholehearted support of the Prime Minister of India and of the Chief Minister of the Gujarat, Mr. Chimanbhai Patel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem in making available the funds for completing the project. The Minister knows—the Overseas Development Administration has written to tell me—that difficulties have arisen because of complaints made by many people about the future of the Oustees, those who live on the land near the dam and who will have to move away from it to allow the project to proceed. Does not the Minister agree that, in considering such major capital projects, which will greatly help not only the Gujarat but Maharashtra and other nearby states, the bank must look beyond the mere capital outlay and towards helping the government of the Gujarat and the Indian Government to provide compensation? That is part and parcel of their desire to provide suitable resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not raise the matter because I have a constituency interest, although I have such an interest because some people associated with the state of Gujarat have relatives in my constituency. They are anxious to ensure the project's success. I raise the subject, however, as an illustration. It is the only major project that I have observed about which a third world nation has said, "It is no good just telling us that we will get X amount of money. Capital outlay, as well as the other costs involved in the success of such projects, is necessary."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I hope that the Minister will take on board the points that I have made and that he will accept the Opposition's full co-operation in ensuring that the money is paid as quickly as possible. We welcome the fact that the fund will be replenished, but we have worries. I hope that the Minister will deal with them once my hon. Friends have contributed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.54 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) welcome you, Mr. Jones, to the Chair. I was not surprised that you reached that position so quickly, but I was disappointed that you did so before certain other colleagues, who I thought might also have made a valuable contribution. I have had the difficulty of serving on certain statutory instrument Committees in which the Chairman's face has not been as friendly as I should have liked. It was difficult to have a proper debate on the matter in hand, simply because the Chair sought to narrow the debate—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not in order to criticise the selection of speakers by the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not criticising the selection by Chairmen, Mr. Jones. I was simply making a comment. I appreciate the problem that all Chairmen have—we all have problems with advisers—and we must be careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East will want to speak again once the Minister has replied. So far, he has called an opening gambit on the orders to try to tease out of the Minister what exactly we are doing this morning. The most significant comment made by the Minister—and I am sure that my hon. Friend heard it—was about the drop in the level of funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documentation that we received states that the fourth replenishment was £95.1 million. The Minister said that the fifth will be £86.3 million. That is the first question: why the drop in funds? These are not figures plucked from the air; they come from documentation provided by, one assumes, the House or the Department. We need to know immediately why there has been a dramatic drop in funding, given the horrendous increase in interest rates, and bank charges and other recent currency changes. Where will the impact of that fall in funding occur? Who will suffer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Committee last met, on 9 December 1986, the current governor of Hong Kong was in the Minister's seat and we had a lively debate. My former hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall, Mr. Holland, spoke for the Opposition—he is now doing sterling work in the European University Institute in Florence. He drew several comparisons between how the bank and the fund operate. I shall refer to those because, given that this is the first time that we have debated the bank and the fund since then, it is important that we learn whether the trends that concerned my former hon. Friend have continued or whether the then Minister was able to deal with his concerns, which were also expressed by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My former hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall expressed his concern in the Committee of 9 December 1986, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A bias clearly exists towards bigger countries and bigger projects in the bank's funding."—[
	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 9 December 1986; c.6.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
He went on to say that he had raised the problem in January 1986, and he contrasted the level of bank lending to South Korea, a category C country. In 1984, South Korea was receiving loans of $50 a head. Bangladesh, which, as we all know, is at the bottom of the pile, receives only $17 a head. Why former colleagues made the obvious comment that that is an outstanding contrast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case anyone thinks I am not being fair, let me say that in 1986 the then Minister for Overseas Development, who is now governor of Hong Kong, tried to allay fears by suggesting that the matter was not being considered correctly. The bank, he said, lent to countries such as Korea, Indonesia and Singapore, and Bangladesh received approximately 17 per cent, of loans from the bank and about 53.9 per cent, of the amount available from the fund. My hon. Friend—I am sure that everyone agrees that he is an expert on finance—immediately said that the massive imbalance of lending by the bank in areas such as Asia must be set against the fact that the 53.9 per cent, came from a much smaller fund, unlike the vast sums that are available for lending by the Asian bank. My hon. Friend said that we must look at the whole picture. Perhaps the Minister will tell me what the balance is between lending by the bank and the sums of money received by the various countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attention was drawn to the drop in lending for agriculture, including irrigation and rural development. If my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West catches your eye, Mr. Jones, he will probabley mention Bangladesh because he shares with me and my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr. Khabra) an interest in the floods that regularly occur there. The Minister referred to Nepal; we all know that deforestation there allows mud to be taken down by the rain into the valley in which Bangladesh lies and into the bay of Bengal, where it causes flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know whether the trend which my hon. Friend detected back in 1986—of a fall in funding for irrigation and rural development—is occurring, and whether the governor of Hong Kong tried to reverse it, as he said he would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also want some information on lending. The then Minister for Overseas Development said in 1986 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Lending is interest free, except for a service charge of 1 per cent., with repayment over 40 years."—[
	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 9 December 1986: c. 4.]</p></blockquote>
The Prime Minister and others regularly remind us—I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will take the opportunity this afternoon to do so—that economic problems afflict not only this country, but the whole world. Given the pressure on Governments generally and especially in the developed world, will the Minister confirm that lending is still interest free, except for the service charge of 1 per cent., and that it is still based on 40 years? If there has been a change, will he explain what it means in terms of adding to the debt? As my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East said, we are concerned about the growth in debt in these countries. I look forward to hearing whether the Government intend or accept that some of these debts should be written off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Technical assistance was the other new area identified for aid by the fund and the bank. Before our previous debate, technical assistance was not the main thrust of the fund. A small sum was set aside which paid for technical projects. At that time, the British Government suggested that $72 million should be given for the replenishment of the resources of the technical assistance special fund, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
almost doubled the contributions. We should like to know about the state of the technical assistance special fund and whether there has been a determined drive in that area. It would help if we were told about one or two technical assistance successes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the Opposition intend to boast about making money out of other people's misery, but I point out that one reason given by the former Minister for Overseas Development, Chris Patten—who is now the governor of Hong Kong—for quickly passing the order, was that there would be an immediate return on our contribution. In fact, the imbalance in the return was shocking and alarming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"British business has also done well out of those commitments. From 1982 to 1985, for instance, British firms won orders worth 30 per cent, more than we spent in contributions to the fund."—[
	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 9 December 1986; c. 4.]</p></blockquote>
It is disgraceful that we should be taking more out than we are putting in, given that the fund is supposed to be a development fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Mr. Deva) looks aghast. It is disgraceful that we take more out than we put in. A balance would be acceptable. But if we take more out, we should put more in—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, I shall give way. I should welcome any contribution from Conservative Members. We do not hear much about this matter on the Floor of the House. All too often, when we discuss aid and development work, Conservative Members immediately throw their hands into the air in shock and horror.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman just wants to keep making comments from a sedentary position. He said that what I said was unfair. I think that it is reasonable to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that in 1986, we were taking 30 per cent, more than we contributed to the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know what the balance is today. Are we still taking out 30 per cent, more in orders than we are contributing? If that is the case, it means that we are not contributing enough and that the successes that we had hoped for are not occurring. One would assume that if the fund was spent intelligently in those countries, they would be able, especially through the technical assistance special fund, to develop their own expertise and would not need the expertise from this country for projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to some of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Minister for Leicester, East. It is incredible that the United States of America is trying to dictate to a fund or a bank which countries should receive loans. To determine whether a country receives a loan on the basis of whether it likes the United States or not hits at the very ethos of development aid and assistance. Is the judgment based on how many times that country votes with the United States in the United Nations? Is it based on its performance during the Gulf war? Is it based on its continuing opposition to Saddam Hussein? Is it based on its support for the way in which the American Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
sought to destabilise South American Governments or on its backing for their continuing support for right-wing, fascist Governments in Latin America and South America?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We really need to know why, in 1993, the United States still seeks to dictate to the aid and development fund exactly who should receive loans. Like my hon. Friend, I am absolutely shocked when I hear Indonesia mentioned so casually by the Minister, given its performance in East Timor. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what dialogue has taken place with Indonesia about the way in which the funds are being used, given its treatment of the East Timorese.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend, I certainly look forward to the IFC lending to Vietnam, a country that deserves all the assistance it can get. In talking about the objects of the Asian development fund—irrigation and agriculture—I am reminded of the defoliation that occurred in Vietnam during the war with the United States, of the amount of Agent Orange that was dumped on that country and of the damage that was done to its infrastructure. That country is desperately crying out for assistance and deserves to receive it from any organisation that has money to lend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all that the Minister has said this morning—and I want to hear more from him about the reason for the drop in funds before I support the order—the comment that almost made me jump out of my seat was his mention of giving funds to Burma. How can the Minister possibly consider giving funds to Burma? Hands up anyone in this Room who wants to give funds to Burma—a country that has defied every organisation. The world is opposed to the Burmese Government and to the way in which they are oppressing groups of people in their country. No organisation has been able to use lending, aid, good relations or any peaceful means whatsoever to make the Burmese military junta understand that we want it to respect human rights and allow its people to operate freely in a democratic way. Yet the Minister casually dropped Burma into his speech to the Commitee this morning as if that was not important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Last night, I checked up with the Library and, on almost every other occasion, these apparently insignificant orders have gone through formally, as both sides of the House have agreed that there is no need to discuss them. Given the state of the world economy, and given some of the countries that are on this list as possible donors, it is right that we should take some time this morning to listen to what the Minister has to say about what Britain will do to ensure that our money is spent wisely. Depending on what the Minister says, I shall intervene again, if I am not satisfied with what I hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I listened carefully to the comments of Opposition Members. Although I welcome their support for the order, I found the comments made by the hon. Member for Leicester, East about Indonesia and Vietnam slightly contradictory. There are certain criteria for lending from the Asian Development bank and the Asia development fund, which are defined by issues such as good governance, prices, private sector participation, enhancing the role of women and good administration. The hon. Member for Leicester, East went to some length to complain, quite rightly, about the situation in Indonesia, but appeared to have a blind spot about Vietnam. Is he saying that Vietnam is run by a democratic system of good governance, with a fine human rights record and that we should encourage the continuation of the regime? Or are we to encourage that country to come into the fold of democratic countries that have recently recognised the virtues of the free market? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Since I notice that the hon. Member for Leicester, East is not listening to me, I shall construe that he does not understand what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that we have won 30 per cent. more orders than we have given in contributions, but surely most of the projects that the Asian Development bank and the Asian development fund finance are allocated under competitive tendering. The money is available, a project proposal exists—perhaps to build a dam—and that project is put out to competitive tendering. If British companies are successful against other competitors in winning those contracts, that is jolly good. That is my point. That is an excellent thing to have happended. The projects are awarded under very strict and transparent conditions, as laid down by the World bank and the IFC. If British companies are successful in winning projects, I congratulate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Yesterday, I went to the Vote Office to ask for the supporting documentation for the Committee. All that it had was a miserable page and a half consisting of the order and one paragraph of explanatory notes. In the evening I went to the Library to ask for relevant documentation that might help in consideration of the order. I am grateful to the Library for supplying a copy of 
	<i>Hansard</i> which contains questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) on 24 February and for telling me that an annual report for the Asian Development bank is published. The Library staff told me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will send over the 
	<i>ADB annual report</i> 1991 first thing Tuesday morning. It is at present on loan to the Economics Section. As it is the Library's only copy, we would be grateful if you would then return it to the International Affairs and Defence Section as soon as you have finished with it."</p></blockquote>
I am grateful to the Library for having got me this rare document. It would have been extremely helpful had the Foreign Office and the overseas aid department ensured that members of the Committee were made aware of the document and, more importantly, supplied with it in good time. The document is packed with information which I am sure would have been of great assistance to all members of the Committee, and would have enabled us to ask more penetrating questions than we have been able to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend did not hear the Minister murmuring to his officials that, had my hon. Friend wanted such a report, it could have been given him. Does not my

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
hon. Friend mean, however, that it would have been better for all members of the Committee to have had the report before rather than after the debate and the order had been agreed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As I said to the Minister before our proceedings began, since the Government espouse open government and access to public information, it would have been extremely helpful not only had we been told of the existence of the document but supplied with copies of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's opening speech he rightly pointed out that Her Majesty's Government not only aim to promote sustainable aid but good government and democracy. Page 129 of the annual report refers to the fifth Asian development fund replenishment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the ADF donors' meetings, several major policy issues were discussed, including poverty reduction, improvement of the environment, the role of women in development, population issues, and the Bank's efforts to support policy reforms in developing member countries".</p></blockquote>
There is no reference to good government or promoting human rights or democracy. I have looked briefly at the report and I can see no reference to such issues. I would like an assurance from the Minister that his emphasis, quite rightly, on the promotion of good government, democracy and human rights, will be formally enshrined in the objectives of the replenishment order. I hope that that will be evident in future annual reports of the bank and the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have asked several questions that I shall not dwell on. It is important, however, to refer briefly to the annual report in relation to some of the countries that have already been mentioned, such as Indonesia. Extremely critical remarks have rightly been made about the policies of the Indonesian Government, not least in relation to East Timor. On Indonesia, under the heading "Operational Strategy", the annual report comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In formulating programs, due consideration is given to the country's current development thrust, and Bankwide concerns, such as poverty reduction, social infrastructure, environment and women in development, are reflected. In 1991, removing bottlenecks affecting the country's infrastructure projects was the Government's priority."</p></blockquote>
Not a word about promoting good government or democracy or about observing basic human rights. Such omissions are extremely relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the People's Republics of China and Mongolia, under the heading "Domestic Policies", on page 45, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Economic reforms and opening up to the outside world had been at the centre of PRC's policies in the past decade. They remained so in 1991. The success of the austerity programme encouraged the Government to accelerate the reform agenda, which had slowed down in the late 1980s. Price reforms, a key and sensitive issue, were carried out with great caution on an experimental basis in selected areas. Two-tier pricing of some raw materials, such as cement and steel, was replaced by a unified system."</p></blockquote>
No mention of good government, democracy and the observance of basic human rights. I am sure that we all remember with horror the events of Tiananmen square.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer back to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) on 24 February. Among other questions, he asked the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what level of arrears was owed to the World bank, the Latin American development fund, the African Development bank and the Asian Development bank in each of the past three years. The figures for the Asian Development bank were given as
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
$31 million in 1990, $33 million in 1991, and $31 million at the end of 1992. Will the Minister tell us the current arrears owing to the Asian Development bank? How will this order, which provides a payment of £86 million to that bank, affect the bank's overall arrears?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I think that in terms of parliamentary scrutiny, the information with which we were supplied reduces the Committee to an absurd joke. Having been here for IS years, I must say that this is not the first time that I find myself in such a position. The preparation of information and documentation for the Committee has been appalling. We are dealing with a substantial amount of British taxpayers' money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have made some extremely serious criticisms of the overall policies and strategy of the Asian Development bank. We would have been even more critical if we had been provided with the information from the annual report. I urge the Minister to persuade the bank to ensure at least that the promotion of good government, democracy and human rights is enshrined in the pillars of the bank's investment policies and other policies. I look forward to seeing those terms strongly emphasised in later copies of the annual report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lennox-Boyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I anticipated, I shall probably speak longer now than I did in my opening remarks. I shall certainly do my best to answer most, if not all, of the points, which have principally come from the Opposition. To start at the end, I shall make a few comments about the observations of the hon. Member for Bradford, West and about his main allegation that the material that was provided for the use of the Committee was insufficient. The information that has been provided in support of the two orders follows past practice. There has been no conspiracy. It has been the practice of the House for a number of years to provide an explanatory memorandum. That practice was, no doubt, instituted before I was elected a Member of Parliament in 1979, and it enables hon. Members to gain an understanding of an order before they come to a Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman discovered—and as any other hon. Member could discover after making the briefest of inquiries in the Library—the resolutions relating to the orders were in the Library, as were the annual reports of the institutions. We also placed there the donors report for the fifth ASDF replenishment. Of course, we shall see whether we can do more, but I think it is a bit rich of the hon. Gentleman to expect the Government not just to govern the country but to act as his research assistant. He must do some of the work himself. The House has provided generous funds for hon. Members to have research assistance. It is possible to employ people who can draw the right aspects of problems to the attention of hon. Members. It is also possible to use the services of the Library. We all knew that we would be on the Committee 10 days ago. The librarians would have been delighted to help the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Overseas Development Administration is very generous with information. I answer questions in the House for my right hon. and noble Friend the Baroness Chalker. Those answers are often long because I have adopted the practice of my right hon. and noble Friend, who likes to give full answers and told me so when I asked her for her views on the matter. A simple telephone call to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
my office or the office of my right hon. and noble Friend would have helped the hon. Member for Bradford, West along his path. I cannot accept the strictures he levelled at the Government on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Vaz</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should be aware that Members of Parliament rely on the Government to provide information on specialist matters. When I was informed yesterday that I would be leading for the Opposition today, I telephoned the Minister's private office. It has always been helpful and supportive, and it suggested that I telephone the ODA. The ODA promised that notes of guidance and supporting document would be on the board by 7.15 but no such documents were there at that time. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West is absolutely right. It is no good asking us to consider such complex measures, even though they are statutory instruments, when the documents are as badly prepared as the one in front of me. On page 2 of the draft order there is a mistake in the first line of paragraph 2, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may take payment on behalf of the Government", instead of</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make payment".</p></blockquote>
The correction I note, has been made by hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every member of the Committee should have had a copy of the annual report. I am sure that there are thousands of them around and it is not satisfactory to say that a copy has been placed in the Library. The Minister cannot be held responsible for previous practice, but such orders will be discussed again and my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, West is simply saying that it would be helpful for successor Committees if such reports were made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lennox-Boyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to repeat myself. I have made my case this morning on that aspect. The hon. Gentleman referred to good government and he is right. Good government is at the top of our agenda in all aid matters, and rightly so. It is at the top of the agenda of most international aid organisations. The agenda is set not only by donors but by people in developing countries. Good government benefits them and they must work out how to improve standards of government, including respect for human life. I shall refer to good government again later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening comments, the hon. Member for Leicester, East drew attention, as did the hon. Member for Bradford, West, to arrears and to the answer that was given on 24 February. There is no change in the information that has been provided to the House. Of course, the Government are greatly concerned about arrears, but that is not a real problem in Asia. I contend that to write off official debt owed to multilateral development banks would not be right, because it would affect the credit rating of those countries and thus making lending more expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States' views on the capital increase for the ASDB are not relevant to our debate on the fund today. Discussions on a capital increase for the bank are still in progress. We are awaiting news from the new United States Administration, but we hope that those matters will be tied up by the end of this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lennox-Boyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any delays in the United States' authorisation of its contribution to the fund. I cannot add to what I have already told the Committee:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a few comments about Indonesia, which I mentioned earlier, and which was remarked upon by Opposition Members. Indonesia has made excellent economic progress over the past 25 years because of its stable economic policies and sound management of the economy. It has also made great progress in reducing poverty and we have no evidence of misuse of ASDB money. Of course, the Government are, and were, horrified at events that took place in Dili in November 1991. At the time, we made clear to the Indonesians the very serious view that we took of the events. The Indonesians' response was, in fact, unprecedented and the Indonesian president insisted that action, which included courts martial, be taken against those responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to see further progress, however. We have made representations, as I have said, and we shall continue to do so, but difficult judgments have to be made about human rights and aid. In taking decisions about aid levels for a specific country, we take human rights into account, as do other major donors. It is one of the important criteria that we consider and, where improvements are needed, we raise our concerns with people in the country in question, as we have done in Indonesia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim is to influence the Indonesian Government in whatever ways are most effective and appropriate. We do not believe, however, that suspending economic and technical assistance to Indonesia—a very poor country with an impressive record of economic management and poverty reduction—would be the most effective way of improving the human rights situation in East Timor. A balance must be struck, as is often necessary in aid decisions, but all the factors to which Opposition Members have drawn attention are taken into account in the balanced judgment that my right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Overseas Development ultimately has to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a few comments about Vietnam. We are certainly in favour of early resumption of lending to Vietnam and we hope that the ASDB will soon resume lending there. Of course, the United Kingdom makes its own contribution to Vietnam—of some £3 million to the European Community-led international reintegration programme for returning economic migrants. We also support the special joint funding scheme with a contribution of £2 million for non-governmental organisation community development and job creation projects in provinces to which a large number of Hong Kong boat people are returning. We give money for macro-economic training support. We envisage a modest expansion in the programme and have pledged to contribute to future International Monetary Fund support group operations. We are also assisting the Vietnamese with other matters. So the Government's direct interest is well established in that area. I shall comment on the Narmada valley project in India, which the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) mentioned. It is a matter of some controversy, as the hon. Gentleman knows. If I may say so, with his contacts in the Government of India, one might expect the hon. Gentleman to take a slightly different view from some of his hon. Friends. He is rather
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
enthusiastic about the project, subject to the qualifications that he mentioned this morning. I recall his asking a question on the Floor of the House, when his enthusiasm was certainly greater than that of some of his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a difficult matter, because of the environmental and displacement problems. An independent review team issue a report in June and, after a period of intensive consultation, the World bank's board considered the management's proposals on the way ahead on 23 October 1992. No vote was taken but six directors, who represented a little under 44 per cent. of the voting power, expressed a preference for immediate suspension of disbursements. That is a matter of record. Our executive director made it clear that if real progress on resettlement, rehabilitation and environmental issues had not been made by April, as set out in the detailed work programme endorsed by the Indian authorities, disbursements must be suspended forthwith. I think that the hon. Member for Leicester, East is aware of that arrangement, which has not changed. It remains as I described it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment on remarks made by the hon. Member for Dundee, West who, quite rightly, drew attention to and asked about the apparent drop in the amount of funding from the Government. The reason for the drop in sterling terms is the movement in the exchange rates between the two replenishment periods—a common phenomenom in aid matters. Sometimes there is a great increase because of currency movements; sometimes there is an apparent drop. The drop was apparent in sterling terms. The British contribution to the ASDF 5 for the period 1987 to 1991 was £95 million—a 3·8 per cent, share of all contributions. In the ASDF 6, which we are discussing, the contribution of £86 million is still a 3·8 per cent. contribution. Translating those figures into dollars, the United Kingdom commitment increased from $137 million for the first period to $165 million. There has thus been no reduction in our contributions. I can confirm to the hon. Member for Dundee, West that the development fund lending terms have not changed. The terms are for a 40-year repayment at 1 per cent., and that is highly concessional.

Technical assistance was also mentioned by the hon. Member for Dundee, West. That remains a high priority—$140 million was set aside in the fifth replenishment for technical assistance, which the United Kingdom regards as important, especially for effective project design. I have personal feelings about the United Kingdom procurement return, which was touched on helpfully by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth. It is a matter not for criticism but for congratulation when the United Kingdom does well in procurement. I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Dundee, West has strong views that the British aid programme should be targeted towards the poorest people in the world. In that, I am sure that he is supported by many of his hon. Friends. The success of the British aid programme is in no sense undermined if the hon. Gentleman's criteria for helping the poorest in the world if, at the same time, British industry benefits. British industry should be congratulated. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth said, contracts are awarded by international competitive tendering. Contracts won by British firms reflect the excellence of their bids and their good management. That is not something to be ashamed of or to find disgraceful.

Our consultants are advising developing countries about tackling their development problems. To do that, those countries often need high-technology goods and the services of our companies. I have no hesitation in saying that far from being ashamed of what was disclosed to the House, I am proud that British companies are doing so well.

I know that we are having a public debate this morning, but it is not closely monitored by the people of this nation. If the hon. Member for Dundee, West and I were to argue the matter on a television programme at peak-hour viewing one evening, I have not doubt whose argument would receive the cheers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lending to Burma will not resume until conditions are appropriate. Nothing is planned by the ASDF for the foreseeable future. Its strictures are borne in mind by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money in the aid programme and in the ASDF is spent wisely. Donors have stressed, as they did in the previous report, that allocation should increasingly be based on country performance. Demand for concessional resources so far outstrips supply that donors have stressed that greater weight should be given to country performance to ensure that resources go to countries which need them most and which can use them most effectively. Donors also welcome the intention of management to strengthen the country programming process and to devote more attention to improved project quality. The debate has been a proper examination of the matter, with opportunity for hon. Members to ask questions and raise concerns. I invite the Committee to approve the two orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too am glad that we are having this debate. I am rather sad that the press is not here to witness it. We never hear about some of the things that the Minister said and about which his hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth boasted. That is one of the reasons why I raised them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When would we have been told about the great success that we have scored in getting 30 per cent, more money back than we have put in? When was the Minister going to trumpet that across the Benches in the House of Commons?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth and I have similar backgrounds in that we are both members of ethnic communities. I am certain that he would ensure that people understand the need for aid and development. However, I am uncertain about the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Sir P. Beresford). He is one of the members of the Committee who probably understood what the Minister meant when he talked about the dramatic reduction in funding from £95·1 million to £83·6 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Minister trying to confuse a simple soul like me by talking about high finance and the difference in exchange rates during the period. Frankly, money is money. The Minister has suddenly sprung this matter on the Committee and we are expected to accept his explanation. That might have sat better on his shoulders if, as the hon. Member for Bradford, West suggested, we had received the information before our meeting. Without questioning the Minister's statement, it would have given us the opportunity to consider the matter and to decide whether the Minister was as accurate as he would have us believe. We could have been assured about what he was saying.

I return to where I started. When will the Minister announce the Government's success and determination in supporting aid and development, and the Asian development fund? Was there to be a special statement on the Floor of the House? I do not think so. If we were not discussing the statutory instrument this morning, we would never have heard about it. We would certainly not have seen Conservative Members jumping up and down, as they were this morning, if this debate had not taken place. That worries Opposition Members because we are discussing serious matters. When discussing aid and funding to developing countries in the Third world, Conservative Members suggest that there is nothing in it for Britain, but there clearly is, as we have heard this morning. The Minister said that he wants to trumpet the matter widely, but he did not answer the question on whether we are still getting back 30 per cent. more—or whether that has increased. We need to know and if the Minister is so concerned about the matter, he should ensure that we receive regular information. Had we not had our debate this morning, we would have been none the wiser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tried to respond helpfully and I thank him for his comments on Vietnam. The hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth also referred to Vietnam and to whether it should be allowed to receive loans or whether it should be asked to do more. We all welcome the moves in Vietnam towards a more pluralistic and open democracy. The Vietnamese are struggling hard to reform their Government. I referred this morning to the devastation in that country following the Frendh colonial wars and the American involvement, and I was pleased with the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all have our own views and I do not draw any conclusions on the rights and wrongs, but Vietnam desperately needs help. If there has ever been a case for arguing for Britain's interests, Vietnam is one. It has untapped resources, such as oil, which is waiting to be extracted. Our railway industry is in decline, but Vietnam is crying out for a railway infrastructure. We could be supplying that infrastructure. Vietnam is opening its doors to foreign investment and if we get in quickly, we shall all be able to jump up and down and say that money has been well spent. The Minister also referred to Indonesia. I do not know where he has been living. He referred to action against those responsible, but I have yet to see a single person who was responsible for the massacre in November 1991 being brought to trial anywhere in Indonesia. I have yet to see an investigation carried out into who was responsible. I and other interested parties have evidence only that people who participated in the demonstration are in gaol or are having to hide because they fear arrest. The Minister cannot get away with saying that the president of Vietnam said that there should be action against those responsible. Not one military person has been investigated or brought to book following the massacre. It is not sufficient for the Minister to quote the presidents words. I turn to Burma. The Minister said that something would be done when conditions are appropriate. How will we know
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
when they are appropriate? Will there be an announcement in the House, or will the news be quietly slipped through that Burma has been given some appropriation? That is crucial because it is an area in which we can have some impact, to the benefit of the Burmese people. We are one of the major players: we can send a message to the military junta in Burma that the House of Commons is watching every move that it makes and that we are determined that no appropriations will be given to Burma until the human rights situation in that country has improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be reassuring to add to the principles of the bank and the fund the key criterion for granting loans or other assistance of the promotion of good government, democracy and the observance of human rights? The Minister has stated that that is one of the Government's objectives. Does my hon. Friend agree that every effort should be made to encourage the bank and the fund to incorporate that principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Minister need not feel alone in this. He did not reply to the point that was raised by my hon. Friend, who referred to his ability to obtain a copy of the fund's report. When the European Community considers technical assistance, financial protocols and involvement with other countries—as it did recently in the cases of Israel, Morocco and Syria—one of the criteria used by the European Commissioners and the European Parliament in determining whether to give assistance is human rights observance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
