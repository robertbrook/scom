	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for School Standards (Ms Estelle Morris)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance Special grant report (No. 66) on Threshold and Leadership Group Payments (House of Commons Paper No. 568).</p></blockquote>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about the next phase to transform teaching in this country by offering career and pay structures that reward good classroom teaching in a way that the teaching pay structure has never been able to do before. Members of the Committee will be aware that grant 66 arises from the Government's Green Paper, "Teachers: meeting the challenge of change", which sets out our major objectives for reforms in the teaching profession. Grant 66 concentrates on how we make available to schools the payment of £2,001, which is the increase in salary that will be paid to those teachers who are crossing the threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new grant will channel funds to schools via local education authorities in direct proportion to need. It provides that schools will receive the full amounts to which they are entitled without funding being retained by the local authority, except for eligible teachers employed directly by local authorities, who will be entitled to grant support under the same conditions as teachers in schools. There will be no quotas on the payment made under grant 66. The Government will fund every eligible claim at the rates set out in the grant report under discussion today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant 66 is in two parts. There will be a threshold grant that covers the full costs of the increased salaries of teachers entitled to be paid on the new upper pay scale as a result of passing the threshold or through fulfilling other specific conditions. There will also be a leadership group grant, which will support the costs to schools of restructuring their leadership structures and appointing classroom teachers or advanced skills teachers to permanent positions at the new grade of assistant head teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain how grant 66 will be paid. For the first time, teachers have the prospect of a significant pay progression to recognise the core job of classroom teaching, as long as they meet national quality standards set out by the Secretary of State. Grant 66 fulfils our undertaking to fund fully the increase in
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
teachers' salaries as a result of their passing the threshold. Each teacher moving to the new upper pay range with effect from 1 September 2000 will receive a salary increase of £2,001. The grant will fund that amount in full and the related costs of national insurance and pension contributions at a standard rate of 17.8 per cent. There is no quota on the numbers to be funded in that way; it will depend entirely on the number of teachers who pass the threshold assessment process. Members of the Committee may know that applications are being assessed now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The threshold element of the grant will fund at the same rate those teachers who have become entitled to be paid on the upper pay scale by virtue of stepping down to classroom teacher status from posts as heads or deputies with effect from 1 September 2000 or who were employed formerly as advanced skills teachers. Local authorities will receive funding from the Department on a monthly basis throughout the grant period. Those payments will be calculated to ensure that authorities have sufficient funds to pay immediately the additional costs of teachers receiving higher pay after passing the threshold. As soon as their success is confirmed, teachers will not have to wait to receive the extra pay to which they are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will receive an initial payment on 15 August 2000. It will be calculated on the basis of threshold applicant numbers; this year there were 197,000 in England. The amount of monthly payments will subsequently be adjusted between November and January 2001 once success rates from the threshold assessment process are known, and once actual teacher numbers have been reported by authorities to the Department in February and April 2001. A similar process will be implemented for the threshold next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will provide the Department with three dates during the grant period with a consolidated full-time equivalent number of teachers who are entitled to be paid on the upper pay scale. The monthly payments will be adjusted to take account of those data. At the end of the grant period, the Department will make any final adjustments necessary to align the payments made to authorities and the costs that they have incurred. Payments to the schools for the threshold payment will be made monthly in the usual way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second element of grant 66, the leadership group grant, is intended to support fully the costs to school budgets of the creation of a broader leadership group. For every full-time equivalent classroom teacher or advanced skills teacher appointed by 31 December 2000 on a permanent basis to a new assistant head teacher post, authorities will receive £2,000, plus 17.8 per cent. for pensions and national insurance contributions, during academic year 2000–01. That must be passed on in full to the schools employing those teachers. The Department will make a single calculation of cost based on the full-time equivalent numbers of such teachers received from local authorities by 31 January 2001.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been studying the statutory instruments, and there are some complicated formulae involving epsilons and all sorts of Greek letters. Perhaps the Minister will give us a full explanation of how the formulae are calculated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best. I suspect that I shall not be able to give a full explanation, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman if he is not happy. The reports, which include a key, are clearly set out in detail. I am sure that, having studied them fully before attending the Committee, he will be able to understand the formulae.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formulae detail different sums of money payable throughout the year. The figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are the number of months. Given that the payments start during the financial year, we are ensuring that schools are fully funded for every extra penny that they have to pay to teachers who rightly deserve the extra pay. If the hon. Gentleman has any doubt above and beyond that about the strengths of the formulae, or a suspicion that they will not fulfil their function, I would be happy to consider that. The formulae are detailed calculations of how we ensure that, for every teacher who passes the threshold, the sum of £2,001 plus 17.8 per cent. goes to the local authority, and is then paid monthly to schools. They also cover how we ensure that, for every teacher who joins the leadership pay spine, the sum of £2,000 goes to the local authority and then forward to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the grant reports will find the favour of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara, to debate the interesting and—if I may adopt a neutral word at this stage—stimulating grants and the mathematical formulae on which they are based. I am sure that every member of the Committee will do his best to do justice to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be slightly more controversial, we noted the Minister's promise to the teaching profession. Today is the day that the Government unveiled their annual report. I doubt that the Minister will find many teachers dancing with glee at what the Government have done for the teaching profession in their first three years. The Minister has given us a promise, and it is up to us to test what the Government are now promising to do after three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reports should be dealt with separately. They relate to grants being made for four purposes. Special grant report No. 66 contains two of those purposes, both of which relate to the remuneration of teachers, including, as the Minister said, local authority expenditure connected with the introduction of performance-related pay. I turn to that aspect first, as it is an important part of the Government's policy. Although the Opposition subscribe to the general principle of rewarding good teachers, how effective the Government's scheme for performance-related pay will be in practice is another matter and remains to be seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have studied the document and asked the Minister about the formulae. Perhaps my hon. Friend could explain exactly what the formula on page 7—
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='img'></div> <!-- img -->
<br><br><!-- lb -->
—means. Does he believe that most teachers will readily be able to work out exactly what they are entitled to be paid under that formula?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are told in a famous advertisement that we always remember a good teacher. I remember my maths teacher well. He was one of the best teachers who taught me, although maths was not my best subject, by any means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will accept that from the right hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That teacher made a realistic estimate of my abilities. I took the old GCE O-levels, and CSEs were a separate examination. He entered me for both the GCE and the CSE, as a lower limit for my ability. It was a good prediction, because I was awarded a grade 5 mathematics pass at O-level, when grades 1 to 6 represented a pass, and a grade 1 CSE, which showed that he had a realistic estimate of my abilities. However, it is well beyond my abilities to make sense of the mathematical formulae.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister said about the intention behind the formulae—to reimburse local authorities for the cost of performance-related pay over a period as the numbers applying for performance-related pay and passing the threshold become known. However, whether the formula will achieve that in practice is a different matter. I made the point about whether the Government will achieve their objectives in practice. We want to know whether the sums add up and whether the Government can demonstrate that to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A moment ago, the Minister cited 197,000 as the number of teachers who applied for performance-related pay. I believe that I am right in saying that the number of teachers who were eligible to apply was 265,000. Let us take the figure of 197,000 as a working assumption and feed it into the initial formula in paragraph 4 on page 5. The Minister might like to make a working assumption—I am sure that the Department for Education and Employment has one—about how many of those applicants will pass the threshold, and she might like to feed those two variables into the formulae. She may be able to tell us eventually, when she winds up, the figure that comes out at the other end, after four pages of mathematical formula, at the bottom of paragraph 11. The Minister should be able to demonstrate to the Committee that those figures work, so I would ask that the two variables be fed into the formula so that we can find out how much comes out the other end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many teachers have recently been engaged in applying to cross the threshold to receive a £2,000 pay rise. The deadline for teachers to complete and pass their applications on to their head teacher for that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
performance-related pay was 5 June, but has been extended to 14 July. Many teachers seem to have made their application at a fairly late stage. As events have turned out, many teachers will have made their case and provided the required factual evidence of how their teaching has, in the past, affected their pupils' achievements, at the very time when their existing pupils who are examination candidates are at a critical point in their academic careers and in need of support. That is not a desirable coincidence. It is not the best time to ask teachers to provide the evidence needed for those performance-related pay applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The SI seems excessively complicated. Has my hon. Friend thought how much teacher time will be spent working out whether they have worked out a formula correctly, how much local education authority time will be spent checking that teachers have worked it out correctly, and how much time the Department for Education and Employment will spend in checking that local authorities have worked it out correctly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valuable point about the amount of time that will be spent by all involved in the process. At the moment, we are discussing teachers' applications for performance-related pay. On the Department for Education and Employment website, teachers are told that the standards by which their applications will be assessed are rooted in good teaching practice and cover five areas: professional knowledge and understanding, teaching and assessment, pupil progress, wider professional effectiveness and professional characteristics. In a subsequent paragraph, teachers are told:
	<br><blockquote><p>You will need to provide concise factual evidence of how your teaching has affected your pupils' achievements. Looking at two or three representative groups of pupils, you need to describe pupils' prior attainment, expected progress and progress achieved. The evidence you provide will vary according to the pupils. Where relevant, you should use Key Stage test results, end of the year test results or examination data. You should look at examples of pupil progress over the last two or three years.</p></blockquote>
Teachers have to ferret around and provide that information about their past pupils at the time of year when existing pupils are taking examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers are being required to take several steps and members of the Committee can imagine that they will, naturally, want to do justice to themselves and present themselves in the best light. Clearly, they will spend a reasonable amount of time filling in their applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The head teachers will also have to spend a lot of time on the applications, under the system of performance-related pay, because responsibility for those applications rests with them in the first instance. Head teachers will have to make careful professional judgments. As was said in reply to a written parliamentary question on 21 February:
	<br><blockquote><p>In considering applications to cross the performance threshold, headteachers will need to make a professional judgment on whether the progress made by a teacher's pupils is as good as would be expected from local and national context of the school. In reaching a judgment, we would expect headteachers to think
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
about the evidence presented by the teacher against the pupil progress standard, particularly whether the evidence is representative of the range of the teacher's work and whether it demonstrates care and attention to all pupils.—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 21 February 2000; Vol. 344, c. 696W.]</p></blockquote>
As with teachers, head teachers will, of course, want to behave responsibly and to do the best by each of the teachers who make applications. They will want to be fair. They will therefore have fairly and thoroughly to consider teachers against each of the criteria. That will amount to another substantial call on head teachers' time and energy, when they have already received many such substantial calls under the Government, which take them away from the vital task of providing leadership in their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the average school, particularly secondary schools—which the Government have told us today that they are keen to improve—much of head teachers' time will be taken up in looking at each teacher's application for performance-related pay. I ask the Minister to consider that and to give us an estimate of the average time that a head teacher would spend on assessing a teacher. I am not optimistic about receiving an exact response—or indeed any response—from her on that. I asked the same question on a different matter last week in respect of another statutory instrument that also put onerous responsibilities on heads of drawing up documents and setting strategic targets and performance frameworks and so on, but I did not receive a response. I should be grateful if the Minister would give us an idea of how much time she expects a head teacher to spend on the assessments</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend's remarks and I absolutely agree with him. Will it not at the end of the day be a matter of subjective judgments by the head teacher—quite naturally—about her or his staff, wrapped up in a complex mathematical formula that will cover the head teacher's tracks in the light of the extremely unpleasant reactions that he or she may receive from some of their disappointed teachers? Given that almost every teacher who seems to be eligible for the money has applied—the numbers are very high—would it not make more sense to give the money directly to the head teacher to use sensibly, as he or she sees fit, to reward good teachers in the classroom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend has arrived at the conclusion to which common sense must drive everyone: that this is a complex system and that there must be a simpler way of doing things. One such way would be to put more faith in the judgment of head teachers and allow them to devise a system of assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us how much has been spent on training heads to assess teachers for the purpose of performance-related pay? On a more sensitive matter, will she say a little about what will be the role of other members of the teaching staff in assessing their colleagues for performance-related pay? I shall not refer to a particular legal case. Will other members of the teaching staff be required to assist in that process? If not, why has a requirement for teachers to assist head teachers in the carrying out of assessments and,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
in some cases, to assist the assessors, too, been inserted into the document on school teachers' pay and conditions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessors will be brought in to assess the work of the head teachers in assessing the teachers. They will be considering the decisions of head teachers on assessments during the autumn term 2000 and the spring term of 2001. Will the Minister give us details of the most recent information on how many assessors will be employed and say how much that will cost? Such questions have been asked before, although the answers have not always been crystal clear, but at this stage the Government must have some idea of the number of assessors and the cost. Can the Minister give the Committee an estimate of the overall cost of administration of the performance-related pay scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the performance-related pay cost for each teacher crossing the threshold, can the Minister confirm that the grant payment will cover not only the £2,000 payment to the teacher but the employment on-costs in terms of national insurance and so on for teachers taking a slightly higher figure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special grant report No. 66 also deals with local authority expenditure on the salaries of assistant head teachers—a new category that is being introduced into the leadership group proposals that take effect in the autumn term this year, as the Minister said. Can the Minister give her best estimate of the number of posts that are to be created and the overall cost? Can she also confirm the figure of £2,356 as the cost of appointing an assistant head, that being £2,000 plus on-costs of £356? Can the right hon. Lady tell the Committee whether the grant from the Department will cover the full cost of an assistant head? I believe she suggested that it would, but we should like additional confirmation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document contains some complex formulae. We think that it is entirely reasonable to ask these questions to ascertain how easy it will be to understand its level of complexity. It is incumbent on the Minister to give us that information, with some idea of the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document refers to the grant calculation for supply teachers for whom, as my hon. Friend is aware, there is a different formula. Are not supply teachers who teach in more than one school likely to be assessed on different criteria? If that is so, their calculation will be horrifically difficult to understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, to which the Minister may want to respond. We are being asked to authorise a special grant to cover costs incurred by local authorities, so it is reasonable to ask the cost. If we are to be diligent in our duty of scrutiny as parliamentarians, it is incumbent on us to add up the figures and see what the cost will come to, as well as to ask wider questions about the scheme itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased, Mr. O'Hara, that you are here to oversee our numeracy hour. We are pleased to see the report on
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
these grants because it answers queries that were raised by all of us on the Opposition Benches. We wanted full compensation for LEAs and schools in respect of the performance-related pay scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that I and my colleagues do not support the threshold-based scheme. We have major concerns, one of which is the bureaucracy element to which the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) referred. We prefer a fundamentally different scheme based on the skills and responsibilities of teachers rather than the performance threshold that has been set in the report. We are also concerned that payments of the grant are not to be made until a teacher has reached the top of the experience scale, which we believe means after seven years. We consider that a scheme that would kick in earlier would be of greater benefit to issues such as the retention of teachers. A scheme that is able to reward teachers after perhaps two, three or four years would help to deal with the crisis of teachers leaving the profession early if they think that they will not be able to advance sufficiently quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the present grant, the key is to get certainty for all concerned—the teachers, the LEAs and the schools. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the teachers do not need to worry about the formulae in the report because their payment will be fixed at £2,001, and that they will receive that in their salary payments so they do not need to worry about the formulae by which the LEAs are reimbursed, as that is a separate issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask three questions about the reimbursements and hope that the Minister is able to respond. First, what consultation has she had with schools about the mechanism for payment, and what was their response? Despite the Government's proclamations of generosity, schools continue to operate on tight budgets. They will find it difficult if they do not receive payments at the appropriate time, and in good time to pay salaries. The second question is what consultations the Minister has had with LEAs in respect of their payments. Again, LEAs will find it extremely difficult if payments are not timely. In relation to the formulae, I hope that the Minister will cut through them and explain why she is confident. In particular, she should let us know what organisations such as the Local Government Association have said in respect of LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it may be difficult at present to get a coherent response from all the local education groups within the LGA. The Conservative group, at least, is in turmoil at the moment, as people who do not believe in pre-schools are removed from senior positions and replaced by those who do believe in preschool policy. It would be interesting to know what the LGA and individual LEAs have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final question is, can the Minister give further assurances about future years funding? She has given assurances previously at the Dispatch Box, but it is important to repeat them or secure further assurances. We want an assurance that additional payments will not be removed from mainstream school and LEA budgets in future, were this Government or another
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Government to fail to back up the schemes that they instituted, or fail to resource schools properly in a system that is not funded from mainstream budgets, and was never designed to be funded from those budgets. It is important to note that those who queried the scheme have had a reasonable amount of success, given that the Government have proposed another scheme under which, if the calculations are correct, 100 per cent. compensation is offered to LEAs and schools in respect of the PRP scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are always nostalgic occasions for me, as I have the chance to wander down memory lane. It gives me great pleasure to see the Minister firmly in charge. That is her reward for spending many hours being subjected to what I had to say when our roles were reversed. I am sure that she will enjoy the occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can enjoy the occasion as well, as it gives me a chance to consider the issues and see whether I can tease out answers to questions that have not been asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan). My approach tends to be to ask myself, the Minister and the Committee to consider the likely impact of the proposals on recruitment, retention, motivation, reward and differentials. The proposals are likely to have an impact on all those factors, although not all of them will necessarily be affected positively. I hope that the Minister can reassure the Committee that the proposals under consideration will not have adverse effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's estimate of the likely impact on recruitment to the teaching profession of these proposals? It may be relatively negligible, because, as I understand it, we are not discussing entry skills. I shall not speculate on whether the lure of the salary progression that will be introduced is likely to have a positive effect on recruitment. The Minister may want to advise the Committee on that, given that the recruitment of quality people to teaching is as important now as it ever was, although the question of retention is more crucial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has raised an extremely interesting point about recruitment. Has he seen the figures that appeared in a written answer at the beginning of June, which suggested that recruitment to initial teacher training has decreased in many subjects, especially in the shortage subjects of science, mathematics and technology? Those figures are down on last year, and well down on the figures achieved during his last year in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is kind of my hon. Friend to make that observation, which modesty prohibits me from making; I am grateful to him. In fairness to the Minister, the problem has existed for some time, and it varies occasionally. It is incumbent on the Minister to satisfy us that the proposal will have no adverse effect
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
on recruitment or retention, given what my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere brought to our attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will appreciate, for every positive effect of such a scheme there is at least the potential for a negative effect. Those given the additional rewards may rejoice and want to continue working in the profession, but there is a danger that those who do not achieve them will be de-motivated and want to leave it altogether. I shall return to that important point in a different context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was at great pains to say that, in effect, the scheme was a blank cheque written by the Department and the taxpayer. She told us that every award would be funded, which is obviously good news in terms of the scheme itself, but it leaves the interesting question of whether there is any limit on the number of teachers who can cross the threshold. Is the threshold relative or absolute? Could we end up with a situation in which every teacher crosses the threshold and is rewarded by the unlimited funding that the Minister has generously guaranteed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That returns us to retention and motivation. If everyone is eligible for the money, it may be a thinly disguised means of increasing pay scales generally, but if only some are eligible, there could be disincentive effects as well as incentive effects, and a possible negative effect on retention. It is important that we hear the Minister's assessment of whether there is any limit on the number of people who can cross the threshold. That issue leads to many interesting questions, although I need not detain the Committee with them, save to offer a couple of brief thoughts on the nature, quality and reliability of the assessment process. To what extent is it likely to lead to over-rewards? Is it likely to be tough? That in turn affects my previous questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask a series of connected questions that have not yet been asked, although I suspect that the Minister can answer readily and quickly when she sums up. We have not been told what the attitudes of the teaching unions are and what their response and that of their members is likely to be. Members of the Committee know that there are several teaching unions, and that they exist in a competitive world; from time to time, some take a different view from others. Before the Committee plunges headlong into agreeing to the proposals, it should be made fully aware of the Minister's assessment of the attitude of all the teaching unions to the proposals, of whether there is any likelihood of conflicts between the unions and the Department or among the unions themselves, and of whether the members of the unions are satisfied with the direction in which the scheme is going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have resisted the temptation to intervene, but I have not. Will the right hon. Gentleman regale the Committee with details of how much notice he took of teaching unions' views when he was legislating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; he can intervene as often as he likes. I recall once saying to Doug McAvoy that I should probably provide a

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
desk for him in my office, as he was in and out of it so often. I said that in a spirit of comradeship and brotherliness. Doug and I got to know each other rather well, but I do not want to single him out and cause offence to any other teaching unions. I saw the general secretary of one the other day in Victoria street and bade him good day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall get back to the point, as I do not want to digress as unduly as the hon. Gentleman tempts me to. First, however, I shall share a little secret with the Committee: I had the great honour of being a member of a Government and serving a Department for five years or so, and I believe that we were, in the end, unduly inhibited by paying great attention to the views of the teaching unions and therefore being unable to do much of what we wanted. That is my assessment with a decent period of hindsight. To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, we bent over backwards and might have gone too far, if that is possible, in paying attention to the unions. I do not want to digress further. I am keeping a close eye on your body language, Mr. O'Hara, and it is not favourable, so I shall press on rapidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) mentioned supply teachers, and it is possible that a serious problem exists. The Minister must go some way toward satisfying the Committee that the proposed mechanisms for dealing with supply teachers are fully adequate for the purpose. You and I know, Mr. O'Hara, that supply teachers are an essential part of the education system and process. However, they live a different existence from other teachers, because they are, by definition, mobile, flexible and move quickly between one school and another, so fitting supply teachers into the assessment process credibly and efficiently is likely to be extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need to be far more satisfied than I now am about the formula and the proposed approach. I suspect that the formula is not comprehensible, although I am sure that the Minister understands it intimately. On page 9, the grant calculations for supply teachers are set out in enormous detail. We do not need to bother too much about that. The question we need to ask is whether it is credible and possible to take a viable approach to supply teachers in the context of the scheme's general thrust and its detail. I suspect that the more complex the scheme, the less likely it is to deal with the complexities of supply teaching. We need a lot more assurance on that front than we have had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my right hon. Friend when he is making such a good analysis of the supply teacher formulas and the problems for supply teachers. What will happen if a supply teacher, or any other teacher, believes that a head has got the formula and the calculation wrong and appeals against the decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a clue—that is the straight answer. I will allow the question to bounce off me in the direction of the Minister, because it is appropriate and leads me neatly to my next point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right, hon. Friend for giving way again. I shall be brief and not ask him to regale the Committee with stories, as Government Members have asked him to do. Would he be assured if the Minister could tell him the key variable for supply teachers for the present year? The key variable under paragraph 13 is the FTE count of supply teachers who are entitled to be paid on the upper pay scale as reported by the authority by 30 April 2001. Would my right hon. Friend be assured if the Minister could give us that figure for this year? Her Department must have the figure, because we have passed 30 April. Could that figure be fed into paragraph 13 and the following calculations in paragraph 14, so that we could be told the figure that came out at the bottom of paragraph 15?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to the Minister, it would be proper to allow a little time for the information to reach her, so that she can give it to the Committee, but the information is obviously relevant. To give any credibility to the approach suggested for supply teachers generally, we need to be reassured that the formula mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is workable and meaningful. We want reassurance that the figures exist and are reliable and relevant to the world of supply teaching, which is much more flexible and variable than that of mainstream teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, I shall now move on to administration. The subject has been touched on, but it is incumbent on us to make an estimate, with the help of the Minister, of the administrative and bureaucratic burden of the process on the education system as a whole. My hon. Friend outlined clearly the burden on individual teachers, and an obvious burden will be placed on head teachers; we barely touched on the assessment process, but it has some significant ramifications. We are discussing the inevitability of additional costs at classroom level, school level, local education authority level and, therefore, national level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the Department for Education and Employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; how could I forget it? It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister a direct question: what estimate has the Department made of the cost of implementing the measure and maintaining it in good order, so that all those who may be eligible are properly assessed and promptly paid? The Department must have made an estimate. To put it in rather crude terms, what will be the overheads of the system? Will they be fully reimbursed at each of the levels that I mentioned? Otherwise, I fear a hidden bureaucratic burden—a form of stealth bureaucracy—will yet again be loaded on to hapless teachers, heads, schools and local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to some of the descriptions of the process. For example, page 13 of the report says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Schools, and local authorities for centrally employed teachers, will complete threshold salary support application forms listing those FTE teachers for whom funding is claimed as a result of their entitlement to be paid on upper pay scale. Authorities will then submit consolidated FTE numbers to the DfEE on the dates specified in Part II of Annex A.</p></blockquote>
It then makes a reference to supply teachers. If the system is to work properly and fairly and do justice to each teacher, applying the threshold as it is intended, surely it will be complicated and therefore expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leadership element of the system has caught my eye. The leadership group will comprise heads, deputies and the new category of assistant head teachers who have substantial strategic responsibility within the school. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>The purpose of the grant is to support the costs of classroom teachers and advanced skills teachers newly appointed as assistant head teachers on a permanent basis.</p></blockquote>
The question arises whether there is any desire for a mechanism to limit the number of assistant head teachers. If there were no limit, it strikes me that another scam could be in the offing, akin to what many people believe to have been a fiddle over many years in respect of responsibility, pay and the like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the system throws up a large number of assistant head teachers, or allows almost everyone to achieve something of that sort and cross the threshold, one can imagine an odd world in which everyone receives a prize. It is one of those races in which no one can be a loser and nearly everyone will win. That is relevant not only because of the possible effects on recruitment, retention, motivation and the like, but because of the huge budgetary implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, I accept what the Minister told us at the outset when she said that every award would be paid in full by the Department—that is, the taxpayer—but we are entitled to ask whether there are no limits on the process. Does the Department have any view about how many people may cross the threshold or benefit from the leadership payments. Could it be everybody? Is there a limit? Will there be a cut-off point? Will it be applied at school level, at LEA level or nationally? How will it be done? If the Department does not know the answer to those questions, we shall find ourselves in a very odd world, in which everyone will be rewarded, everyone will be incentivised and no one will lose—except the taxpayer. It is supposed to be either a structured approach, genuinely to reward and motivate people, or a hidden uplift in the pay skills at large. It must be one or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the Minister to explain that at some length and in some detail, because the Committee must be satisfied before we sign ourselves up to the idea. We want to know that it is practical and focused, that it will achieve the intended results and that it will not lead to enormous additional costs to the Department and the taxpayer—unless the Minister and the Secretary of State anticipate that and have included it
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
in the Department's budget. I suppose, to boil it down, that I am really asking whether the Minister has the money to pay for it if it gets completely out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have those assurances, we may wish the scheme well and set it on its way. However, I shall take quite a bit of convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should declare an interest. Like many members of the Committee, I have been a teacher and seen the rivalry and pecking order in the staff room. Not only was I a classroom teacher, I was once the proud possessor of a special responsibility allowance for being in charge of the visual aids. I then rose to the dizzy heights of head of science, and was in possession of yet another allowance. I do not think that anyone outside Whitehall could have developed such a ridiculously complicated formula.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarification, and to ensure that we are all talking about the same thing, I understand that the formula does not have to be understood by the teachers.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon.

They will want to understand how the LEA made its decision. Those people who do not receive the extra allowance will be disgruntled about it, and there will be a them and us situation in the staff room—those who won the lottery and those who did not. That could be extremely damaging to the ethos of the school. We agree, I am sure, that many teachers are underpaid and that the formula and the process are a way of getting round paying the teaching profession better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely in favour, within the school, of the head teacher deciding on which staff deserve some form of extra payment, but I cannot imagine that any other employer, whether Tesco or Rothschild's bank, would adopt such a ludicrous system to pick out those who deserve that extra bit of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to bring some common sense into the debate. We do not deny that teachers should be paid well, because they do a difficult job, but to put them through a competition for such sums, based on what will inevitably be a subjective judgment by those who run the school, is an unnecessary expense and an unwieldy complication. As my right hon. and hon. Friends have pointed out, it is also extremely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
expensive. I am sure that the Minister, like everyone else, would prefer the money to go to the teachers rather than to the people who decide that the teachers are worthy of the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the supply teacher aspect. Those who are aware of what goes on in schools will know that supply teachers have been more in demand over the past few years, largely because they cannot find a place on the school's permanent payroll. All sorts of restraints are imposed by the quotas for teachers, which relate to the size of the school, the age of pupils and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formula gives some supply teachers extra money. What will that do to their chances of becoming full-time teachers? Schools want full-time staff and a few supply teachers to cover absences. I am worried that the teaching profession is developing a culture, which can be seen in other professions such as nursing, that rewards people who do part-time work to plug gaps in the system, which they would probably rather not do. How will that culture affect supply teaching? What effect will it have on the ability of schools to obtain their full quota or develop policies that will allow them to employ more full-time teachers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last but not least, the Minister should provide a guide to the formulae for teachers. Perhaps she has already done so. She will know, because she has taught, that there is a controversial element in the staff room among classroom teachers. It would be better if teachers knew that, having gone through their seven years of progress, they will be paid a sensible amount that rewards them for their experience, their willingness to remain in the profession and their status as professionals. They should not be scrabbling around for bits and pieces of extra money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indeed grateful to have been able to catch your eye, Mr. O'Hara, and I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my right hon. and hon. Friends have made excellent points, they did not cover everything. We need to be clear what the reports are trying to achieve. There are two tests to pass. We must determine whether teachers are entitled to performance-related pay before we can agree to the complicated formulae determining how much local authorities can be reimbursed. Of those two elements, I shall deal first with what tests teachers need to pass before they are entitled to the payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere obtained from a website the five tests that teachers will need to pass. They are professional knowledge and understanding; teaching and assessment; pupil progress; wider professional effectiveness; and professional characteristics. One begins to see that they are not objective but subjective tests, and every case will be different. How will each head teacher ensure that he or she is applying the criteria consistently and objectively?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The information helpfully goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>Independent assessors will ensure that the standards are fairly and consistently applied and will verify headteachers' decisions by sampling individual applications during Autumn term 2000 and Spring term 2001.</p></blockquote>
How can a relatively small sample determine whether the tests are applied consistently across all schools and teachers? That is not possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information illustrates that, to qualify for such payments, one would need to show that progress had been made in schools. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Looking at 2 or 3 representative groups of pupils, you need to describe pupils' prior attainment, expected progress and progress achieved. The evidence you will provide will vary according to the pupils. Where relevant you should use Key Stage test results end of year test results or examination data. You should look at examples of pupil progress over the last two or three years.</p></blockquote>
As if that were not sufficiently complicated, it continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>Where external assessments are not relevant, you will need to look at internal school assessments. SEN teachers will need to provide appropriate evidence of progress, which is appropriate to the pupils they teach. However, all teachers will be expected to show difference they have made to their pupils' progress.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Whatever evidence you use, it should be…verified by your headteacher or an external assessor.</p></blockquote>
In other words, the tests are a little like the five economic tests for joining the euro: they can mean all things to all people. It might be possible to make a case for every single teacher meeting the threshold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>The biggest teachers' union goes to court on Tuesday to challenge the way the government introduced the new performance-related pay system in England and Wales.</p></blockquote>
I did not have this piece of paper in my hand when I asked this question before. However, does my hon. Friend think that the fact that
	<br><blockquote><p>The National Union of Teachers has successfully applied for judicial review of an order introducing new professional duties for teachers</p></blockquote>
is symptomatic of the doubts that—as will surprise no Committee members—some teachers and their unions share with him about this approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Is it in order for us to discuss a matter that may be sub judice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that, until the matter is set down for trial, it is not sub judice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) will remember, he told me in response to an intervention that he would bounce the question back to the Minister. The Minister needs to address the important point that he raised. It is clear that the tests are extremely subjective, according to each teacher and head teacher, and there will be a lot
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
of room for argument. There will be many complaints and much unhappiness, and she must explain what sort of appeal mechanism there will be. We all know that there are teachers who, in one way or another, have slightly fallen out with their head teachers, or at least incurred their displeasure. There is plenty of room for discrimination by head teachers against individual teachers whom they dislike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend is right, and the matter will be challenged in the courts on judicial review, the Minister will have to demonstrate clearly to Committee members how she envisages that the appeal mechanisms will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because he has raised the point that may lie behind the legal challenge that has been mounted by the National Union of Teachers. In the Minister's view, what will be the effect on morale and teamwork in schools of the requirement for fellow teachers to help head teachers to assess their colleagues? Of course, there is the further question of the additional work that is created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point, because it brings me to the next chapter in my speech. It seems that the whole mechanism, complicated as it is, will tend to favour successful schools and teachers. Unsuccessful schools will be at a disadvantage, because it will be more difficult for them to demonstrate added value. Anyone can look at published test results, unless the basis of the tests is changed, and it is easy to see how many A and B grades were obtained. One needs to look at the standard of pupils, work out the potential added value and then see whether the teachers are meeting that added value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the Minister to say that it is nonsense, but it is not. If the subjective tests are to be applied, that is precisely the reasoning that will need to be investigated. If the Minister thinks that that is nonsense, perhaps she will save the Committee from my next chapter by intervening now and explaining why I am wrong. She has not done so, so obviously I am correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the Committee will have to hear the next chapter of my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My colleagues and I have considered many statutory instruments and we have seen how the huge amount of bureaucracy has affected head teachers in particular. I visit head teachers in my constituency and they are swamped with paperwork. I heard the other day that secondary school head teachers have had 2,461 documents imposed on them by the Government since the general election, which they are supposed to have read and implemented in addition to all the other duties involved in administration of their schools. Unless they are incredibly fortunate, few of them have
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
any time left for teaching, which is very sad. We are imposing so much bureaucracy on our primary and secondary school head teachers that they never have the opportunity to go into the classroom and learn about the problems facing their pupils and how difficult they are finding it to cope with all the changes that the Government are imposing on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to discuss this statutory instrument, because I am not sure how the head teachers will have time to cope with the assessments and the appeals that are bound to follow. They will probably need to employ more administrative staff. My right hon. and hon. Friends referred to compliance costs and we need to know how much teacher time is expected to be taken up by the provisions. Teachers will presumably be entitled to calculate the extra payments during school time, because there is no reason why they should have to use their precious leisure time, so more supply teachers will have to be employed. Head teachers will not have time to do it, so they will have to have more administrative staff and support. Then we come to the formula and the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like my hon. Friend to try to imagine the formula being applied in the context of Back Benchers in this place—the rank and file equivalent of teachers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That takes us somewhat beyond the bounds of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be absolutely in order and I want to draw my comments to a close. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay for her intervention, but I shall not be tempted. Indeed, Mr. O'Hara, you would rule me out of order if I were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask one or two questions about the formula. I refer the Minister to page 4 of the document, which states that the monthly payments will commence on 15 August 2000, but the calculations on page 5 will start from 1 September 2000. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain where the missing fortnight has gone. I should also like the Minister to explain why the initial formula applies only from 1 September 2000 to 31 March 2001, after which we shall have to move to a completely new regime. I assume that that will mean that all the payments, computers and everything else will have to be altered on 1 April next year. Why is it necessary to have two completely different sections? Will the Minister also explain what is to happen after 31 August 2001? Will the regime continue to apply, or are we likely to have new legislation and a whole new regime?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like the Minister to provide the compliance costs for local authorities—as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst also mentioned—so that we can see exactly how much they will need to administer the scheme. Will they be fully reimbursed for the costs that they have to pay out to schools? What will be the time lag involved? If they are paying money towards their debt, how much extra interest will be incurred by delays in payments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Finally, how many extra staff will be employed by the Department for Education and Employment to administer the grants? Will the costs involved come out of the Minister's existing budget or will she be given additional money in the expenditure review that we are about to undergo, in order to meet the cost of implementing this statutory instrument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a bureaucratic nightmare. I hope, frankly, that the NUT wins its case, and that the whole provision is chucked out so that we can go back to the drawing board and start again. We should go back to a system described by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay when she said, "Let us give the money to the head teachers. Let us trust them for once, and let them reward their teachers in the way that they see fit."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.41 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has become clear from the debate that if the Tories were in power, teachers would not get this pay rise. The notion that the previous Government would have given the money to head teachers and trusted them to pay their teachers simply does not stand up when we look at the evidence of that Government's actions over teachers' pay. In the last three years under the auspices of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst—it was a different constituency in those days—there were staged pay increases, rarely as much as we have given in the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most interesting point raised today was raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold, and I give warning that I should be happy to give way to the hon. Member for Hertsmere if he would like to take this opportunity to contradict him. The hon. Member for Cotswold has just said that he hoped that the NUT would win its judicial review, and that we would have to start again. We must be clear what that would mean. It would mean that all the effort and good work that the teachers have put into filling in and assessing the threshold applications, and all the work that the assessors have begun to do to verify them, would have to be scrapped and burnt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has just made it clear that, under a Conservative Government, teachers would not get their £2,000 pay increase. I should be happy to give way at this moment, because I should welcome clarification from the hon. Member for Hertsmere as to whether it is the policy of the official Opposition that the NUT should succeed, and that teachers should not receive their pay increase from September.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the remaining available time, we should like to hear some answers from the Minister. I shall turn to her remarks in due course, if there is time at the end of her speech. However, she has been speaking for some time and has not yet answered a single question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that there has been no contradiction from the hon. Member for Hertsmere to the view that, if the Tories were in our position, they would not let the 197,000 eligible teachers who have worked hard to put in their application receive their
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
£2,000 pay increase. That would be the consequence of the NUT winning its judicial review that finished yesterday. I am glad that we have settled that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has criticised me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just been criticised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere for not answering questions. I have not been left much time in which to do that, and I am sure that members of the Committee will appreciate my wish to get on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst raised the crucial question. To some extent, a judgment will be made about whether this process recruits and retains. That is the central question. If it does, it will have been worth while, and I suspect that even the right hon. Gentleman might, perhaps grudgingly, acknowledge that it will have done some good. I think that it will make a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this is not the only provision that we have made in terms of recruitment. The right hon. Gentleman will be aware of the fast-track proposal contained in the Green Paper, the training salaries, the chance to double-jump increments, the new leadership college and the enhanced status of the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision will make a difference in two ways. For too long, pay promotion has been available to teachers only if they take on administrative posts. It was interesting that the extra points awarded to the hon. Member for Billericay were for being head of the science department and manager of visual aids. My points were for managing a team of teachers who taught 16 plus. Between the two of us, we got quite a lot of money on top of our basic teacher's salary, but none of the things for which we got it was about teaching well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always depressed me that the salary structure for the teaching profession is so good at rewarding leadership, administrative responsibilities and management, as it did the hon. Member for Billericay and me. The previous Government acknowledged that there was a problem and introduced performance points. The trouble was that only 0.4 per cent. of people ever took them up; they did not fly, they did not work. However, that Government had acknowledged that what was wrong with the pay system was that it did not reward good classroom teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to address the central issue, as raised by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. For the first time, we have a system that pays more for teaching well. That is crucial, because the most important job in teaching is done in the classroom with the kids. Nothing that anyone in this place does will matter if a teacher does not teach well. We must change the culture; we must say to teachers, "If you like kids and you like teaching, stay in the classroom and we will pay you more." No Government have ever done that successfully, but any improvement in retention rates will rest on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I think that our system will improve retention, because it gives a message to aspirant teachers who teach well that they will not be forced to leave the classroom for promotion. It also gives aspirants the message that, if they are good, they will be rewarded financially, rather than just getting a pat on the head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an observation that is based on anecdotal evidence but with which no teacher whom I have ever met would disagree. If teachers in a particular school are asked to list those of their colleagues whom they consider to be excellent, there will be a high level of agreement. There will, however, be little agreement between that list and a list showing the money paid to each member of staff in the school. Does the Minister agree that people are paid for carrying out administrative tasks, not for being good at their job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, although I am not implying that the hon. Member for Billericay did not deserve her two extra responsibility points. Everyone knows that the good classroom teachers are often not the best paid, but we will change that: teaching is about teaching. People should be paid for taking on managerial and administrative responsibilities, but they should also be paid for teaching well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us discuss the formula. If I were a suspicious type, I might think that the questions about the formula were a smokescreen to disguise a lack of understanding of the policy, but I am not, so I will honour my obligations to answer. It is simple: there are not many variables. The first constant is that every teacher above the threshold gets £2,001. The second is that 17.8 per cent. will be added on for the extra cost, which answers the question put by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. There are no halves; people will not half pass—that is what they will get. The other constant is that there are 12 months in a year, and we will pay the money monthly. The variable is the number of people who will get through the threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formula looks complicated because we intend to pay the money to the local authorities on 15 August on the basis that everyone got through. That means that local authorities will be able to guarantee that schools will have the money the minute they get the results of their assessments, which they will not have in August. I would not be happy with a situation in which schools have to wait for six months before they got their money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no quota. I have always said that I would be surprised if most people got through. Let us assume that, in the months that follow, we have to adjust any further payments in the light of the numbers of people in each local authority who get through, which is a variable. The schools will each fill in one form listing the names of the members of staff who are above the threshold. In return, they will receive through the normal channels an amount equal to the number of staff, which is the variable, multiplied by 2,001, which is the constant, plus 17.8 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The other difficulty in dealing with variables relates to supply teachers. Supply teachers do not stay in one classroom. We do not want a head teacher to have to send 2,001, plus 17.8, divided by two and a half days, to the next school. We have therefore asked heads to let us know at the end of each term how much money they have spent on paying supply teachers the threshold element of their salary, and we send that to them. That is all that the formula involves. It contains no trick, and no variables will apply from the teacher's point of view. They will have no extra work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to reassure the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) about consultation. As ever, the formula is better for our having consulted. We consulted the LGA, teacher unions, the National Employers Organisation for School Teachers and anyone else whom we thought appropriate. The LGA is helping us trial the claims form in authorities in the vanguard assessors, which include Bradford. Such proposals are always better for having been consulted on, and we have ensured that we do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next important point is whether all will get through or none will get through. I agree with the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that there is no point in setting up the scheme if everyone gets through. We might as well give them a £2,000 increase. I do not want to do that, because the scheme has a deeper purpose. It is designed to reward good classroom practice and change the culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to do as the hon. Member for Cotswold suggests and leave the decision to heads. When he rose a second time, he told us about heads who had fallen out with their teachers, when the first time he rose he said that we should trust the heads. Given such circumstances, we should build in safety mechanisms and checks to protect teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standards that we have introduced are rigorous. I regret that the hon. Member for Cotswold read them out in an almost ridiculing way, because they are the essence of good teaching. They relate to marking, preparation, assessment, encouraging, children progressing, contribution to professional development, supporting staff and teamwork. They should not be derided, because they relate to what teachers do day in and day out in schools in this country. If teachers pass the threshold, that is a sign of professionalism and an achievement, and no one in the Committee or elsewhere should speak of those criteria in a way that undermines that achievement. If they pass, good on them; it is a massive achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having set the thresholds, we must ensure that they are interpreted equally and fairly in schools—a difficult task. We have taken several measures so far. We have invited all head teachers to a day's training, followed by half a day, and have made available helplines and as much as possible to help them through the first challenging and sometimes difficult year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also trained assessors to go into schools, work with heads and check assessments. In that way, we are leaving the decision to the head, but because, as the hon. Member for Cotswold said, some head teachers fall out with their staff, an assessor will be available to offer security to classroom teachers who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
fear that that might happen. The other beauty of assessors is that they will see different schools interpreting the standards, and in that way I hope that we shall achieve uniformity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial to build the scheme on a performance management system. Hon. Members may laugh about the amount of time involved, but it is tragic that the schools that have the most difficulty in implementing the system are those that have no performance management system. The previous Government left performance management in schools in a state of disarray. They tried and failed. It collapsed through lack of financial support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also introducing a performance management system so that teachers are assessed every year. Head teachers will become used to observing their teachers, as I believe they should; at the threshold, they will look at the sum of the annual performance management statement. The application form will merely support the judgment that good head teachers make. That is how it should be: regular observation, good feedback and a chance, after seven years in the profession, for teachers to mark their careers as professionals and receive 2,000 quid into the deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister distorts what I have said and goes on to say that I had a good point. Will she tell the Committee what recourse a disgruntled teacher will have who has been granted an award that he or she thinks unfair? Will such a teacher have recourse to an independent assessor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no formal appeals mechanism, but a teacher can reapply the next year. If teachers are disgruntled, they have the knowledge that the assessor as well as the head teacher will look at the application form. Assessors look at all paper applications and do a sample of 20 per cent. in each school, along with the head teacher. I do not know how long that will take—it depends on the number of applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered carefully the question of building in an assessment procedure, but we felt that, given the way that life is, the time for reapplication the following year would arrive before the assessment was heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister clarify whether the money goes with the teacher if he or she decides to move on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does indeed. Teachers above the threshold become part of the figure that claims the money, so each school applies for the number of threshold teachers and the number of £2,001 cases that it has. That is crucial, because otherwise the school might not be able to take those teachers who were above the threshold, for financial reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not intending, through the measure, to sneak through a massive £2,000 pay increase for teachers or make divisions in the pay structure. It is an honest, decent attempt to create a pay structure that, for the first time, recognises and rewards good classroom practice. The measure says to teachers, "We value you and know that you are doing a crucial job, and we are prepared to put money into the pockets of good classroom teachers".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
This year is the most difficult one for the scheme because there are more than 250,000 eligible teachers—there will never be such a large number again. I hope that it goes smoothly. There is bound to be the odd hiccup but all the signs are good. I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere does not seek to withhold from good teachers the opportunity for a £2,000 pay increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst said, this has been a nostalgic occasion and we have had flashbacks to past events involving the Minister and himself. I hope that the Minister will take what I say in good part but, after listening to her speech, and especially to the opening remarks, on which she spent some time, I thought that she was happier asking my right hon. Friend questions than she was giving answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asks whether we wish the system well. We have heard a lot from the Government, and from her today, about aspirations. We have heard an account of how she hoped that the system would work. However, she was—uncharacteristically, for her—unable to give us factual answers to our questions. For example, she was unable to tell us how much the system would cost, how much it would cost to train the head teachers and to train and employ the assessors. She could not tell us how much time she expects teachers and head teachers to spend on the applications and whether teachers are expected to take part in the assessments for their fellow teachers conducted by the head teacher. Although she claimed that the formulae were simple and that she knew what the constants and variables would be, she could not give us a figure that would come out at the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is because there are variables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the Government are again unable to come up with straightforward answers to straightforward questions does not bode well for the system, which is a complex one. We do not in any sense wish it ill, but we must ask the questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance Special Grant Report (No. 67) on Heads', Deputies' and Advanced Skills Teachers' Performance Pay Progression and Deputies' Assimilation (House of Commons Paper No. 569).</p></blockquote>
The first element of the special grant report concerns support for the award of additional pay points to heads, deputies and advanced skills teachers in respect of their performance in a previous academic year. The grant is intended to support the cost to school budgets of such awards, thus ensuring that achievement among heads, deputies and advanced skills teachers is recognised more consistently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant will form 60 per cent. of the cost of the additional pay point awarded to a head, deputy or advanced skills teacher in the academic year 2000–01 as a result of performance in the previous academic year, and 30 per cent. of the cost of the same point in the period September 2001 to March 2002, when the grant comes to an end. It will also fund 60 per cent. of the cost of any additional pay points that are awarded to a head, deputy or advanced skills teacher from September 2001 as a result of performance in the previous academic year. At the end of each calendar year, local authorities will submit to the Department the number of staff who qualify for payments under the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second element of the grant report will provide £900 in academic year 2000–01, and £540 in academic year 2001–02, in respect of each deputy head assimilating from their current pay spine to the new leadership pay spine, with effect from 1 September 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to introduce greater support for the teaching profession, and I commend the report to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that she will not ask me how much that comes to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Special grant report No.67 has two purposes, which the Minister briefly outlined. I do not propose to repeat them at any great length, save to say that the first purpose relates to local authority expenditure on the additional salary costs of performance pay for the members of the profession whom the Minister described as heads, deputies and advanced skills teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever, we seek clarification from the Minister on one or two points. I hope that we will receive answers that are slightly more factual than those that she has given so far. In the previous debate, she made great play of the claim that the Government are funding every part of the expenditure on performance related pay. We note that, under the grant, the Government are contributing 60 per cent. towards the cost of such performance points. How will the remaining 40 per cent. be met?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will carry out assessments on the deputy heads and advanced skills teachers? Does the Minister have any estimate of the total amount of the grant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In again asking the question "how much?"—I do not think that we have received an answer to any of those that we have asked so far—we come to the formula. My right hon. and hon. Friends drew attention to the nature of the calculations in special grant report No. 66. If they turn to paragraph 6, on page 5 of the report, they will see what I can only describe as the big daddy of mathematical formulae. It makes the others look piddling. For the benefit of the Committee, I shall, using my limited mathematical skills, endeavour to read out how the first year cost will be calculated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are told in annexe C that funding will be

and will
	<br><blockquote><p>continue at a set rate of £540 for each deputy during the following academic year.</p></blockquote>
We would like to know whether that will apply to all deputy heads, whether the figure of £900 includes on-costs, what the on-costs will amount to in each case if that is so and whether the Minister can give us an estimate of how much the cost of this part of special grant No.67 will be in total.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the conclusions of the Committee is that not only should hon. Members have numeracy classes, but that we should have classics classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Page 9 of the document almost strains credulity when it says that
	<br><blockquote><p>The new grants further the key objectives set out in the Green Paper "Teachers: Meeting the Challenge of Change".</p></blockquote>
To my mind, that has a familiar ring. I think—you may be able to correct me, Mr. O'Hara—that "Meet the challenge, make the change" was a slogan that was going to lead Mr. Neil Kinnock to triumph in 1992. I thought that the Labour party had changed itself sufficiently to leave those dark days behind. I wonder what bright spark in the Department reached back into his or her political memory to come up with that triumphant title for the Green Paper. I bet that it was one of the special advisers whom we keep hearing about, not the Minister. It certainly was not any officials. I hope that the phrase does not bode the same way as it did in 1992.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In the case of the Labour party under Neil Kinnock, the change followed the challenge. In the case of the Green Paper, the challenge seems to follow the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. I shall leave it to the Committee to decide whether it gets the Minister off the hook. I simply wanted to reinforce the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, which was about the figure of 60 per cent. We were able to be reassured by the Minister in the previous debate that, whatever the cost of the scheme, it would be met in full by the Department. I do not want to go over all that ground again, although I hope that the Minister might write to my hon. Friend with details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If only either 60 per cent. or, for a limited time, 30 per cent. of the scheme will be paid in full, it is obvious to ask whether we assume that the rest of the awards will be picked up by the school or, in combination with it, the local education authority. If so, will that tend to inhibit implementing the scheme and making the awards? On the other hand, if the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
awards are made in full and given to as many people as merit them, where will the money come from and what else in the school budget or authority budget will suffer as a result? In this regard, the Minister will have to be both honest and imaginative. In writing her blank cheque, she was proof against criticism first time round. This time, the amount is limited, so I hope that we shall get straight and simple answers to these questions. How does the Minister explain the 60 per cent. figure? More important, how does she explain the result of that figure and its impact at individual school and authority level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing that we have learned today is that there are many former teachers in the House of Commons. It appears that most of them are not former maths teachers, which is probably the best news that we have had today, given the current shortage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever, the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asks a crucial question. It is clear that levers form a different approach, but in neither instance do they constitute a blank cheque. Writing blank cheques would create potential difficulties and would not change the system with the rigor that we seek. The threshold payments contain a check, but it is not guided by the amount of money available. In grant No. 66, the lever that prevents the writing of a blank cheque is the rigorous assessment of national standards. That is the Government's safety valve, which prevents abuse of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of grant No. 67, we are discussing promotional points for heads and deputy heads. The right hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that, even under his Government, governing bodies always retained the right to decide how to spend their delegated budget. Where a head is promoted and raised by a point on the scale, the money involved cannot then be spent on children. Such decisions must always be taken, and everyone must work within a budget. Under the right hon. Gentleman's Government, it was clear that, where a head teacher was promoted and moved one point up the promotional scale, not a penny was made available to help. Tough decisions had to be made, and money had to be spent on the head's promotional point, rather than the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not written a blank cheque; instead, we have built in a lever. We support the decision to award a promotional point, and governing bodies will make such awards rigorously and properly because they, too, must make a financial contribution. We will pay 60 per cent. of a point in the first year, and 30 per cent. of the same point in the second year, as well as 60 per cent. of any new point. That will provide freedom, and send the message that we want governing bodies to use the pay structure to reward good head teachers. However, those bodies must also be responsible. We are talking about the way in which the nation spends its education budget, and bodies will not simply come to us and say, "We've done it, we've given another promotional point", because they, too, must pay money into the system.

	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
As ever, it is a question of checks and balances. Our check in grant No. 66 is the rigorous application of national standards. Our check in grant No. 67 is that both the governing bodies and us are paying into the kitty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may not be sufficient guidance for governing bodies and heads. Why are they being provided with full funding for assistant heads but not deputy heads, when in both cases the criteria will be, for example, performance and assumption of responsibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are three points there. The hon. Gentleman asked about assistant heads and deputy heads. Assistant heads are part of the leadership group that was discussed in grant No. 66. In respect of deputy heads, for whom there is a new pay scale, we funded the promotional points that could be based on last year's performance in the same way as the heads' promotional point was handled, and we allowed some money for transfer to a new pay scale. The heads' new
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
salary scale was introduced last year, but the deputy heads' new salary scale was introduced this year, which adds extra complexity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also crucial to establish who will make the assessment—it will be the governing body. The local authority is the only other body that could have made the assessment, but we decided that it would not have been right for it do so. I am sure that no one would suggest that it should be done centrally. A grant has been made available to governing bodies so that they can use one of our trained advisers. The process is that a governing body will have its choice of an adviser from our approved list, who will be trained to help it to appraise the head. He will be invited to work in a subcommittee and to go over the head's targets, evaluate his performance and reflect his performance in his pay.
