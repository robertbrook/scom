	<p>[MR. EDWARD O'HARA 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Education Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am sure that you will have been briefed by now on the events that took place at our previous sitting. You will probably be aware that there was utter chaos on the Government's side about what should have transpired. Apparently, the Whip was due to move that we adjourn our deliberations until later in the day, but that did not happen. The Minister did not seem to know what was happening during the Division, and confusion reigned in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can you confirm, Mr. O'Hara, that the reason why the Government were let off the hook, given their abysmal effort to consider new clause 4, was due entirely to a procedural problem? At the time, the Committee should have been allowed two votes—first, on whether the new clause should be read a second time and, secondly, on whether it should stand part of the Bill. The Committee deserves an explanation of what happened because we left this morning's sitting totally confused, which was due simply to the ineptitude of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I read out the information that I have been given about what happened in my absence this morning. There does indeed seem to have been a certain amount of confusion at the end of this morning's sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that shortly before 1 p.m. the debate was concluded on amendment No. 178 and the Committee divided on that amendment. My co-Chairman, Sir Michael Shersby, was then expecting a procedural motion to be made by the Government Whip. As that did not happen, he was bound in the short time remaining to proceed with the business. The Committee accordingly agreed that clause 18 should stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Michael then proceeded to try to deal with new clause 4 in the name of Mr. Kilfoyle and others, which had been called for decision only. Indeed, I remember grouping the debate on that new clause with a debate on amendment No. 92 to clause 4. In the heat of the moment, Sir Michael inadvertently put the Question on new clause 4 in the wrong form. He put the Question, That the clause be "added to the Bill" when initially, of course, the Chairman should have put the Question, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once it had become clear that the Question on the new clause had been wrongly put in procedural terms, Sir Michael decided that the Question on new clause 4 should be put again. He then put the Question in its
	<span class='label label-info column'>374</span>
proper form—That the clause be read a Second time—and that was negatived without a Division. That is the information that I have received about the events which took place in my absence this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the Chairman's ruling. I advise the Committee that it is always open to the Chair to rerun a vote if there was any doubt about its outcome or if the Question had been wrongly proposed. By the end of this morning's sitting, the Committee had taken a clear decision on new clause 4 and I do not think that any further points of order arise on this matter. I suggest that we now proceed with our business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On an entirely different point of order, Mr. O'Hara. You may or may not have seen newspaper reports at the weekend, which apparently emanated from the Secretary of State for National Heritage. Can you confirm that the lady sitting opposite me is the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, not Cherie Gillam, the well-known page 3 girl? I do not want any misunderstanding about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order. The technical description of it is political point-scoring which was made before I could stop it. I suggest that we now proceed with the business of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>EXTENSION OF ASSISTED PLACES SCHEME TO SCHOOLS PROVIDING ONLY PRIMARY EDUCATION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 17, line 5, after 'education)', insert 'for'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 170, in page 17, line 6, leave out 'shall be omitted' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'there shall be substituted the words "providing education conforming to the provisions as to—

	<ol>

	<li>the National Curriculum and assessment as prescribed under Chapter II of Part V to the Education Act 1996;</li>

	<li>the reporting of the results of assessment under that Chapter;</li>

	<li>inspection under the School Inspections Act 1996;</li>

	<li>the vetting of criminal records of potential employees under Part V to the Police Act 1997.".'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to be your unhappy lot, Mr. O'Hara, to miss the more exciting parts of our proceedings. Our Divisions seem rather like grant-maintained ballot votes—one carries on voting until one gets the right answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure greater accountability of schools in the assisted places scheme. It is unfortunate that the Minister of State has left the Room as I shall quote what he said to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)—whom I think I can call an hon. Friend—in our sitting last Thursday. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I enjoyed the hon. Gentleman's speech as most of it consisted of my words."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D, 5 December 1996; c. 303.</i>]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>375</span>
I shall quote quite a few of his words. In fact, I can do better than that—I seek to put his words, in a paraphrased form, in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments place an obligation on independent schools to have an academic audit based on the national curriculum, involving testing on all the elements that make up the academic audit for maintained schools. The amendments would also demonstrate the huge inconsistencies in Government policy in regard to maintained and independent and private schools. I draw the comparison because not only are maintained schools maintained by state funding, but many independent and private schools are maintained in part—some in great part—by taxpayers' money. The assisted places scheme consumes a considerable amount of taxpayers' money each year: currently in excess of £100 million. The Government intend to double that figure—the Prime Minister made it clear earlier this year that he wanted twice as much to be spent on the scheme. Although the proposal does not form part of the Bill, we know that taxpayers' money will go into independent and private schools through schemes such as the service boarding school allowance, which attracted £110 million last year. There are similar schemes operated by Government Departments—particularly the Foreign Office, which devotes a considerable amount of money to such schemes to allow children to receive a boarding education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not oppose the service boarding school allowance, but there should be far greater accountability. I shall not dwell on that further, other than to say that if one adds the figures for other schemes to those for the assisted places schemes, the amount of taxpayers' money being spent in independent and private schools is probably nearer £350 million a year. There should be more careful financial accountability of those funds, and academic accountability. Some of the schools in the assisted places scheme receive substantial sums of taxpayers' money. The first major inconsistency in the Government's argument is that they say so much more money is needed for private education than for state education. Many private schools—I shall give a list in a moment—are receiving substantially more than maintained schools in the same area are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give some figures, so that the Committee has an idea of the size of the problem. They do not include any parental contributions that may be attracted in addition to the taxpayers' contribution. It is unfortunate that the Minister of State is not present at the moment, as I notice that the Royal grammar school in Worcester received £914,000 last year under the assisted places scheme; there are 270 pupils, so that works out at £3,385 per pupil. I wonder whether maintained schools in Worcester receive similar amounts. Last year, Trinity school of John Whitgift received £549,000 for 148 pupils—that is £3,710 per pupil. The Sutton Valence school in the Sutton area—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I should like to finish my list, as I do not want the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to miss my point. The Sutton Valence School in the Sutton area received £428,000 for 74 pupils, which is £5,789 per pupil.—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam says that it is not in her area; given the school's name, I thought that she might be interested in the figures none the less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) is talking to the hon. Lady; as an accountant and a man of figures, who interests himself in such matters, he will know that last year, Dover college received £140,672 for 27 pupils—that is £5,210 per pupil. In addition, there is probably some parental contribution. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman says, "So what?" I shall tell him so what: in his area, there is a secondary modern school, the Astor school, which receives on average only £2,200 per pupil. Why is it that those independent schools are being funded at two and a half times the level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the list of figures that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) is giving, but will he tell the Committee whether his figures for the maintained schools include overheads and capital costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to answer that. The figure of £2,200 did not include them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A queue is forming, so perhaps Committee members will be patient. After I have finished my point, I shall give way to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and then to the hon. Member for Dover—and then to anyone else who cares to intervene. The Minister asked about other costs; the Astor school receives perhaps another 10 per cent.—another £220—which makes a total of £2,400.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The hon. Gentleman said that he would give way to me in a minute, but I will not have him saying—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I inform the hon. Member for Dover that I shall determine who shall be allowed to say what.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I protest? The hon. Gentleman is picking figures out of the air—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order. If the hon. Member for Dover wants to take issue with any statistics that are cited, he will have the opportunity to do so in the normal course of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Dover is impatient; I shall give way to him in a moment, as I said I would. I look forward to his apology for giving inaccurate figures the other week. Now that I have

	<span class='label label-info column'>377</span>
given the right figures, that matter has been cleared up once and for all. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is chomping at the bit, so I give way to her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How is it that the hon. Gentleman likes to be likened to a dog in a manger, but wants to deny able children the chance of the very best education to develop their capabilities? Does he agree that those children have special needs, just as do other children in different categories? To deny them the very best opportunities is grossly unfair. If he intends to deny those opportunities and bring all those children back into the mainstream sector, how will he find enough school places? How will he fund that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the hon. Lady the answer to the last question: we shall determine it when we are in Government. The difference between the hon. Lady and us in that we want the best education for all children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. I remind my hon. Friend that there is a queue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) justify the fact that a child on the assisted places scheme receives two and a half to three times as much from the taxpayer as children in state schools in her constituency? We can be sure that £1 extra given to a maintained school is £1 that is not available for another school. Perhaps the hon. Lady will explain to the maintained schools in her area, many of which are excellent, why she supports money being taken from them and given to private and independent schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now give way to the hon. Member for Dover, who is absolutely bursting to make a point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way; I appreciate that he has a lot to say, but I should like to place on record that he was wrong before—he tried to compare 1993 figures with 1995 figures—and he is wrong now. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, the figures that the hon. Gentleman gave do not include capital. During the past fortnight, I visited the Astor school and was pleased to see its new gym, theatre and other buildings, the cost of which totalled about £3 million or about £7,000 per pupil. Those sums are not included in the hon. Gentleman's figures. It is just not correct to say that the adjustment figure for capital is £200.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has told us how good the Astor school is and what a good job the LEA is doing supporting it. I know that he attended the opening of that school's excellent new buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman accused me of comparing years that are not alike. Perhaps I can help him. In 1993, Dover college received £86,605 for 18 pupils, or £4,811 per pupil. In that year, only 40 per cent. of its pupils gained five grades A to C. All those figures connect.
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
We all celebrate improvement and we are delighted to note that that school, taking a leaf from the book of the excellent comprehensives and secondary moderns in the area, has levered up its standards. This year, 67 per cent. of its pupils gained those grades. One might ask why 33 per cent. of the children in an independent, selective school did not gain five grades A to C, as they might have done in other schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that the statement made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said it all—the Conservative party's view is that state education is second class? Given such a statement, does not my hon. Friend agree that it is scandalous for the Conservative party to be guardians of the education of our children—the future community and society, which we want to create? Does he also agree that the fact that there are 65 schools in the assisted places scheme where tuition fees are more than £6,000 per pupil represents a scandalous abuse in that resources are not being husbanded effectively to ensure that we get value for money from our investment in education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for making those points. She is absolutely right. Conservative Members are not trying to improve education for all children. It is clear from what was said by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that they are looking for escape routes for a few, not for the genuine benefit of the many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme needs much greater auditing. The hon. Member for Dover told us that he is an accountant. Perhaps he will give us the benefit of his experience, later in the debate or in another intervention, and say whether it is acceptable for a body to consider and vet applications when the body itself is the recipient of the funds. That is how the assisted places scheme works: the school vets the applications, receives information from the parents, then decides whether it should receive funds under the assisted places scheme—in other words, whether the funds should be remitted. Can the hon. Gentleman say—he is thinking hard, I can see—where else in the accountancy world a body is allowed to do that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, but I believe that such applications should be considered independently and separately by a competent body, not by the schools themselves. Yet the schools are doing just that, which unfortunately leaves the door open for the misuse of funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is probably a convenient moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My thoughts, like yours, Mr. O'Hara, are elsewhere; we would much prefer to meet the mayor of Famagusta than to be here.

The hon. Gentleman says that it is quite wrong that a body that receives money from its pupils or students should select its own pupils or students. Is he therefore saying that universities and places of higher education,

	<span class='label label-info column'>379</span>
which are remunerated in part by reference to the number of their students, should be subject to external audit? If so, some universities are behaving quite disgracefully in lowering their entrance qualifications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman does not understand how the Higher Education Funding Council works. It has the oversight of universities, but there is no comparison between that and schools. Independent schools are not overseen by or accountable to a Government body; by their very nature, they are stand-alone establishments. They should not vet individual applications from parents and make decisions according to possible funding. The hon. Gentleman must accept that that is clearly open to abuse. I am looking forward to the hon. Member for Dover telling us whether that happens in other areas of public life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition's constant attacks on Dover college are interesting—that college has clearly been singled out. Does the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Dover college is a perfectly respectable establishment. I am saying that there is no proper accountability for how the money is spent. If Dover college is as excellent as the hon. Gentleman tells us, the amendment should hold no fears for it. The college will come to us with open arms; if the hon. Gentleman contacts it, it will write to him saying that it would be happy to have a full audit of its accounts and an independent body to scrutinise parental applications. It will operate the national curriculum, allow itself to be Ofsted-ed and everything else as well. This is not an attack on Dover college. When I first mentioned a school in the constituency of the hon. Member for Dover, I did not mention its name. He was the one who put the hat on Dover college. He will find that that is correct if he checks 
	<i>Hansard.</i>

As I was saying, the system is wide open to abuse. Wealthy people can find their way through the system. An article in 
	<i>The Sunday Times</i> on 12 November 1995 referred to the few wealthy families who take advantage of the assisted places scheme. It mentioned a John and Frances Freeman who admitted that they could afford to pay. Even though the couple had saved £30,000 for fees, their daughter Hannah and son Jamie had assisted places at a £4,200 a year public school. The Freemans, who have a listed farmhouse at the end of a private drive in the pretty village of Holcombe Rogus, run a building business. They own an Arabian horse, two ponies, a paddock and a stable block. The family said that they had not cut back on luxuries as their children's school fees were paid by the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is just one example of a clear abuse. The parents were prepared to admit to a national newspaper that they had abused the scheme. One headmaster of a top public school in Scotland said that he knew at least two big landowners who claimed to be impoverished farmers. Neil Gamble, the headmaster of Exeter School in Devon, said that a quarter of his 705 pupils were on assisted places and that some of the parents indulged in "creative accounting". David Jewell, head of the £12,720 a year Haileybury School in Hertford, said that about 20 per cent. of applications for assisted places were incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall in a moment. I just want to draw the attention of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to the comments made by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Walden), who sits on the Conservative Benches. On 29 October this year, during
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>381</span>
the Queen's Speech debate on education and local government, when talking about the assisted places scheme, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unfortunately, in practice many of the crumbs are intercepted by the agile hands of the middle classes. It is no use for Ministers to tell me that 80 per cent. of the recipients of assisted places schemes have below average incomes."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 October 1996; Vol. 284, c. 492.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the hon. Member for Buckingham agrees with us. He is probably in a better position to know than most of us in the Committee because he used to be a Minister in the Department for Education and Science.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend comment on the further research carried out by Professor Edwards when he talked to head teachers of private schools that had benefited financially from the assisted places scheme? I shall quote two examples. The first head teacher said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think there are self-employed people with good accountants who do extremely well from it. I know, we have someone here … who was the only daughter of a family where there were three, if not four, sons and they were all in independent schools and she came here, her father was a barrister at law, they lived in Riverside, they had a Volvo"—</p></blockquote>
[HON. MEMBERS: "It must be Tony Blair."] Interestingly, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has no Volvo. The head went on to say that

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving quotations on which I want my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport to comment. The second quotation is also from a head teacher, who says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"one of the things that we have found irritating is…paying for people's divorces, you know there are occasions when, because a mother is living with but not married to another chap, who will not take responsibilities for the fees, then because of her income or lack of it then she's eligible.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment; let me deal with the previous point before we go further. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam may also know of the findings
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
of Tapper and Salter, whose research on the assisted places scheme was published in the 
	<i>Journal of Educational Policy.</i> They said that there was
	<br><blockquote><p>"no evidence to suggest that the Assisted Places Scheme is being administered by the schools in a manner that targets categories of children from deprived educational or social backgrounds".</p></blockquote>
Perhap the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam knows differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has given way, as I want to kill off the red herring in his ridiculous pursuit of class war. Is he aware that 42 per cent. of assisted places are awarded to children who come from families with an income of less than £9,800? Indeed, the average income of families with children on the scheme is £10,600. How can he suggest that the system is riddled with privilege and middle-class manoeuvring? He should reflect on the fact that the scheme can give opportunities and he should withdraw his ridiculous remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady does her homework more thoroughly, she will find that although the demonstrable income of many of the families is probably less than £9,000 a year, that disguises the fact that they have large assets—a farmhouse or large holding, for example. As one of the head teachers pointed out, a little bit of creative accounting from self-employed people can make it seem that they are earning substantially less than they are. I do not accept the hon. Lady's point, as I do not think that she has done her research. If she had, she would find that what I am saying is the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman was wrong and the statistics of my hon. Friend the Minister for Sutton and Cheam were absolutely correct, would he accept that the scheme is worth while and helps low-income families? I am informed that many of the pupils on the Dover college scheme have single, never-married mothers who are bringing up children on low incomes and social security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that point as there is no evidence to show that it is true. If the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should not Conservative Members read the answers to parliamentary questions, particularly that asked by the hon. Member for Buckingham? He wanted to know whether ownership of a house worth £700,000 and investments of £140,000, with an assumed net interest gain of 6 per cent. but no other current income, rendered an individual eligible or ineligible for an assisted place. The Minister said that such a person would be eligible. If that person is defined as being poor, there is something wrong with the scheme's definitions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has cited more of the words of wisdom of the hon. Member for Buckingham.

Why are students at independent schools being denied an excellent education? They are being denied the national curriculum, standard assessment task tests and full reporting from Ofsted. I am glad that the Minister of State has returned to his place; on the morning of Friday 9 December 1994, in a debate on education standards, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I submit to the House that the achievement of objectives of standards and quality in education depends on the successful implementation of a number of mechanisms".</p></blockquote>
He then listed them:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those mechanisms are the national curriculum; regular objective assessment and testing; publication of school performance data; regular inspection by independent inspectors…procedures to deal with failing schools".—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 December 1994; Vol. 251, c. 518.]</p></blockquote>
However, the Minister was referring only to schools in the maintained sector. The amendment would ensure that independent and private schools that receive substantial sums of taxpayers' money should offer the same curriculum and accountability as is available in maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amused that later in that debate, in answer to an intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner), the Minister should have said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall shortly see a new, thrusting generation of young Tory Members who will have received the benefit of the curriculum."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 December 1994; Vol. 251, c. 520.]</p></blockquote>
Not if they went to a private independent school—the Minister was wholly wrong on that. The amendment makes it clear that private and independent schools should follow the same sort of accountability as is available to the maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some independent schools have had Ofsted reports. The Under-Secretary, in her usual helpful and kind way, has recently answered several of my questions. We have established that in the past five years, only 14 of the 294 schools in the assisted places scheme have had a full inspection which has been made publicly available. I wonder how the hon. Lady justifies barely three of those schools being inspected a year. I recall that those schools were originally meant to be inspected not on a four-year cycle but once every seven years. One does not need much arithmetic to see that, at three a year, it would take 99 years to inspect those schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be the case if there were 294 such schools, but it seems that the number of schools receiving a subsidy through the assisted places scheme rises day by day. I have before me an answer given by the Under-Secretary of State to my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport on 13 November 1996, in which it is pointed out that 355 schools in England now participate in the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. Some schools have adopted a cavalier approach, and many of them have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>384</span>
embarrassed by the publication of their Ofsted reports. Earlier this year, I asked Ofsted a question about the number of school inspections and, on 27 March, Chris Woodhead replied that just nine independent schools were inspected in 1995–96. That figure includes schools other than those in the assisted places scheme; there are almost 2,300 schools in all. In his reply, he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1996–97 it is anticipated that up to three full inspections will take place".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Up to three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Member for Bath is rightly surprised that up to three—that is, none, one, two or three—inspections only might take place. I should be interested to know how the Under-Secretary justifies the fact that just three such schools will be inspected during the academic year and that many schools do not want the inspection reports to be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote to the Minister of State to ask whether independent schools are obliged to make their Ofsted reports available to parents and, on 17 February 1994, the Minister of State—who has again left the Committee Room—replied, stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any such school which is the subject of a published report is supplied with copies which it can distribute as it sees fit."</p></blockquote>
That should be contrasted with what happens in LEA and other maintained schools, which are obliged by law to inform parents that the report is available and to send them all a copy of the summary of the report, and the parents of pupils at those schools are fully involved with Ofsted inspectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The onus is upon the school to distribute the report to interested parties or to advise them where the report can be obtained."</p></blockquote>
Of course, if a school does not like the report, it can put it on a shelf where it will collect dust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994, the Finborough school wrote to the parents of its pupils about an Ofsted inspection that took place the previous year. That letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we were extremely unhappy about the way it was carried out."</p></blockquote>
Of course, if the report contained bad news and told the truth about it, the school might well have been unhappy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have not obtained copies of the Report…because"—</p></blockquote>
then it listed all the reasons why the school did not make the report available to parents. That is one private school's attitude to its Ofsted report. It did not want parents to see the report because it was unhappy with its contents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps he was not listening when I said that Opposition Members were not opposed to the scheme, but that we wanted better use made of the money to ensure that the schools benefited from it and that the use of that vast amount of money was consistent with the proper auditing of the funds.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are on the subject of taxpayer support, I want to tell the hon. Gentleman that the Duke of York's school is in my constituency. I do not have to hand the exact number of its employees, but my relevant point is that the cost per pupil is about £11,000. That is the cost of an army school for several historic reasons. Is he proposing that a Labour Government would withdraw that £11,000 and make the pupils attend other schools? Would he, therefore, put all the employees who work at the Duke of York's school out of work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Duke of York's school is, indeed, an excellent school. Ofsted's report about it was absolutely glowing. Although it said that the building was a little shabby and needed attention, it said that its academic standards were especially high. The hon. Gentleman must know that that school is not like an ordinary independent or private school, but that it is partly run by the Ministry of Defence.
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
Furthermore, it is not an independent school as such; it is a type of state school. The hon. Gentleman has now given a further example of a superb state boarding school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument was that the Ministery of Defence was not making it clear to all service families that excellent state boarding schools were available for their children. When it sent out the list, it was not clear which were state schools and which were independent schools. The hon. Gentleman made the point excellently for me, and I look forward to his intervening again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a powerful case for why schools that are in receipt of the assisted places scheme money should be subject to the same educational criteria as any other recipient of taxpayers' money. He has been extremely assiduous in eliciting from the Government answers to questions about the assisted places scheme. He will recall his question on 25 November which listed the 14 schools under the assisted places scheme that had published full reports within the past five years. They included such egalitarian institutions as Roedean, Shrewsbury and Westminster school. Does he agree that the first schools that should publish full reports and have inspections are schools such as Dulwich college and the Wisbech grammar school, which are in receipt of more than £1 million each per year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend I would add to that list St. Edward's college and Emanuel school, which receive more than £1 million per year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is now being extended to preparatory schools and the pre-secondary stage of education. I read the advice that was issued by the Government in the document entitled "Assisted Places Scheme: Expansion to Free Standing Preparatory Schools". It refers to the merits that should be considered for preparatory schools joining the scheme and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools are expected to provide a breadth of educational opportunity. Those with fewer than two forms at entry ages seven or eight may be regarded as being unlikely to be able to do so."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, a school with fewer than 60 pupils at two forms of entry in each year may be unsuitable for inclusion in the scheme because it cannot maintain the breadth of education opportunity within it. Those are the conditions for a preparatory school but, as I understand it, the Government believe that five forms at entry are needed in the secondary sector to maintain the breadth of curriculum and the staffing to deliver that curriculum. When the Minister sums up, perhaps she will tell us why the following schools in the assisted places scheme had so few year 11 pupils taking GCSE last year: 39 pupils at Dover college—to which I did not want to return; 27 pupils at Gateways school—less than one form of entry in a secondary school; and just 12 pupils at the Hellenic college of London. The Government are saying that preparatory schools should have at least two forms of entry of 60 pupils—why have secondary schools that do not even meet those criteria for a preparatory school remain in the scheme? I look forward to the Ministers comments on that important matter.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
The final point is on police checks. No member of the Committee would disagree that proper checks should be made on people working in independent schools. The LEA carries out checks with the police on behalf of a maintained school to establish whether a person is unsuited to teaching in a school, but the system for independent schools is, I believe, different in several ways. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that independent schools can go directly to the Department for Education and Employment to check whether someone is a suitable person to be teaching in a school and, importantly, that the independent schools associations also carry such information which they can give to a school. The problem, however, is: who checks whether the school checks with either of those sources? I put it to the Minister that no one does. Perhaps the Minister will advise us on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition want high standards for all children, not just some. In particular, we want schools that are receiving substantial sums of taxpayers' money to have proper financial and curriculum audits. The amendments would ensure that the national curriculum, Ofsted inspections and testing are as available to children on assisted places schemes as they are to children in maintained schools. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I did not attack independent schools but the system that allows schools to be funded without proper auditing. The only way in which an independent school would close under a Labour Government would be if it did not attract sufficient pupils with parents paying privately and it could not maintain its curriculum. We would transfer the money that funds the assisted places scheme to help all children in the early years to have a better education and to be in classes of under 30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, at the moment the hon. Gentleman does not have an overt agenda, but it is always a possibility. [HON. MEMBERS: "Covert."] It is obviously covert.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have plenty of time to speak. He should settle down and just listen for a while. The hon. Member for Devonport did not speak strictly to the amendment. He decided to take us round the houses and began on the issue of auditing the assisted places scheme. He talked about the number of pupils at independent schools under the assisted places scheme, but he does not appreciate that
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
fewer than one in seven pupils have assisted places in the independent sector. At present, no school has more than 50 per cent. of its pupils in the scheme. The hon. Gentleman made a great issue of the cost of the assisted places scheme. The LEA average cost per pupil is £2,900, while assisted places cost £3,700 on average. The hon. Gentleman ignored the fact that the LEA average does not include the overheads and capital costs, which are met separately in the LEA sector. Therefore he was not comparing like with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister responsible for these matters, can the hon. Lady give the average cost for a child in a maintained school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot off the top of my head. But I shall give some accurate figures from another area of the maintained system. The hon. Member for Barking said that it was a scandalous abuse of taxpayers' money that more than £6,000 in some instances was spent on an assisted place. I am willing to give way to allow the hon. Lady to say what a scandalous abuse of taxpayers' money it is that the cost per pupil at Hackney Downs school is £6,489 and that the pupils did not achieve the sort of results achieved by those in assisted places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for giving way. I raised that matter because I knew what her response would be, and I also thought about how I would reply. The Minister is comparing one school that is supposedly in a healthy position—full and running at £6,000 per pupil—with another school that was running down, was eventually closed and whose costs per pupil were disproportionate to its overhead costs. If the Minister really wants to make that absurd comparison, she is not worthy of her position. One cannot compare those two examples. What can be compared are the many private schools for which Ministers consider it appropriate to spend more than £6,000 per pupil and schools in the state sector. In the 11 to 15 group—not the 11 to 18 group to which the Minister referred—£2,600 per pupil is spent, according to her figures. Were we to add the capital costs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the point has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, Mr. O'Hara, I thought that you had forgotten me. I can make the comparisons that I choose to make if the hon. Member for Devonport can choose schools that are not even in the assisted places scheme to support his fallacious arguments. He is right to say that there are 355 schools in the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The funding of Hackney Downs school has been mentioned twice in the Committee—once by the Under-Secretary today and previously by the Minister of State. The record should be put straight. In the last full year of Hackney Downs school, the funding per pupil was £3,370 compared with the average of £2,575 in the Hackney area. The reason why it appeared to be greater in the last few months of the school was because of the number of children who had left, while the residual staff remained
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
for a matter of a few months. The truth is that the school was spending not much more than others in the Hackney area. It was not spending the amount quoted spuriously by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last figure that we have for the average cost per pupil at Hackney Downs is £6,489 and I ask the hon. Gentleman to hold on to the point that he has just made because it will revisit us later in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the earlier intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport. The Minister may have been distracted by the hon. Member for Dover who commented from a sedentary position that if we take away the assisted places scheme from schools, we take away jobs. Does the Minister see the assisted places scheme as a substitute for the independent sector and a job creation scheme to boot, or does she persist with the myth that somehow it creates opportunities for children from deprived backgrounds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows the answer to that question. I see the assisted places scheme as an opportunity for able children from less well-off families to have a good education in a different setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have quite a lot to say because the hon. Member for Devonport has raised a number of points, so I shall get on. In response to a written question from the hon. Member for Devonport, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All 355 schools currently participating in the assisted places scheme in England are conducted for charitable purposes, as required by section 479 of the Education Act 1996. Copies of their accounts are lodged with the Charity Commission and are publicly available."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 November 1996; Vol. 285, c. 281.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Devonport tabled a large number of questions on assisted places, obviously preparing for this debate. He thought that as my officials are always so helpful to Members of the Front Bench, they could help him too, so I know that he is relying on good information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his remarks, the hon. Gentleman gave the impression that there is widespread fraud in the assisted places scheme. I issue a challenge: if he can bring me the names and addresses of the schools and the children and the instances in which he thinks fraud is being perpetrated, we will investigate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no time like the present. Perhaps the hon. Lady can tell the Committee what investigation was undertaken by her Department following the article in 
	<i>The Sunday Times</i> on 12 November 1995. Did her Department investigate John and Frances Freeman, for example, who were quite prepared to tell the newspaper that they had the money, when clearly, their application did not show the sort of income that they had? Has her Department investigated the other cases referred to in the article?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we tried to investigate that case, but as the hon. Gentleman will see, the name of the school was not mentioned; it was not possible to find
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
out the name of the pupil and the school involved. My challenge stands. If the hon. Gentleman can name the pupil, the school and the parents, we will investigate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara. I shall give way now to the hon. Member for Barking—ladies first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister found it so difficult to investigate the allegations that were made not by the Opposition but by 
	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> does not that suggest that there should be another system of auditing, as is suggested in the amendment, to ensure that there is no fraud? Is not she concerned that the Department for Education and Employment cannot properly investigate allegations made in a reputable paper such as 
	<i>The Sunday Times?</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I should make comments about believing everything that is in the press, except that I certainly do not believe everything that I read in the press. If the hon. Lady will let me make progress, I shall take up that point as I work my way through my reply to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take some heart from what the hon. Lady said about taking such allegations seriously. If that is the case, is she aware that I wrote to the Secretary of State immediately after the publication of the article to which my hon. Friend referred, but that I received no reply? If I send the Minister a copy of that letter, will she reply to it, treating the allegations with the seriousness that they deserve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that I am extremely sorry that he has not received a reply. That is most unusual, as he will know from his long dealings with the Department. If the allegations were reported in the papers in 1995, why has he waited until December 1996 to raise this matter? He could have picked up the phone at any time during the past year. Waiting until now is indicative of his interest in such matters.

Schools carry out assessments of parental means on behalf of the Department, but all parents must provide corroborative documentary evidence of their income, such as P60s or tax assessment documentation. The Department monitors the assessments that schools carry out in an annual audit survey. We give regular guidance to schools on good practice in the light of that survey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on that point. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary takes seriously the matter of alleged fraud. As she will know, it might merely be gossip that people are abusing the system. I am grateful to her for beginning to explain the system that the Department operates. Can she clearly tell the Committee what advice the Department gives schools as to how much of a family's capital should be taken into account when deciding whether assistance should be given towards a child's fees? The Under-Secretary has mentioned revenue income, but what about the capital that a family might hold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows the answer to that question. Parents must supply corroborative evidence of their income, but it is difficult to devise a fair way of taking into account capital assets. We already take account of income from assets, as the hon. Lady well knows, and we keep such matters under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 13 November, the hon. Member for Devonport asked me a question on how random audit checks were made, how many such checks uncovered shortcomings and what action was taken against schools where shortcomings were found. I answered that fully in 
	<i>Hansard,</i> so I do not think that he would want me to delay the Committee any longer; it is a matter of public record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the Under-Secretary on this matter. Interestingly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) received no reply from the Department about the allegations made in 
	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> he wrote to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, who replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are complaints about the policy of the scheme rather than its implementation and are therefore outside the Committee's terms of reference."</p></blockquote>
Does not that suggest that the Under-Secretary should look again at the policy? It is the policy, not its implementation, which is opening the system to fraud, but only the implementation of the policy is shown up in random audits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should be careful before making such allegations. I want her to give examples of the fraud that she says is taking place. I have made it clear that the Government would not countenance fraud, but I would need evidence on which to act. We are satisfied that we have put in place good checks and balances in the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the question that I asked on audits. In her answer, she said that the

	<br><blockquote><p>"Department carries out an annual audit survey on a random sample of participating schools to monitor their administration of the scheme."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 November 1996; Vol. 285, c. 282]</p></blockquote>
How many of the schools in the scheme were subjected to an audit, and how many of those audits found what she called "cases with shortcomings"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer off the top of my head, but I undertake to write to him after this sitting and give him the information that is to hand in the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points that were raised on inspection bear little repetition, as I answered the hon. Gentleman's question on Ofsted on 25 November. Ofsted aims to inspect all independent schools over a five to eight-year period. I take issue with him, however, as nearly all the 355 schools in the assisted places scheme have been inspected during the past eight years, and more than 80 per cent. of them have been inspected during the past five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman makes much of the publication of those reports, but it is Ofsted that chooses to publish the full-inspection reports. It examines the different types of provision in independent schools and, from time to time, decides to publish the reports as examples of good practice in the independent sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That really is interesting. We are now being told that all 355 schools have been subject to an Ofsted visit and report, but that only the good reports—14 out of 355—have been made public. I issue a challenge to the Minister: will she now publish the other reports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not up to me to publish the reports. The hon. Gentleman should understand that the schools are independent. It is a matter for Ofsted whether to publish examples of good practice. The fact that it has published only a few reports does not necessarily mean that all the other reports have been bad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Will she also remind us who determined that Ofsted would inspect independent schools? I am sure that the Committee would be interested in the answers to both those simple questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Ofsted inspections are decided on by Ofsted—it decides which schools to visit and which reports should be published.—[

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Courtesy prevents me from suggesting that there is an alternative reason why the Minister did not hear—we shall take it that there was noise from the Committee. I asked her two simple questions. Who decided that Ofsted inspections of state schools should be made public? Who determined that Ofsted would inspect independent schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the answers to the two questions may be found in the Education (Inspectors of Schools in England) Order 1996, and I recommend that the hon. Gentleman reads it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving those clear and perfectly correct answers, as I expected she would. She will confirm that it is perfectly possible, therefore, for the Government to introduce legislation requiring that the reports be made public, as those on state schools must be made public. She cannot, as she seems to be doing, hide behind Ofsted's decision not to have those reports published. If she accepted the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Devonport she would have what she appears to want, but unfortunately believes cannot happen because Ofsted will not allow it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the slightest. The hon. Gentleman fails to grasp the fact that the schools are independent. I know that his party, like all Labour Members, dislike the fact that there is free enterprise and spirit in the education world, but independent schools and, in particular, APS schools within the independent sector have been framed to take account of that ethos. Independent schools are good examples of high standards which help create a climate of excellence and we are firmly committed to their existence—unlike the Opposition, as demonstrated by the noises coming from their Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree that there is cause for concern on that issue? In 1984, when the assisted places scheme was introduced, 92.4 per cent. of the pupils in the scheme got five GCSEs at grades A to C; in 1996, only 87 per cent. of APS pupils in the 62 schools that entered the scheme that year got five GCSEs at grades A to C—a drop of 5 per cent. Is not that a significant factor which should affect where we place public money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the time has come for me to bandy statistics with the hon. Lady. Perhaps she should look at the school examination results for 1996 which show that 91.6 per cent. of APS pupils gained five GCSEs at grades A to C, compared with 44.5 per cent. of pupils in all schools and 41.7 per cent. of pupils in maintained schools. In the summer of 1995, APS pupils had a 94 per cent. GCSE pass rate at grades A to C and a 94 per cent. A-level pass rate at grades A to E. The early returns from the 1996 survey indicate that that performance has been maintained. Assisted places are good value for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I take the Minister back to a comment that she made prior to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Barking? Does the Minister regard the need for accountability of public funds spent in private schools as responsibly as I presume she regards public funds spent in the state sector? In many debates in the House of Commons, she and her colleagues have described the mechanisms that they have introduced to attempt to ensure accountability of public funds in the public sector. It seems strange to Opposition Members that that determination to hold accountable people who receive public funds does not extend to expenditure in the private sector. Will the Minister tell the Committee what mechanisms of accountability her Department has put in place in regard to the expenditure of public funds in the private sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in danger of repeating myself, but I believe that the mechanisms that we have already put in place as checks and balances are sufficient. Schools' claims for fee remission are audited by independent auditors and the Department also carries out an annual audit survey on a random sample basis. If the hon. Lady can show me examples of fraud or misuse of the taxpayers' money, we shall investigate them. I cannot be fairer than that. There is a fundamental difference of opinion between the Opposition parties and my party; the Opposition would abolish the assisted places scheme and do anything they could to undermine the independent school sector, whereas we are firmly committed to both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is on the provisions in the amendments to part V of the Police Bill, which seeks to widen access to full criminal record checks for more sensitive areas of employment, which includes tightening the existing arrangements to allow checks to be performed on staff even where their access to vulnerable people such as children is minimal. I hope that the hon. Member for Devonport will be comforted by my saying that independent schools will be able to gain access to the service. They are already restricted from employing teachers and other staff who appear on list 99.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. Is any check made to ensure that independent schools always check list 99 or is it something that they are supposed to do, but which they may or may not carry out? The hon. Lady will appreciate my difficulty; the LEA is obliged to carry out such a check and it does so on behalf of the LEA school, but who ensures that such checks are made in the independent sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of who checks the checkers is always difficult. Who checks the LEAs? Independent schools are strongly advised to conduct criminal background checks on staff who have substantial access to children. When seeking registration with the Department, all independent schools are provided with relevant information on how to conduct such checks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady posed the question, "Who checks the LEAs?" As she is fully aware, we shall be dealing later in the Bill with a proposal that originated from the Opposition that LEAs will be subject to Ofsted inspections. LEAs will, indeed, be checked and we shall be supporting the broad thrust of that part of the Bill. It is a non sequitur to say that because the LEAs are not currently checked—with cross-party support, they obviously will be—we can avoid the conclusion of my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport that checks should be made to ensure that vetting is taking place. We also want the schools to be invigilated so that there is not a repeat of similar stories of scandals in certain independent schools that were reported by 
	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> whereby people who would certainly be on list 99 could gain employment in those schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I take the matter extremely seriously, but I believe that the advice given by the Department to what are, after all, independent institutions is couched in the strongest possible terms. It is important that all independent schools know how to carry out the checks. If there is something amiss with a school, the Department has the final sanction to remove the registration of that school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that local education authorities are under a statutory obligation to carry out the check. The independent sector is not under a statutory obligation. It is not a matter of who checks the checkers; it is that one group has a statutory obligation to undertake checks and the other does not. To protect children, it makes common sense to have a statutory obligation in the independent sector, as it does in the maintained sector. The matter is as simple as that, and I should have thought that the Minister could concede that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Placing the requirements on independent schools as specified in the amendment would amount to a restriction that was inconsistent with its status as an independent institution. [HON. MEMBERS: "The safety of children."] I do not, for one minute, diminish the need for the safety of all children, but the institutions are independent and I consider that the advice and instructions that come from the Department fully cover the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is clearly about to finish her speech. That would be a pity because I should like her to deal with an issue that was raised eloquently by the hon. Member for Devonport. Why is not a condition placed on those independent schools that are in receipt of APS money to require them to deliver the national curriculum, testing, and so on? If the hon. Lady is not willing to address that more general point, I want to ask her about one specific point about the nature of the curriculum.

The Minister will recall that she chided me from the Dispatch Box on the Floor of the House about a misquotation in a newspaper of my views on religious education. She will recall that I made the position extremely clear. I said that I believe strongly in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
importance of religious education. Will she explain why there is no requirement on independent schools participating in the assisted places scheme to deliver religious education? Does the hon. Lady not believe that the subject is important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillian</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that it is because they are independent schools. Much as the hon. Gentleman would like to ensure that all schools conform to a single pattern and that all children are educated in the maintained sector, it is not the Government's view. But I will take up the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The APS schools are not statutorily obliged to implement the national curriculum. Many have implemented it in total and most keep to it closely. They have indicated their support for its aim of raising standards. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to revisit the ground so excellently covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport; he and those who intervened in his speech made some extremely valuable points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would put on a level footing the conduct of schools in what the Under-Secretary refers to as the independent sector and that of schools in the maintained sector. Of course, those schools are not truly independent, which is the heart of the contradiction in the Government's position. They say that because those schools are "independent" they need next to no regulation, even in such matters as the welfare of children—a matter covered by paragraph (d) of amendment No. 170, which I should have thought was close to the heart of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another contradiction. With the assisted places scheme, the Government want to be seen to show benevolence to children from under-privileged backgrounds. The reality, as the hon. Member for Dover said so injudiciously from a sedentary position, is that that money is a subsidy to the independent school sector and allows an infusion of fresh academic ability into those schools. Without that infusion, those schools would not have reached the level of competence revealed by their examination results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inconceivable that we should spend so much money on relatively few children, yet not place the same requirements on the independent schools that we expect from others. Ministers consistently say that local education authorities, schools and their governing bodies should be accountable—that anyone who receives even 1 p has to be accountable. Yet hundreds of thousands of people, from the very same background, are now being held accountable in the most unfortunate way under the jobseeker's allowance. The Government can hand over in excess of £1 million per school, yet simple requirements that obtain everywhere else do not obtain in those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inconceivable that the Government should be possessed of an ideological fervour in trying to undermine maintained education and enhance the position of other schools when, as the hon. Member for Dover acknowledged, those other schools will undoubtedly collapse without a free, unfettered
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
market to provide people to fill the places. It is equally remarkable that we have a Minister of State who is one of the champions of deregulation. Why not deregulate what is happening in those other schools in a truly deregulatory manner and ensure that they do not get a subsidy that they do not deserve and do not warrant in educational terms? Without that subsidy, as the Member for Dover is about to tell us, many of those 355 schools—I hope not Dover college because, as has been said, it is an excellent school—that presently receive subsidy would go under.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used the word "collapse". If the withdrawal of the money caused schools to collapse, the Labour party's proposals would cause a lot of schools to collapse, a lot of schools to close and a lot of jobs to be lost in the independent sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are trying to point out is the illogicality of the Government's position in terms of providing a subsidy that would be condemned anywhere else, in any other part of our national life. The short answer is that we do not want to see any good school collapse, but obviously the commitment of the Labour party has to be towards the maintained sector and the 94 per cent. of our children who are in that particular sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we object to most strongly is a rather facile argument that, by subsidising those schools, one is doing a justice to the vast majority of children, when actually they are losing out. That is why we have set out that what we would do in Government, with money from the assisted places scheme, would be to enable all of our children to be advantaged by transferring that allocation of resources to stage one, to reduce class size.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should a Labour Government come into power, would the hon. Gentleman remove the assisted places scheme within the first year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of being repetitious, let me make it absolutely clear: what we shall not do is to approve any more places. We are not going to take away any child's education. We have made that point absolutely clear. In fact, I must say to Conservative Members that when I addressed the annual conference of independent schools at Warwick university earlier this year, there was no dissent from the schools themselves; they understood perfectly what we were about and why we were about to do it. There were no views that the whole of their system was about to collapse because the unwarranted subsidy was being withdrawn, particularly when the undertakings were repeated that it would not be a case of suddenly taking away the funding from individual children, but that it would be done incrementally by not approving any more fresh assisted places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now says that he will support the scheme for at least 10 or 11 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, what we are saying is what we have always said. The reason why we are opposing clause 19 is that it is an unwarranted extension to an unfair scheme to which we are wholly opposed. If the Government want to put fresh money into this particular area, that suits us right down to the ground because we can use it when a Labour Government take over. However, we are rather upset at the £56 million that they have taken away from the £186 million that was promised for nursery education. Nevertheless, these things have a habit of balancing out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to put across a point of principle: it is absolutely unacceptable that the Government should hide behind this nonsense that, somehow, some children are being advantaged. In actual fact, it could be argued that they are being disadvantaged. We could argue that those children who have been given places on the assisted places scheme are actually suffering a disadvantage because the safeguards that apply in the maintained sector do not apply to them. I would be very wary of sending a child of mine to a school under the assisted places scheme if the safeguards, particularly those under the Police Bill, do not apply to children in the independent sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that he will not withdraw the support from any individual child currently going through the assisted places scheme. That means that there will be a decrease in payments for up to the next seven or eight years. Therefore, could he tell us where the money will come from in year 1 for the initiative on class sizes? Is he making a fresh spending commitment on behalf of the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made that point absolutely clear and, despite the inflated figures that have come from the Government, we are far happier to accept the projections that were drawn up for us by the National Foundation for Educational Research, with the potential therein for reducing class size. I thought for one moment that the hon. Gentleman was going to stand up and try to excuse the way in which class sizes have actually increased in recent years. That is further evidence of the way in which the Government have misdirected resources to where it is least needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I wanted to say that, in Wales, the funding of a place under the assisted places scheme costs two thirds more than that of a place in a local education authority secondary school.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not like to speculate on what the Government ought to aspire to—not a great deal, I hasten to add, for maintained schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Devonport has been extremely eloquent in his argument about value for money. He made it abundantly clear that value for money is not a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
criterion for the assisted places scheme, which was never designed to provide value for money. It was designed as a subsidy for those schools whose doctrinaire line accorded with that of the Government of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not answered my question. He said that he would make a saving on a sliding scale over seven years. Can he tell us the precise figure that will be saved in year 1 and the precise sum that will be put into reducing class sizes? The Labour party has pledged to cut class sizes to 30 or under for five, six and seven-year-olds by using money saved from the assisted places scheme. How much money will the Opposition save in year 1, how much money will they put into the pledge in year 1, what is the difference, where will that money come from, is it a new commitment and has the hon. Gentleman cleared it with the shadow Chancellor?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stray too far and incur your wrath, Mr. O'Hara. Suffice it to say: no, there is no new pledge; no, we are not making a new spending commitment; yes, we remain committed to transferring resources from the assisted places scheme to reduce class sizes. We are so confident of that, it is one of our five early pledges—pledges that we have the confidence to lay before the British electorate long before we get to the formal manifesto stage. Our pledges are unlike those that were made on a whole variety of issues, including taxation, before the 1992 election—you will recall those, Mr. O'Hara.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Phasing out the assisted places scheme by stopping new intakes but letting pupils already in the scheme continue, as the Opposition currently propose, will save less than £5 million in the first academic year. That would pay for 200 extra primary teachers—about one for every 90 primary schools. Could the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we have to make our point ad eternam during the debate. We have made it repeatedly on the Floor of the House and, if the hon. Lady wants, I will refer to her and her colleagues a copy of the National Foundation for Education Research's costings and report on exactly how that point will be achieved. The intention is clear, as are the source of the funding and the destination of the funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is rather odd that Ministers are getting cosseted? Costings of proposals put forward by the Labour party have been provided to them by, one presumes, civil servants. Secondly, I know that we are not supposed to be arithmetic geniuses on the Committee, but the idea that phasing out spending of more than £100 million for seven years of children's education
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
would yield savings of only £5 million in year 1 takes a lot of believing. Does that not place a question mark over the advice given by ministerial advisers or, indeed, by Ministers themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Should we not be grateful to the Minister for providing figures, as the Labour party is unable to cost its promises?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The numeracy problems of hon. Members on the Government Front Bench, as evidenced by the figures that we were given for black Wednesday—and, before that, during the last general election—are stark evidence of the conclusions of a recent international study, which showed that we had a long way to go with the teaching of maths. One thing is sure: the required advance in educational achievement—in maths, literacy or a whole heap of areas—will not be met by a Government who prefer to take an ideological rather than an educational stance on the dispersal of funds. That is the hub of my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are an honest attempt to persuade the Government to consider the huge amounts of money that are going to these schools, and to think about value for money. The standards that should be maintained are those that should be encouraged by virture of adherence to the national curriculum. The results of the money that is being spent on those places should be assessed by publicly reported test results. That money should be effectively monitored by Ofsted inspections because it is a matter of great public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the interest, safety and well-being of our children who attend those schools should be safeguarded in the same way as the interests of children in maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to make a contribution during this part of the debate, so I shall be brief. This morning, we considered a whole range of amendments as a result of allegations about intimidation in ballots in grant-maintained schools. We approved of and tried to strengthen that measure. But what annoys the Opposition is that the Government offer swift and decisive action when there are allegations of abuse in ballots in grant-maintained schools, yet when there are allegations of serious misuse of public money in the assisted places scheme, the Government ask us to provide them with the evidence. The Government's only evidence of abuse in the grant-maintained sector are two ballots that had to be re-run and, on the basis of that, they have introduced new legislation. Numerous allegations have been made about the misuse of public funds in the assisted places scheme, but no action has been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That favouring approach towards one sector rather than another annoys the Opposition. Our concern about the misuse of public funds is real. Too much is being written and said by those involved for the Government not to take it seriously. By refusing to take it seriously, the Government give the impression, whether they mean to or not, that they are prepared to

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Lady one more time to bring me tangible evidence of fraud so that it can be investigated.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must realise that it is her Department's responsibility to look for the evidence. We are the Opposition; the Minister has the civil servants and the means to look into that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comparison that I wish to draw is that, according to the Department's figures, there were two instances of irregularities in ballots in grant-maintained schools, and action has been taken—we discussed the relevant amendments this morning—but when many allegations are made, no action is taken to ensure that fraud does not take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must appreciate that it is the Opposition who have made those allegations.

It is very serious if the Opposition are not prepared to substantiate their allegations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have repeated allegations made by those involved in the assisted places scheme—parents and students. It is almost unbelievable that the Minister should be unable to pursue the allegation that was made in 
	<i>The Sunday Times</i> when names were given. That apparently is her point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady not understand that she is indulging in synthetic indignation if she cannot produce names? She is not interested in trying to find out whether the allegations are true or not. Her argument has been destroyed because she refuses to name one person, one school or one parent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The allegations were made in the article in 
	<i>The Sunday Times.</i> The Minister said that in spite of having the name of the pupil who made the allegations, she did not follow them up. Too much is being said by heads, parents and accountants who operate the assisted places scheme for proper investigations to be made. I did not intend to reopen the debate. My point was that, following two proven instances of trouble with ballots in the grant-maintained sector, a whole new raft of legislation is being introduced. But despite a number of serious complaints about the working of the assisted places scheme, they are not prepared to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two other points are crucial to the debate. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam gave the game away. It is deplorable that after 17 years of Tory
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
Government, Tory Members do not believe that the state system of education, for which they have been responsible for a generation, is good enough to educate our most able children. The hon. Lady said that our most able children must be given opportunity in the private sector. Despite the fact that our state schools have been run by the Government for 17 years, I believe that they are good schools that can raise standards and offer opportunity to all children no matter what their ability. Opposition Members have faith and belief in the state sector to do its best and to deliver the highest standards for able children. It is a shame that the Government who purport to be running the state system and are accountable for it do not share that faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an appalling absurdity. We have excellent schools in the state sector. I send my three children to state shools and they are doing exceptionally well. Our debate is about widening yet further—as the Government have already done—the variety and opportunites available to all our children. That is not mutually exclusive with the fact that we have excellent schools in Kent to which I send my children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister did not deliberately misunderstand. I said that I was referring to a comment made earlier by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam when she implied that state schools were second best because our most able children have to be sent to schools in the private sector. We believe that the state system can deliver the highest standards and opportunities for all children, no matter what their ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that the Minister must be clear in her mind on the definition of an independent school. I understood that an independent school was independent of the state and did not rely on the state for a significant part of its funds. I do not accept the argument, but it is a logical one, which I understand, that if a school stands independent of the state and provides its own money, it may have the right to operate by its own rules. I am not happy with that, but I accept the logicality of the argument. But when a school takes from the public purse up to £1 million each year, it ceases to be an independent school because it is not independent of the state. The hon. Member for Dover made it clear in a number of interventions today that, without the money from the assisted places scheme, some independent schools may be under threat. Some independent schools are highly dependent on the money from the assisted places scheme and the consequence of that must be to lose some of their independence. By taking state money, they encroach on the state system and the mechanisms of accountability, with the rules that apply thereto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may want to suggest a hybrid system, with schools that are state schools, funded from the state purse and run by the state rules, and schools that are wholly independent of the state, which take not a penny from the state and are run by their own rules. The Government have created a new sector of school: it is not independent and it may not be state, but it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
takes significant money from the public purse. The Minister should consider what new rules should apply to that kind of hybrid school. Her speech today contained no suggestion that she has even addressed that issue. All that she has repeated—quite honestly, we are fed up with hearing it because it is illogical—is that those schools are independent. They are not. They are schools that rely for their existence on a large sum of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to take public funds should have a consequence in terms of public accountability. Nothing that the Minister has said today gives us any reason to believe that she understands that, with the assisted places scheme, her Government have created a hybrid scheme that needs new rules and new accountability. Those schools are not independent schools. I invite the Minister to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I be the judge of what I said, and not the hon. Member for Gravesham? It is a matter of record that some independent schools rely for their existence to a large extent on public funds. The hon. Member for Dover intervened twice to tell the Committee that there was a danger that, without the assisted places schemes, jobs would be lost and schools might be closed. I merely repeated those comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not mean my contribution to be a long one, Mr. O'Hara, and so I shall bring my comments to a close. We are talking not about the future of the independent sector but about public accountability for money that is given to independent schools—which makes them no longer independent. There must be a consequence of receiving public money: that is part of the deal in this society. If one receives public money, there is another side to the equation and a consequence in terms of accountability. As my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport said, those schools have taken the state's money and they must therefore be held accountable in the same way that the maintained sector is held accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a wrecking amendment and it does not seek to end the assisted places scheme. The amendment would allow the assisted places scheme to continue, and money would continue to pour into it. However, the amendment contains several mechanisms to hold the independent sector, which chose to accept public funds, accountable to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sensible amendment. The Minister's failure to give a definition of independent schools is absolutely staggering. The amendment would ensure that there is public accountability where there is public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>The Sunday Times</i> and the allegations reported therein. Other allegations have been advanced by reputable poeple. The master of Haileybury in Hertfordshire, David Jewell,

	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
estimated—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the Minister is concerned about the proper protection of public money, she should listen to what he said. He estimated that 20 per cent. of applications for assisted places—or one in five—were incorrect. Neil Gamble, who is the head of Exeter school in Devon—which is not far from the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport—said that there was a 10 per cent. level of fraud. Articles in 
	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> the evidence of head teachers whom I have quoted and the research of various academics show that those who know fear that fraud may be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the job of Opposition Members to find instances of fraud; it is our job to draw the Government's attention to the fact that professionals within the system allege that fraud exists. It is the Government's job to ensure that there is a system in place that ensures that fraud does not occur. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee said that it is the system that is wrong, which is why that Committee could not investigate the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government are not carrying out their duty to satisfy themselves that no fault exists. If they continue to ignore the allegations of abuse in the system, they will not be acting in a proper manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the second series of issues that were raised because I do not believe that the Minister understood them properly. One of our concerns is whether we get value for money for the more than £100 million that is invested in private schools. The Minister's answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), the shadow Secretary of State for Education, was that between 1991–92 and 1994–95—a period of more than four years—public expenditure on the assisted places scheme increased by a third from just over £75 million to just over £100 million. At the same time, the number of pupils helped through the assisted places scheme increased by only 8 per cent.—that is a back-of-the-envelope calculation and no doubt someone will correct me if I am wrong—from 27,641 to 29,747.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
During that five-year period, the cost increased by a third, but the number of places increased by only 8 per cent.—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Two debates are going on in the Committee. I am tolerant only of one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government propose to extend the system to preparatory schools. I came across something the other day that suggested to me that our amendments are extremely important. Gospel Oak primary school in Camden was found to be failing, first, by the Inner London education authority in its final days and, secondly, by Ofsted. As a result of that, the head teacher left the school at a massive expense—about £300,000—to the public purse given his conditions of service. He than bought a preparatory school in Hendon or Barnet—the hon. Member for Hendon, South is again absent, but he will no doubt know that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That head teacher, who was found to be failing in the state sector, went off and purchased a preparatory school in the private sector which will now be eligible for assisted places under provisions in the clause. Without the checks proposed in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport, children will go to that school where the quality of education will no doubt fail in the same way that it did when that person was head of a primary school in Camden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No Opposition Member would deny our children the privilege of state education. The problem with Conservative Members is that they believe, as was said by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, that private schools are somehow superior to state schools. For that reason, they have no right to oversee our education system as they have done for 17 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hardly thought two hours ago that I would excite such a lively debate as we have had. Because we have had such a full debate, I will keep my remarks brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you rightly pointed out, Mr. O'Hara, this is an important debate, not just because of the principles involved, which differ from one side of the Committee to the other, but because of the issue of accountability of substantial sums of taxpayers' money and in terms of the care and welfare of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up on a couple of points made by the Minister. First, I shall take her last point about police checks being made on teachers. As I understand it, there is a statutory obligation on LEAs to make a check with list 99 to see whether teachers are listed and whether they should be allowed to be employed by the authority and the school. The Minister then said that independent schools were only strongly advised to make such a check. If she is telling us that an independent school does not have a statutory obligation to make those checks, she is potentially putting children at risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the statement made by the Minister about giving advice to independent schools must send a chill down the backbone of any parent because of the possible implications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. If a school is deregulated and proper checks are not made, that will affect the confidence that parents have in the establishment. The Minister is doing a disservice to independent and private schools by not supporting our important amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to what happens when there is total deregulation. She should carefully check the records of what happened in the late 1980s at the Crookham Court school. I accept that the event occurred before the Children Act 1989—in fact, I think that the findings at Crookham Court school led to the introduction of certain parts of that Act. In that case, deregulation was running rampant. There were no checks on the teachers being employed and paedophiles were subsequently imprisoned. I remind the Minister that the school was almost wholly supported by taxpayers' money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot comment on the Crookham Court school, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman understood that I take such matters extremely seriously. I want to clarify something, as I am not sure that he understood what I said or what the provisions are. There is a statutory requirement on independent and maintained schools in relation to the list 99 provision. But there is no statutory requirement either on LEAs or on independent schools to make the criminal checks, although both are strongly advised to do so. There is parity and equality in the circumstances pertaining to independent schools and LEAs. There is no difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that matter. In fact, if she checks in 
	<i>Hansard,</i> later, she will find that I said that independent schools and LEAs were similar in that the same obligations existed for both. The Minister introduced the doubt by using the phrase "strongly advised". I am glad for her reassurance, but the point remains: who will ensure that independent schools are making those checks on list 99? The Minister has still not answered that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members said that I was attacking the independent school system. I was not. I was attacking the system that allows funds from the taxpayer to be used without any proper financial or academic auditing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Points have been eloquently made in the debate. I will not attempt to sum all those points or respond to the matters raised by the Minister. However, this matter is of such grave importance that I want to push the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 167, in page 17, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) In subsection (4) of that section at the end there shall be added the words "and to the availability of places in grant-maintained schools and schools maintained by local education authorities".'</p></blockquote>
This debate will not be as wide ranging as the previous one. It concerns section 479(4) of the Education Act 1996, which specifies that before a participation agreement is made to enable an independent school to take part in the assisted places scheme,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of securing an equitable distribution of assisted places … between boys and girls."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment, which is a probing amendment seeking information from the Government, is to add a requirement for a participation agreement to have regard to the availability of places in grant-maintained and local education authority maintained schools before an independent school can take part in such an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the assisted places scheme is restricted to secondary schools. Clause 19 will strip away that limitation and allow primary schools—preparatory schools in the jargon of the independent sector—to participate in the assisted places scheme. The Government announced their intention to double the number of available places, but could do that only by introducing a whole new sector of schools. The plain truth is that the assisted places scheme has never been oversubscribed. Each year, 136 places are on offer in Wales, but they have never all been taken up, although we managed to fall five short one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that I have tabled the amendment, which has a specific concern. Far more places are available in England, and I would be interested in their geographic distribution. The Government intend to double the number of places, which are intended for the secondary sector, although a child of preparatory school age can benefit from the assisted places scheme if he is accelerated through the system because of his ability and takes up a secondary place. Before the Government make new participation agreements or confirm agreements, however, they should have regard to the number of places that are already available in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
the maintained sector in a school's locality. In some areas, a problem could arise with surplus places because of the number of applications that are made under the assisted places scheme. Because there are more so-called independent schools in some areas, the snatching of money from schools in the maintained sector—whether grant maintained or local authority maintained—by children who go into the enlarged assisted places scheme could lead to surplus places in that sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is intended to discover whether the Government have considered the issue and whether they can ascertain, on the basis of information that is available to them, whether such problems will arise. The matter is clearly of concern and I hope that the Government can tell us how great the danger is. It is possible that schools in the maintained sector could end up with empty places, which would increase their unit costs. The Government would be taking money out of the maintained sector and giving up to two thirds additional money for the child to go into the independent sector. That could increase maintained schools' unit costs in some areas and create many knock-on problems for the organisation of education. Do the Government think that that could be a problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to restrict the Secretary of State's discretion over the allocation of assisted places. The Secretary of State is already required to have regard to the desirability of securing an equitable distribution of places throughout the country and between boys and girls, as the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) acknowledged. Those are proper considerations in the allocation of places. The amendment would place an additional requirement on the Secretary of State: consideration of the availability of maintained schools places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the amendment is to limit the availability of assisted places where there is surplus capacity in the state sector. It would restrict the Secretary of State's discretion on the allocation of places and, in turn, restrict parental choice. Parents should be able to choose the education that they want for their children, not be forced to accept what others think best for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the statutory requirements, schools applying for admission to the scheme must satisfy stringent criteria relating to the breadth and balance of their curriculum, the academic achievements of their pupils and the quality of their teaching staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question not of restricting choice for parents, but of making an assessment of cost to the taxpayer. If the Government spend two thirds more on an assisted places place and, at the same time, push up the unit costs in the maintained sector in some areas, there will be inefficiencies for the taxpayer, who will pay through the nose twice over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the premise that such places will cost two thirds more is incorrect. Secondly, using the same argument, is the hon. Gentleman saying that assisted places are wrong for areas in which there are parents who choose to send their children abroad to
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
school or for areas in which there are parents who can afford to pay the full costs of sending their children to an independent school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman says that he does not agree with that—therefore, he thinks that parents should have the choice of sending their children to independent schools if they can afford it, or of sending their children abroad. Their choice should not be restricted and, therefore, the choice of assisted places should also not be restricted. Children in one area should not be punished simply because an LEA has not managed its surplus places correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information about the educational opportunities available, the intake policy of schools, parental demand and financial viability are also taken into account. Those are proper considerations when deciding whether to admit a school to the scheme. The availability of places in the maintained sector is not directly relevant. The amendment is a further example of the Opposition's preference for uniformity of provision and is to the detriment of the exercising of parental choice. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather surprised at the interpretation put on the amendment by the Minister. I was trying to find out whether there are some areas in which the scheme could be a problem because there are financial implications. It would not be beyond the wit of a local education authority to examine the distribution of places in its schools and make decisions about that, but those matters cannot be dealt with quickly. There is no question of restricting choice—the Bill will restrict parental choice much more than would this little amendment, because extending selection restricts choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should have the power to say that more participation agreements cannot be introduced—perhaps only one LEA would be affected—because problems will be created. It may never happen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense. At least 2,000 pupils currently on the assisted places scheme are boarders. There boarding costs are paid for by bursaries and scholarships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister thinks that, because only one or two areas may be affected. To give her the chance to consider the distribution of assisted places, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 17, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) In subsection (5) of that section—

	<ol>

	<li>in paragraph (a), the word "and" shall be omitted; and</li>

	<li>at the end, there shall be added the words "and</li>

	<li>shall require priority for the remission of fees to be given to pupils who have not previously attended an independent school".'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
It is a relatively simple amendment, but it would have serious ramifications. It would give priority for the remission of fees to pupils who have not previously attended independent schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is aimed at countering two disturbing trends in the assisted places scheme and the changes to it that are proposed in the Bill. First, the Government have proposed changes to the factors that should be taken into account by the Secretary of State in selecting schools, especially preparatory schools, for membership of the expanded scheme. We have several concerns about that which could be raised in the context of amendment No. 168, among others, and I hope that we will touch on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the new factors, to which I have referred, is that preparatory schools should arrange links with senior schools to offer continuity in the assisted places scheme. One result of that, of course would be to encourage parents who want an assisted secondary place to go for an assisted primary place, simply to guarantee the position on secondary transfer. We contend that the measure provides an artificial inducement to move into the independent sector early in order to fill the assisted places to which the Government are committed and to which those primary schools have access. Our amendment would counter that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would help to address the additionality issue by making it more difficult for parents who were paying for an independent place anyway, or whose families were paying—grandparents, or rich uncles or aunties, for example—to get an unnecessary subsidy. I shall not repeat our arguments, which we have gone into at length, the income should not be the sole arbiter in determining how somebody can access an assisted place. Capital is certainly not taken into account—my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport went to great lengths to point out particular, well-publicised instances of people who had in excess of £100,000 a year of unearned income and properties worth in excess of £700,000 but who were apparently able to profit from the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would place a further restriction on schools' freedom over the allocation of places. It would require a school always to give priority to a maintained-sector applicant, even over a better qualified independent-sector applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it absolutely clear that the assisted places scheme is not a means of supporting those who have sent their children to independent schools anyway. It is a means of opening up independent schooling to children who otherwise would never have dreamed of getting there. It is evidence of the success of the scheme that nearly 70 per cent. of assisted pupils come from maintained primary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A balance must be struck between schools' discretion over the selection of pupils and the conditions that the Government attach to the exercise of that discretion. The present arrangements strike that appropriate balance. The scheme supports those
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
whom it is intended to help, and have the scope to take account of the individual circumstances of applicants for places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would entail undue fettering of schools' freedom over pupil selection and could result in the most deserving candidate not receiving an assisted place. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of rehearsing the same arguments. That was no answer whatever to the points that have been raised not only in Committee—particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport but each year when the statutory instrument is brought before the House so that it can consider the assisted places scheme. Who benefits from the scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members do not accept that the scheme is a magnanimous gesture by the Government to help children from under-privileged or deprived backgrounds to access places in independent sch000ls. the origins of the scheme go back to an overt attempt to subsidise those schools—formerly direct grant schools—that went into the independent sector for purely ideological reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that while some children from low-income families take up assisted places, the majority of places are taken up by reasonably well-off people whose parents often already have degrees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. My old school, St. Edward's college was named as one of the prime recipients of funds under the assisted places scheme. It is a fine school and I know that many youngsters who attend it are from the very background that the Government intend. However, that does not provide a complete picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is ample evidence, as my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport has shown, that some people are abusing the scheme. The amendments are intended—one of two main objectives—to prevent further abuse by ensuring that provisions are not used as a back-door means of avoiding paying for private education which would otherwise have to be paid for. Many people who already pay fees are seeking a subsidy in place of fees that they can well afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was only one part of the argument: I spoke of two reasons—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->

sector are selected on the basis of an academic test. It is not a test of their potential but of their academic achievement. Such testing could rule out many children with great potential achievement who, for various reasons, had not so far achieved enough in their schools. My hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given a great deal of thought to the way in which schools choose to cream off pupils from the maintained sector. It affects not only individual pupils but the reputation of individual schools for academic achievement. I wonder whether some of the figures cited earlier would have been so impressive if they had not had the benefit of recruiting some pupils on the basis of academic tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are less concerned about the principle of assisting through the general run of funding those from a deprived background to gain
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one important point that should be put on record as we debate the amendment. We have some serious objections about the assisted places scheme.
