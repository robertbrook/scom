	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stuart Bell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Middlesbrough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committe has considered the Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 602).</p></blockquote>
This is the first Committee that I have attended that you have chaired, Mrs. Winterton. I am grateful for that and I look forward to attending more Committees chaired by you. I assure you that we shall not incur your wrath by straying beyond the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise three issues. The first is the amendment to delete the provisions setting out the remuneration of shorthand writers appointed in insolvency proceedings. I am a former shorthand writer and I still write shorthand. I take a great interest in 
	<i>Hansard</i> staff and wish always to protect them—I once appointed myself unofficial shop steward. Can we be sure that the change will not make it less likely that shorthand writers in insolvency proceedings will be better remunerated? Does it mean that they will somehow not be accommodated under the insolvency rule 7.17? I sat through 117 days of the child abuse inquiry in Cleveland and saw the work done, day in, day out, by the shorthand writers there. It would be helpful for the Minister to assure me that their interests will not be neglected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is about the definition of obligations that are not provable as debts in a bankruptcy. After the many major bankruptcies of the 1980s, it is important to ensure that those with entitlements under the bankruptcy laws will not be short-changed under the new definition of obligation. We can write our life stories on such orders and statutory instruments; I was a member of the Committee considering the Children Act 1989 and helped to change the law of the land in relation to children and families. That Act redefined family proceedings. Thirdly, the Child Support Act 1991 introduced maintenance assessment. Will the Minister clarify what the changes mean, how they relate to children and what effect they will have on maintenance possibly being unpaid by the fathers? What is the real significance of that amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Corporate Affairs (Mr. Neil Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, of course, echo the outrageous flattery of the hon. Member for Middlesbrough (Mr. Bell). I, too, look forward to serving under you Mrs. Winterton, on many occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the statutory instrument is to make minor amendments to the Insolvency Rules 1986. Those rules set out detailed procedures for the conduct of insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instrument deals with two unrelated matters. First, it deletes the provisions setting out the rates of remuneration of shorthand writers appointed in insolvency
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
proceedings. The purpose is to remove the need for constant updating of the rates, thereby allowing the current fees to be charged. Under the amended rules, any question arising about the rates to be paid can be determined by the court in its discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot guarantee what rates will be paid in future, as I shall have no control over them. Hitherto, the rates have been increased every year, which has necessitated frequent amendments being made to schedule 3. Those changes have often been made in arrears, the consequence of which has been that the charges could not fully be recovered from the estates. The change should have no impact whatever on the rates of pay that shorthand writers receive—or, at least, it is not likely to disadvantage them, which I think is what the hon. Gentleman wanted to know. I have no reason to believe that will be so. The change allows us to be more flexible and allows the courts to have a discretionary power to examine the situation, so there ought to be a greater connection between the charges levied and the commercial reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue addressed in the rules is the types of claim that are not provable in a bankruptcy. The rules simply reflect changes made in the Insolvency Act 1986 by the Children Act 1989 and by the Child Support Act 1991. I know that the hon. Member for Middlesbrough is an expert on the Children Act 1989 and that he has turned his parliamentary activities to good account by writing a book—the standard work, no doubt—about the Act. The rules preserve and perpetuate rights to prove such claims outside the bankruptcy, so that when the bankrupt becomes discharged, those debts do not expire and can be pursued. That protects those given rights under the Children Act 1989 and the Child Support Act 1991. The redefinition that the hon. Gentleman asked me about has been drafted to include domestic proceedings and maintenance assessments made under those two Acts. The purpose of the changes in the rules is purely to carry forward the changes already made in the primary legislation into secondary legislation, so they are a protection of individuals' rights rather than a threat to them. That is all that I can say about the hon. Gentleman's questions and the measure. If he wants to come back, I shall do my best to answer him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for referring to my book. Modesty prevented me from doing so myself. I think that he has overlooked my request for enlightenment on the definition of obligations arising which are not proven as debts in the bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned in my reply to the hon. Gentleman that in rule 12.3(2) of the insolvency rules, several types of claim are mentioned that are not provable in bankruptcy proceedings. Claimants can, therefore, pursue their remedies against the bankrupt notwithstanding the bankruptcy. Prior to the amendments such claims included any obligation arising under an order made in family or domestic proceedings. Those have already been redefined to include domestic proceedings—under the Children Act 1989—and maintenance assessments under the Child Support Act 1991. Those are both now included in the new definition, so the amendment to the rules is an extension of the rights not provable in bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the two points—which I had divided into three, but which are linked—concerning obligations in relation to the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Children Act 1989.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
