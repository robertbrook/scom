	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Social Security (Industrial Injuries and Diseases) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 425).</p></blockquote>
Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Anderson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument amends the list of prescribed diseases for industrial injury purposes. Most importantly, it makes fundamental changes to the reduced earnings allowance for people reaching pensionable age who have been injured or contracted a disease while at work. I will concentrate my comments on the changes to the reduced earnings allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes were initially flagged up by the Secretary of State in a leaked letter to the press in October 1995, and were subsequently announced in the uprating statement made to the House. It must be stressed that no consultation has taken place with anyone beyond the Government's advisory body, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council. We feel strongly that there should have been much wider consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to put on record precisely what reduced earnings allowance is. It was intended as compensation for loss of earnings due to incapacity as a result of industrial accident or disease. It is payable to someone who is unable to return to his regular employment or undertake work of equivalent standard because of the effects of disablement caused by the accident or disease. The allowance is, therefore, payable if a claimant is incapable of carrying out his regular occupation. It is paid not because of a specific job, but because of loss of ability to earn money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allowance is based broadly on the difference between a person's earning capacity before and after the accident or disease, although it is still subject—at April 1996 figures—to a maximum payment of £39.60. It was estimated on 24 November 1995 in column 360 of 
	<i>Hansard</i> that 142,796 people received reduced earnings allowance at 2 April 1994. It must be stressed at the outset that many people will potentially be affected by the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reduced earnings allowance is no longer payable in respect of industrial injury or disease occurring since October 1990. This decision was made despite opposition from the Government's own watchdog, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, which argued that reduced earnings allowance could enable a person
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
to move to a safer or less well-paid job if they were disabled in the course of their employment. Perhaps the Minister will tell us why, in the face of opposition from their own advisory council, the Government proceeded with these changes. It was estimated that the abolition of reduced earnings allowance would save £67 million between 1990 and 1993, which would rise to £140 million by the year 2001. However, these savings were intended to fund a package of new benefits for disabled people. The Government apparently took the view that the means-tested disability working allowance would act as a replacement for reduced earnings allowance. In fact, in its 1993 period report, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council expressed "dismay" at the decision to abolish the allowance and concern that the DWA would not adequately replace it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disabled working allowance was not introduced until almost two years after the abolition of reduced earnings allowance. The take-up has run at a very poor 17 per cent. There appears to be no evidence that people injured at work are in the group now claiming disabled- working allowance instead of reduced earnings allowance. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government's position remains that DWA is the alternative to REA? How has money been spent as a result of the changes made? What is the situation regarding take-up and who is receiving the allowance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even before 1990, reduced earnings allowance had been cut. The Social Security Act 1986 reduced the amount of reduced earnings allowance by the amount of the earnings-related additional pension payable with invalidity benefit. Entitlement to reduced earnings allowance was ended for those who reached retirement age after 9 April 1989. Those who had already retired by then had preserved entitlement, but the amount was frozen and its worth was about 30 per cent. less than before reduced earnings allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, we have received a letter from the Secretary of State which tries to justify the changes before the Committee. It is a mark of the Government's discomfort over the considerable public outcry about the changes that the Secretary of State has been forced to write to Members about this debate. That shows how important the debate is and how the Government's intentions have been received by the public. We shall continue to stress the anxieties felt by particular groups and the losses that they will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only people who can now receive reduced earnings allowance are those who were in receipt of it before October 1990 who have not had a single day's break in entitlement since then—reduced earnings allowance is not payable for diseases that have been prescribed since October 1994—or those who have claimed since October 1990 for an accident or disease that occurred before that date. The number of people eligible to claim the full reduced earnings allowance has been very much reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to the proposals, the changes already made and how those changes affect people. Recipients of reduced earnings allowance who are over state retirement age has been shifted to a much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
lower-paying retirement allowance, Crucially, backdating of claims for reduced earnings allowance has been prevented from going back further than one year before the date of the claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three crucial issues need to be considered. First, there is the damage that the reduction in the amount payable will cause to specific groups, Secondly, there is the fact that the changes were introduced almost overnight without transitional protection for people who may have planned their retirement incomes on what they thought they would receive through reduced earnings allowance. Thirdly, the changes in the backdating rules have specific consequences for the benefit because of the nature of the injuries and diseases suffered by those who may be eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 6 changes the definition of regular employment for the purposes of reduced earnings allowance to be a contract of service for at least 10 hours a week. It also introduces an absolute cut-off for receipt of reduced earnings allowance at pensionable age—either 60 or 65. I will return to the discrimination on that cut-off point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change also applies during the week in which the regulations come into force, that is, 24 March 1996. In contrast to many other social security provisions, there is no transitional protection for existing reduced earnings allowance claimants at the point of change; many of them may have been on reduced earnings allowance for many years prior to 1990. The Government have the power under section 175(4) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to make transitional provisions. Their failure to do so for reduced earnings allowance claimants means that the principle of protecting existing claimants from the impact of benefit changes has finally been abandoned. Many claimants will suffer immediate cash losses upon reaching pension age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to explain why the Government have not been prepared to introduce transitional arrangements for the group of people who are so badly affected by this change in policy. 
	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> reported on 30 March 1996 that the Benefits Agency was dispatching letters to claimants asking for the return of their order books. An estimated 20,000 pensioners will lose up to £30 a week as a result of these changes, saving the Government an estimated £25 million in 1996-97 and £30 million a year thereafter. Thus there are immediate cuts in benefit with no transitional protection in order to save the Government money. It is part of their salami-slicing of the benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should contrast that with the old rules under which reduced allowance replaced reduced earnings allowance if someone was both over pension age and was giving up regular employment. On the day before giving up the work, the reduced earnings allowance award was at least £2 a week. At least some contribution was made immediately. According to a commissioner's decision, No. R(I)2/93, "regular employment" implied the intention to remain in the labour market. If a person was off sick, made redundant or on holiday, there was no intention to give up work. So long as there was one or more day's
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
interruption of employment—that is unemployment or incapacity—the person was regarded as not having given up work and therefore could be entitled to reduced earnings allowance. The effect of the new regulation is that even when there is an intention to stay in regular employment, with just one day's sickness or unemployment, a person over pension age will lose all his reduced earnings allowance entitlement and be forced to transfer to retirement allowance. Again, I would be grateful if the Minister could explain exactly why there is this change in position and an instant cut-off of this crucial benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will really suffer. The allowance under reduced earnings allowance is £39.60 a week at current benefit rates. The change to retirement allowance pays merely £10 a week which is a dramatic reduction in the amount to which families will be entitled. This proposal could cut up to £1,500 a year from the injured person's income. My hon. Friends will mention specific cases where such changes have a dramatic effect on the family income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman explain his reference to salami-slicing? What does this have to do with salami?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall assume that that was a serious question and merely point to the fact that over the past four years, this Tory Government have systematically, slice by slice, reduced the amount of benefit to key groups of people in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jessel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why salami?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are meant to be having a serious debate. I shall not respond to the hon. Gentleman's inanity. If he wants to make a serious point about cuts in benefit, of which we are considering only the latest, I shall be happy to give way. If he is not interested in the subject of the debate, perhaps it would be better if he left now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the point about potential discrimination. The cut-off age is 60 for a woman and 65 for a man. Several recent European Court cases have challenged that. One case dealt with severe disablement allowance, which now ends at 65 for men and women. I should be grateful if the Minister commented on that, and at least considered delaying the introduction of the regulations until a definitive legal judgment establishes whether discrimination between age groups can be challenged through the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with backdating the benefit. Regulations 2 and 3 limit the arrears to 12 months after a late claim or application for review. Under previous legislation, reduced earnings allowance could be fully backdated when there was good cause for a late claim. Otherwise, only three months' arrears were payable. The Government claim that the change to reduced earnings allowance simply aligns backdating industrial injury benefits with other benefits. However, the reason for unlimited backdating under previous rules is the special nature of industrial injury schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Many conditions have a long latency period, and may only emerge years after exposure to occupational hazards such as asbestos, coal dust, silica, radiation and excessive noise. Many industrial diseases may not come to light quickly. Therefore, late claims and backdated benefits are crucial. The number of deaths that are attributed to diseases caused by asbestos has steadily increased in the past 20 years. It is expected to peak in the next 15 to 25 years. Backdating should be more generous because of exposure to occupational hazards, and delay in recognising the disease. It should not simply be aligned with other benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New reduced earnings allowance claimants would have to establish that they had become disabled as a result of an industrial accident or disease more than five years ago, and that they might have suffered from the effects of such a disability for some years. Industrial injury benefits are among the most complex and least-known benefits. Advisers, solicitors and even Benefits Agency staff can misunderstand the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Backdating should be consistent with all benefits conferred by industrial injury schemes, for example, disablement benefit. Other benefits do not constitute an adequate comparison with those for industrial injuries. I hope that the Minister will comment on the special nature of the diseases from which people who apply for reduced earnings allowance may suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduced earnings allowance was abolished in 1990. Therefore, only a limited number of claimants will need to take advantage of the unlimited backdating that the Opposition believe to be appropriate. Only 2,953 new awards of reduced earnings allowance were made between April 1993 and April 1994. Those figures are taken from a written answer on 19 January 1996 at column 826 of 
	<i>Hansard.</i> They show that less than 2 per cent. of the case load sought backdating. A further restriction is at the least mean-minded—and, more importantly, it is draconian—in relation to diseases and injuries for which people might claim reduced earnings allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The detail is clear. The Government want to use the statutory instrument further to reduce the benefit for disabled people. The stark detail does not give the full colour and flavour of the anguish and problems that many people who fall foul of the benefit cut will suffer. Case after case is being presented in which people are losing significant amounts of money. Many organisations—the Disability Alliance, citizens advice bureaux, trade union councils representing many trade unions and their workers throughout the country—are coming up with cases concerning people who had planned in the belief that they would be entitled to the money through their retirement, and who are suffering significant loss of money. It is not an exaggeration to say that instances are emerging all the time in which the changes will mean an entitlement of £30 a week less than previously. That is a significant impact on family finances that have been planned in the expectation of receiving the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The Opposition do not accept the rationale behind the Government's statements on the matter. We do not buy the Secretary of State's attempt to justify the change through the letter that was sent to hon. Members today. We urge the Minister to reconsider the proposals and to ensure that people who have suffered—often drastically—because of industrial disease and injury are not further disadvantaged by the Government's mean-mindedness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that additions are being made to the list of prescribed industrial diseases in regulation 5. I take the lead from my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) in noting that the regulations constitute retrospective legislation about which the House has never taken a formal view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the regulations will deprive retired disabled people of up to £30 a week which they were told they would receive for life when they first applied for the benefit. Introducing the regulations is a miserly and cold-hearted exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's explanation for the measure, in his letter to hon. Members dated 7 May, was that
	<br><blockquote><p>"technical deficiencies in the 1988 legislation meant that some people continued to receive Reduced Earnings Allowance after they had retired."</p></blockquote>
My view is that there were no technical deficiencies in the 1988 legislation. Parliament approved the measures then without full knowledge of what they contained. Many Members of this Parliament were not in Parliament in 1988. The House did not want a benefit that was given to people for life to be taken away from them. The Social Security Act 1988 prevented new applicants from being accepted on to the reduced earnings allowance scheme after October 1990. It did not provide—nor, I believe, was it intended to—that current recipients of REA would have their benefit stopped when they retired. I do not believe that Parliament agreed to that. If the Minister disagrees, I hope that he will point out the evidence for his view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson), the Leader of the House said, during business questions on 25 April at column 604, that Parliament "agreed … the principle" of the legislation. It is a nice way with words: "We agree the principle, now all we have to do is slide it under the door, with no chance of amendment. We will have a one-and-a-half hour debate upstairs in a Committee Room after we have enacted the regulations."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a shabby way to treat thousands of our constituents and their Members of Parliament. I wonder what our constituents think of us. We are supposed to legislate, yet the Executive treat us in this roughshod way. We should understand that we are discussing people who are unable to work to their full potential because of industrial injuries or diseases. Their earnings potential has been reduced through no fault of their own. Parliament rightly took the view that people who became partially disabled in that way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
should be eligible for support for the rest of their lives and that was the basis of the reduced earnings allowance—or hardship allowance as it was called when I worked in industry. It was the basis on which people receiving REA planned their spending and savings. They thought that they were permanently entitled to the payment as part of their compensation for being injured at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of those affected is my constituent Mr. Hughie Craig, with whom I worked in industry many years ago. He was born in 1928 and started work at the age of 14 in coal mining, where he stayed for many years until he had an accident which left him entitled to receive the reduced earnings allowance. He told me in a letter that he was
	<br><blockquote><p>"unable to continue on [his] pre-accident job which means a loss of earnings for the rest of [his] life".</p></blockquote>
My constituent was told after his accident, many years ago, that the reduced earnings allowance would be payable for the rest of his life. But he was unlucky enough to reach retirement age after 9 April 1989. The Government have reduced his £38.12 a week to £9.90 without any Act or Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Craig told me that the first he knew of a change in the law was when he received a letter dated 28 March asking him to return his REA benefit book, which he did. The letter from the Benefits Agency told him only that
	<br><blockquote><p>"due to a change in the law … we may need to adjust your order book".</p></blockquote>
The letter to Hughie Craig did not mention the fact that a possible reduction was planned. No warning was given and when he asked a member of the local Benefits Agency staff why he had to return his book, she told him that she did not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three days later, the Benefits Agency wrote again to Mr. Craig telling him that, with immediate effect, he would lose almost £30 a week. Following an emergency telephone call to my home that evening, my constituent wrote to me stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If this new law is carried through, I will find it very difficult to live and to manage".</p></blockquote>
He told me that he had planned his finances including the REA as it was a lifetime payment, agreed by the state. He has a mortgage, bills and regular commitments and losing £30 a week without notice and without proper transitional arrangements, which my hon. Friend the Member for Withington mentioned, will severely damage his ability to make ends meet. Mr. Craig added in his letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Surely, by law, we should have received notice of any change in our benefits. Normally we can accept or appeal against the change."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not accept this change. By the way it is being carried out, it is not fair or just. The people receiving REA cannot afford to lose this kind of money."</p></blockquote>
My constituent is not unique. In a parliamentary Answer in January, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) told the House that in April 1994 more than 140,000 people received the reduced earnings allowance, nearly 55,000 of whom were over
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
pensionable age. All those who retired after April 1989 will lose under the terms of the regulations and they will only be the first. Those already identified by the Minister will be followed by anyone who has since been disabled at work and transferred to a job on reduced earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituent, Mr. Craig, is not happy. He rightly summed up the Minister's attitude, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Government have no respect for the elderly. They are attacking the weak and vulnerable. They seem to think that senior citizens have no rights. We have been attacked and mugged."</p></blockquote>
That is how he feels. Just under £30 a week being taken from someone such as him at the whim of the Government means that he has every right to feel that he has been mugged by the Secretary of State for Social Security. I agree entirely with those sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are mean-minded and mean-spirited regulations. They will cut spending for the needy, presumably so that money can be found for Budget day handouts later this year. Yet just £20 million will be squeezed from elderly disabled people by the measure. Can that sort of money be better spent on tax bribes? I do not think that anyone with any feelings of fairness and justice would believe that it could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are unfair. Their detail has never been agreed, but they have already been enacted—the will of Parliament has been circumvented. I ask hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, what justice there is in Members of Parliament, on the basis of some sort of vote in 1988 taking from people who suffered industrial accidents 20 years ago a benefit that those people thought would go with them for the rest of their lives—to their graves. It is outrageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have undermined Parliament's judgment by retrospectively changing the law. If they were saying that people who were injured in future would receive the benefit only until retirement I might not agree, but there would be more justice in that than in taking a benefit from a person who has been receiving it for decades, thinking that it would continue for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change has been carried out without express parliamentary approval. Sorting this out in a Committee Room at this hour is no way to deal with the matter. The change has been carried out without consultation and in a way that undermines Members of Parliament. There has been very little advance warning to our constituents—the people who are most affected by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge hon. Members to reject the regulations, if for no other reason than to show Ministers that they cannot ride roughshod over Members of Parliament and our responsibilities to our constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Anderson, to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall talk about the human cost of the regulations. A great many of my constituents will have problems facing the hardship of a cut of nearly £30. The supposed size of the problem for the Government will diminish anyway, because with incapacity benefit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
replacing invalidity benefit people will lose that money at retirement age. Why are the Government insisting on penalising people who have been receiving this benefit as well?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the supposed logic behind the regulations, the change will hit people extremely hard. Up to 20,000 people will lose nearly £30 a week. They were not prepared for that, and did not know that they would suddenly have £30 taken from their income. To those people, £30 is a great deal of money. They are not earning vast sums and able to spare £30, but will have to cut back on food, clothes and essentials. They need the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man who came to my surgery in Rochdale on Saturday was devastated by what has happened, having just received the letter telling him that he would lose the money. He said, "what am I going to do? I have budgeted for the money. I have outgoings. How can I suddenly cut back?" The money has been taken away suddenly—there is no transitional relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received several letters from constituents, one of whom wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was very angry and devastated last week to find that without any warning or explanation my disablement benefit has been cut from thirty nine pounds to nine pounds. How can there be any justification in this action on older people? Obviously any disability worsens with age not improves.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Thirty nine pounds is a very big drop in my income every week and my standard of living will be severely reduced.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There must be thousands of people in this situation".</p></blockquote>
I warn the Government that this is just the beginning: all Members of Parliament, including Conservative Members, will have people coming into their surgeries saying that they cannot manage because their disablement benefit has been cut. I have another letter from a constituent in Rochdale, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing to let you know, how disgusted I was"—people have used the word "disgusted"—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to receive a letter this morning from Social Security, requesting me to return my allownace book for Industrial Injuries, because it now becomes Retirement allowance, and payment will be at a lower rate. When phoning Social Security to find what the lower rate was, I was told that as from 24th of March, it would be reduced from £38.12 per week, down to £9.53 per week.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I understand that my retirement will not start until I am 65 years old, therefore I can not understand why the change is now? When I am only 63 years old, and my date of birth is 1932."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I was informed by the Social Security in Rochdale, some time ago, that when the change was made, this would not effect me because I had been claiming Industrial Injuries for a good number of years."</p></blockquote>
Those are just two letters, but I believe that every Member of Parliament could have brought many more to the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government might claim that people should have known about this cut because of the Social Security Act 1988. How could the constituents who come to my surgery have known that, in March, £29 or £30 a week would be taken away from them? Most Members of Parliament did not even know. As the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) said, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Act was passed before some of is had been elected to Parliament. If we did not know, how were our constituences supposed to know?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The severe, sudden drop in income from £39.60 a week to £9.90 will have a devasting effect. Many of the people affected were low earners. Because they were disbaled as a result of an industrial injury, they could not earn a great deal, and they have not saved. We are not talking about wealthy people who can afford such a cut. This is a savage cut in income for recipients but it will result in small savings for the Government. I urge them to think again and reverse this cut. It would not cost a great deal, but it would help my constituents in Rochdale and everyone else in the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Judith Church 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by referring Members of the Committee, particularly Conservative Members, to regulation 5. I know that often, when we deal with statutory Instruments, not everyone has had time to read the regulations and consider them in any detail. I should like to draw the Committee's attention to some of the additions made by the regulations to the schedules for industrial injuries and prescribed diseases. Carpal tunnel syndrome, for example, is extraordinarily unpleasant. I do not know whether any Members of the Committee has encountered a constituent who has it. It is the sort of occupational disease to which those outside who are working on the Jubilee line extension and the new Parliament building are exposed. The sort of construction work that a modern society needs the building industry to do requires people to use handheld power tools. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an extremely debilitating disease—people who suffer from it are unable to hold or lift things, and are in constant pain for a large part of their life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allergic rhinitis, referred to in regulation 5(7), arises in a number of industries; for example from isocyanates in the paint industry, platinum salts in the electronics industry and epoxy resins from a number of industries. Those are welcome additions because the old regulations did not reflect the modern nature of manufacturing. The regulations are a catching-up exercise. Many people were suffering from these conditions and struggling for years to have them recognised as prescribed industrial diseases, but Governments did not see fit to do so. Other examples include the enzymes in detergent manufacture, the antibiotics in the pharmaceutical industry and reactive dyes, textiles and materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not draw hon. Members' attention to this list and go through it in great detail to be pedantic. It may seem to some hon. Members that many of these conditions are rather exotic. They are not the sort of things than many of us come across in our working lives, particularly in Parliament. However, we know that many of our constituents work day in, day out, throughout their lives with many of those conditions. We cannot avoid people working with such agents if we want to live in a modern society. If we want plastic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
objects and the benefits of modern society, we have to have these agents as part of our industrial manufacturing base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be nice if such hazardous substances which are being used in the workplace were properly controlled, as they should be under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1988. In a previous occupation, I had some part in drafting those. The sad fact is that many of those substances are poorly controlled in the workplace. We know that many of the people who are getting prescribed industrial diseases and who are suffering from ill-health in the workplace are doing so because of poor management and poor control. It is not their fault that they end up with these diseases; they are doing jobs which we, perhaps, do not want do do. I do not know about Conservative Members, but a number of Opposition Members have experienced industrial diseases from work that they have done in previous occupations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the Government do not understand the burden carried by such people, which is the legacy of our advanced, modern, industrial society. People who suffer these diseases often have been debilitated early in life. People in their 20s have been exposed to some of the products that cause allergic rhinitis. They are unable to work because they have tremendous respiratory difficulties. They cannot get up and down stairs and they are young people with young families. In some of the more hazardous industries such as the building industry and the chemicals and plastic industry, of which I have personal experience, people have been paralysed after falls and suffer from huge disabilities as a result of the work that we as a society want them to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one will say that we can cast adrift those people because of the sacrifices that they have made in their working lives, but I suggest to the Government that, in a sense, the regulations largely will cast them adrift. The Government are saying to them, "You made the sacrifice, but suddenly, we are going to take away your money. We will not give you any warning, and we are not even saying that we are sorry for not warning you." As the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) said, people were turning up to claim their benefits and then finding out that they had been cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have considerable experience of these matters, which is why it is important that we are having this debate. I sometimes wonder whether Conservative Members know enough about these matters to understand what is going on. My hon. Friend the Member for Withington previously worked in the health service, which picks up a substantial part of the bill for people who are injured at work. My hon. Friends the Members for Rother Valley and for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) had experience in the mining industry and in trade unions before they came into the House. I worked in industry for a number of years as one of Her Majesty's inspectors of factories, investigating occupational ill-health, disease and industrial action and, on the criminal law side, trying to pick up the pieces of devastated lives. I recognised that those people could
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
no longer expect to lead a normal working life and to live with their families in the way that we all hope and expect to. Their industrial disease or accident meant that the rest of their lives would be substantially less pleasant. Those people have suffered the consequences of their accident or disease—the pain, the months in hospital, the rehabilitation—and they now have to learn to do things that we take for granted in our daily lives. For the Government to cut such people' benefits because they want to save money is extremely cruel and callous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mine is a manual working constituency with much engineering. People are involved in noisy industry and must work amid paint and welding fumes, and many of them have accidents with machinery. I regularly see many of those people: some—particularly those who worked in the car and related engineering industries—come to Labour party meetings, while others come to my surgeries. I cannot justify what is happening to them; indeed, I cannot even explain it—they are being treated cruelly and callously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Opposition Members have noted—and it is worth repeating—that the average loss is about £30 a week. That sum might not seem much to Conservative Members, but it does to me and it represents a substantial part of their income for the people who receive it. The hon. Member for Rochdale said that people might have to do without the bare necessities and alter their life style. They might be living a little above the breadline and using the money to treat their grandchildren to outings and presents; they might use it to buy items that are a normal part of the life that they want to live. I doubt whether people will cut back on those things, but they will cut back on their heating, diets and basic pleasures to make ends meet and to treat their families in the way that the £1,500 a year leads them to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members opened their salary statements at the end of the month and found that an equivalent sum—perhaps £600—had been knocked off, they would ring the Fees Office and say, "Hang on, what's going on this month? We've lost £600." They would be told that the Government had introduced new regulations and that they were no longer entitled to the money. There would be outrage—Conservative Members could not do that to themselves. I do not understand, therefore, how the Government can behave in the way that they have towards ordinary working people who are not at fault for what has happened to them in their working lives and whose families will have to bear the brunt of their accident and injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have noted that we are seeing the tip of an iceberg in terms of people's awareness of the Government's proposals, and matters will get worse. People in the more affluent constituencies might not get so many prescribed industrial diseases. The experience of my hon. Friends and myself may be unique, but I know of people in all constituencies who are suffering from industrial accidents and diseases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One never knows when it is going to happen: even professional people have accidents at work and suffer from occupational disease. One of the new substances
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
added to the regulations—I am pleased to see it there—is glutaraldehyde, which is used in medical laboratories for diagnostic tests. It is a disinfective material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing with exotic things that we know nothing about, though there may be some exotic things that Conservative Members do not know much about. I beg them to listen to what we have to say this afternoon and to take note of the correspondence that they have received from constituents, the public and various organisations. They must recognise that the proposals are unjust. They may represent another nail in the Government's coffin, but, more seriously, they will harm a number of our fellow citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clapham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measures outlined in the regulations are monstrously unjust. Disablement benefit derives from 1948 legislation and has existed ever since, Its underlying principle is loss of faculty, which replaced the loss of earnings principle. In turn, that derived from older workmen's compensation Acts which preceded the 1948 legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people are assessed under disability regulations, they are given a fixed, provisional or life assessment. Following a serious accident, a chap or a woman will be given a provisional assessment until the medical condition settles. That is generally followed by life final assessment. With loss of faculty, the person's ability to return to the pre-accident job or to take on a job of an equivalent standard is impaired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until October 1986, such people could receive a benefit known as special hardship allowance. From that date, it became reduced earnings allowance. It allowed the person to continue with the job, albeit with reduced remuneration in comparison with the pre-accident employment, and to plan for the future. It became compensation for loss of faculty and for loss of pension rights. Many such people did not pursue common law damages claims, so had no loss of pension rights. Reduced earnings allowance or special hardship allowance did compensate for loss of pension rights. Will the Minister tell us whether he intends to suggest to the trustees of occupational pension schemes that adjustments should be made when reduced earnings allowance has been further reduced and that pension rights should be restored to the level that they would have reached had the accident not taken place? Perhaps the Minister could address that point in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the letter which, as we have heard, has been distributed this morning. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pensioners currently receiving REA incorrectly will have their benefit reduced when they are transferred to Retirement Allowance."</p></blockquote>
I take issue with that. The Minister should consider the regulations stemming from 1948 legislation, which stress the loss of faculty principle. When a life assessment is given, it is for life. If there is any unforeseen aggravation, the injured person can ask for
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
a review. But the benefit provided is a life benefit. As the disablement benefit is given for life, the injured person could, if his earnings capacity were affected, apply for reduced earnings allowance, which is an extension of the disablement benfit and is, therefore, a benefit given for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final paragraph of the letter is incorrect. Perhaps the Minister will deal with that point in his reply. People who have been injured at work, can no longer go back to their pre-accident or pre-disease work and, as a consequence, suffer a loss of earnings are given REA for two reasons: to compensate them for loss of faculty and for loss of pension rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restriction of REA to 12 months is a monstrous injustice. Regularly on a Friday afternoon in my constituency I meet constituents who are unable to pay for a solicitor to represent them before medical appeal tribunals. Recently, I had two cases, the first of which I shall use as an example involving industrial injury, and the second as an example relating to an industrial disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first case involved a chap called Mr. Morris of Birdwell in Barnsley, who had sustained a head injury at work in 1985. Unfortunately, the solicitors had settled the claim without having had a computerised scan. Initially, the man had a very pronounced tremor, and a year after the accident doctors diagnosed Parkinson's disease. In 1993, the family were concerned about his condition, so they obtained a second opinion, which suggested that it could have been related to the accident that he had sustained at work in 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man was brought down to London to be examined by a specialist neurologist, who confirmed that, in his view, the greater part of Mr. Morris's condition related to the accident that he had sustained at work. We, therefore, made a fresh application for disablement benefit. We established the disablement benefit at 70 per cent. Having established that, there was a potential claim for reduced earnings allowance. As the disablement benefit was backdated to the date of the accident in 1985, so was the reduced earnings allowance that accompanied it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of an injury that, although dicovered 10 years after the accident, was deemed to be related to it. Yet the Government are now proposing to restrict the reduced earnings allowance to 12 months. That is an injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second case involved asbestosis. A miner had worked in the 1950s with a machine that had had an asbestos lining. As a result, he had become totally diabled by a chest disease. A biopsy established that he had asbestos bodies in his lung. Part of his lung had been removed because of the disease he had contracted as a result of working with asbestos. We were able to persuade the medical appeal tribunal that the benefit should be backdated. It was backdated to the 1970s, which gave the man the opportunity to make a claim for reduced earnings allowance. His disease meant that he could no longer work as he had prior to the disease; he had to take an occupation in which his earnings were much less than they would have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
As a result of the regulations, people in such cases will no longer be able to apply for reduced earnings allowance. It is monstrous that such a situation is imposed on us without the opportunity properly to scrutinise the regulations on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we welcome the extension of the number of prescribed diseases, further examination of some of the recommendations causes concern. On the meaning of regular employment, we have moved from a mere reference to employment to accepting that it will mean 10 hours, work or more a week over an average of five weeks. That means that a man can work 30 hours—perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong; I am responding to his frown. Under regulation 6, regular employment is defined as employment
	<br><blockquote><p>"which a person undertakes for an average of 10 hours or more per week in any period of five consecutive weeks."</p></blockquote>
To me, that suggests quite a change compared to the previous legislation. It suggests that a man can work 30 hours for one week and five hours for the next four weeks, but still fall within the regulation because he averages 10 hours over a five-week period. If my interpretation is wrong, perhaps the Minister can correct it. That is what the regulation suggests to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My puzzlement and my look of surprise were because the regulation replaces wording in the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Regular Employment) Regulations 1990 and the specific aspect does not materially change.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that correction, but it appeared to me that the emphasis was because there had been quite a change. The fact that the reduced earnings allowance has been cut without any transitional relief has hit many of my constituents extremely hard. Unlike Conservative Members, perhaps, I hold regular surgeries on Friday afternoons and Saturday mornings and during the past three weeks, I have had two or three people at each surgery whose reduced earnings allowance has been cut by up to £30 a week. As I said earlier, reduced earnings allowance is an extension of disablement benefit and the final paragraph of the letter that has gone out is incorrect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have already emphasised the effect of backdating through the two examples that I gave—it is monstrously unjust. I urge Cosnervative Members to bear in mind the injustices in the regulations and to oppose them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be brief and to be disciplined in what I say. I do not want to let the Government or the Minister off the hook. Many questions have been raised in Committee and I want the Minister to have time to answer them. It is outrageous that we have only one and a half hours in Committee to discuss the proposals, which are already in force and causing such great anxiety, not only to my constituents but to people all over the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not labour what has already been said. Suffice it to say, the Government have once again acted in contempt of Parliament. How is it that new regulations came into force in March this year, yet the Government have not brought the regulatory amendments to the House for full and proper parliamentary scrutiny? We cannot properly scrutinise the regulatory amendments now. How can the Government get away with changing people's incomes while ensuring that the changes do not receive proper scrutiny from Parliament? That makes a mockery of Parliament. I can understand my constituents asking, "Why do you raise such issues when the Government take no notice whatever of what is said?" It is outrageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many constituents have visited my surgery. It is always clear what the issues of the day are because, as other hon. Members have said, we do not get one or two queries; endless streams of people come to my constituency surgery and say, "How can they do this, Joan? How can they take away 75 per cent. of my allowance, which I expected to be paid for life?" When those premiums were awarded, life meant life and it should still mean life; they should not be removed in this way when people reach retirement age. I share my constituents' anger about all that has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One particular constituent talked about the special hardship allowance, or whatever it was that people received at the time. Although people could have made compensation claims against their employers, in many cases they did not because they felt that they had obtained a decent allowance—for life—on which they could manage. They accepted that and it is therefore all the more difficult for them to accept the reduced income that they have now. The figure of 25 per cent. once they reach retirement age is unacceptable. Furthermore, it is clear that women are being particularly hard hit. They lose 75 per cent. of their income at the age of 60 because of the Government's failure to deal with the equalisation of the pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take my points on board. I have letters from constituents with me. There are miners with emphysema and miners with bronchitis. They are now ex-miners, who cannot manage on the amount that they are being paid. The Government have stolen the money that was awarded to them. I want to hear what the Minister has to say about that and all the other issues that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

All my life, I was a member of the National Union of Mineworkers and worked in the mines.

Some are constituents, some are ex-colleagues and some are good friends. They tell me that what has happened to them is unbelievable. They accepted life assessment. They gave their health to an industry and they cannot give any more, bar their life. Instead of existing—which is what they do now—they had some comfort from that money. For a person on a fixed income, £30 is a lot money—any person who has retired on a fixed income would tell us that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act has been enacted by default. It is a crime to tidy it up, together with the regulations with an hour and half of discussion when hon. Members have not had a full debate on the issue. More than 25,000 people will be affected, and many more will be in the future. Is not that a reason for a full debate? We often go home early—sometimes we have no business on a Tuesday or a Thursday, and Mondays are nonsense. There is ample time in the parliamentary calendar to discuss such issues. Will the Minister give us such an opportunity, even at this late stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have given many examples and I do not want to repeat them, but the situation is critical for those individuals. The Government have not heard the end of it because the Secretary of State for Social Security will be lobbied when he goes up to Scotland on 20 May and will hear from some of the individuals affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a sneaking regard for what the hon. member for Midlothian said about our going home early without having properly debated the regulations. Dealing with matters that are of importance to constituents under parliamentary procedure can be problematic. However, today is an Opposition Supply day and the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have the opportunity to raise such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations were laid before Parliament on 1 March and came into force on 24 March. For reasons that the usual channels will understand, the debate is taking place in Committee. Even if the full impact of the proposals had not been appreciated—sometimes people on the ground do not discover the importance for them of what Parliament does until later—they were canvassed last autumn, announced in the uprating statement and have been in the public domain since last November. I can accept the argument that we should discuss them at greater length, but not the criticism of the fact that we are in Committee today, because that was the choice of all those involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
I can understand that some Opposition Members feel strongly that the 1988 legislation—which occurred, as the hon. Member for Rochdale commented, before some members of the Committee were in Parliament—was wrong. However, we must not confuse the fundamental change that took place in 1988 with the implementation of those changes through the regulations. The suggestion that we have heard that compensation for loss of earning capacity should extend to a period after retirement is slightly startling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I have completed my point, I shall give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988, the principle was laid down that if one was getting reduced earnings allowace when one retired, one moved to retirement allowance. I can accept that Opposition Members may not be happy with that legislative change, but that is what Parliament enacted all that time ago and the regulations implement that change. I want to explain in some detail, before we end at 6 o'clock, what has gone wrong in the intervening period and why the Government see the need for the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did Parliament decide in 1988 to get rid of the benefit that many thousands of people in this country had been given for life, well before 1988?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am mystified by the hon. Gentleman's point because clause 2 of the then Social Security Bill provided that that would happen. That is not the issue at stake. The issue is at what stage and in what circumstances the transition takes place from reduced earnings allowance to the retirement allowance that the 1988 legislation introduced. If one is over pensionable age and one gives up employment, one moves from one scheme to the other. We are arguing about a category of people who are retired and not working, but who, because of the way the regulations have operated, have been receiving reduced earnings allowance. The Government contend that that is anomalous and seek to put it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1988, there have also been considerable changes to the benefit system in regard to disabilities and related matters. The industrial injuries disability benefit and reduced earnings allowance apply only to employed earners. Modern benefits are more widely applicable. The Government have redrawn the basis of disability benefits so that the disablement, not the condition of being in employment, is the determining criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention behind the 1988 introduction of retirement allowance was clear. When people reach pensionable age and are not working, their entitlement to reduced earnings allowance should cease. The benefit is intended to compensate for loss of earnings due to an accident or disease sustained at work. It is geared and directed to an actual loss of earnings during a person's working life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Once people end their working life, reduced earnings allowance is no longer appropriate. Retirement allowance is then the relevant benefit. That recognises that reduced earnings during a person's working life can lead to reduced earnings-related pension rights. The industrially injured pensioner still receives a preferential, non-contributory, tax-free benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the disability criterion is the underpinning factor. When a man who was injured at work retires, he is still disabled. The loss of faculty for which he is being compensated is still with him. REA is part of disablement benefit, and should remain so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand that argument, but it ended in 1988, when Parliament made the primary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is misleading the Committee on that point. Will he give us chapter and verse for what he considers to be his authority on the matter? Some Members were not in Parliament at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely puzzled. Perhaps the argument is not focused sufficiently precisely. I am referring to section 2 of the Social Security Act 1988. It states that a person who
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<ol>
	<li>"has attained pensionable age; and</li>

	<li>retires, or is deemed … to have retired, from regular employment on or after the date on which his section comes into force; and</li>

	<li>was entitled to reduced earnings allowance … on the day immediately before he retired or is deemed to have retired,</li></ol>
shall cease to be entitled to reduced earnings allowance as from the day on which he retires or is deemed to have retired and may be entitled to it again only if he makes an election in accordance with regulations":</p></blockquote>
That is what the legislation states. Our debate has missed the question of what should be the triggering event when a person moves from reduced earnings allowance to retirement allowance. The Government contend that to have given up work but still to receive reduced earnings allowance is neither right nor consistent with the broad principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present arrangements are unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. First, it is technically possible to manipulate the present arrangements so that a person never passes from reduced earnings allowance to retirement allowance. For example, if a person gave up employment the week before her 60th—or his 65th—birthday, the old arrangements meant that that person never passed from reduced earnings allowance to retirement allowance. That was arbitrary and unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second difficulty was that commissioners' decisions were based on the test of giving up employment. You, Mr. Anderson, as a member of the Bar, will appreciate this sort of legal argument instinctively. Does giving up employment involve an element of intention? The better view of evolving authority was that it does. That leads to all sorts of curiosities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
If one is made redundant, it appears that one does not give up employment, so one cannot ever pass from retirement earnings allowance to retirement allowance. If sacked, there is the difficult issue of whether people deliberately caused themselves to be sacked. If they deliberately and intentionally did so, it may well be that they intended to give up employment. Anything less than that would not suffice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements for determining whether one moved from one allowance to the other were unsatisfactory, arbitrary, irrational and unjust. They made no policy sense and were grossly unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minster give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way first to the hon. Member for Rochdale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minster was saying that people could give up work before retirement age and retain reduced earnings allowance for the rest of their lives. But does not that apply only to invalidity benefit? Is incapacity benefit taken away on retirement? Will the Minister clarify the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the case. What I said was broader and simpler. Before the regulations, if employment was given up before pension age bithday, one was in the privileged position of remaining on reduced earnings allowance and not being transferable to retirement allowance. That does not make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barron</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister uses the word "arbitrary", yet the Government have decided that anyone retiring on a reduced earnings allowance after 9 April 1989 will lose 75 per cent. of it. That allowance, however, was granted on the precise criterion that anyone retiring before 8 April 1989 could keep 100 per cent. of it. What is more arbitrary that that? It is grossly unfair. The Government are acting arbitrarily and are entirely wrong to introduce these regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can accept the hon. Gentleman's displeasure. However, the question at issue was ventilated, argued and resolved in 1988. The question now is whether the 1988 arrangements are working fairly and reasonably. We do not believe that they are, which is why we are proposing the regulations. Their main purpose is to ensure that reduced earnings allowance can be recieved after retirement age only if the person is in regular employment. That makes sense because it is compensation for a loss of earning capacity. If someone carries on working after pension age, reduced earnings allowance is payable. If someone is retired, retirement allowance is appropriate. That is rational and reasonable.—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the hon. Member for Rother Valley believes that it was wrong in 1988, but the matter was dealt with then. We are now proposing to implement a policy that is rational, fair and just to all involved based upon what was decided by Parliament in the statute of 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if it was the will of Parliament at the time, by the Minister's own admission it was not implemented correctly. Why, then, have the Government decided to abandon transitional protection which would ensure that people do not suffer unduly as a consequence of the change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From consideration of the result of changing commissioners' decisions and of the way in which the system has operated, it is not clear that those who have succeeded in preserving their reduced earnings allowance are always in the direst need for it. We do, of course, sympathise with some, but as the arrangements have evolved they have not proved to be a satisfactory solution. The Government have taken the view, therefore, that, as a matter of legislative principle and rational social policy, it makes sense to provide reduced earnings allowance when people are in employment. If one is not working, retirement allowance is the more appropriate. That is understandable, clear-cut, fair and honourable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the change was made from invalidity to incapacity benefit, with the same reduction in rates and pay, transitional protection ensured that people did not lose significant amounts of money—as people who are changing from reduced earnings to retirement allowance are expected to. Why have the Government changed the principle of protection through transitional relief?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The category does not always obviously form one particular group. Some people have taken advantage of the situation, while others have suffered from it. This is not an appropriate case for transitional protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I sit down, I want to make it clear that the effects of the commissioners' recent decisions cut both ways. It has been said that the regulations are retrospective. Strictly speaking, however, the older regime operated until 24 March, when the regulations came into effect. The Benefits Agency has had to identify every case over pensionable age for both allowances. That is necessary because we must consider wider issues than simply what happened in the past if someone intentionally gave up his job. Decisions taken until 24 March will be checked and reviewed if they are wrong. People will get what they were entitled to up to that date. The second purpose of the trawl is to identify the cases to which the regulations will apply once they come into effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have very little time now. Can the Minister explain the principle behind restricting backdating to 12 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a separate point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Church</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall deal with it. I gave way because I thought—wrongly—that a question had arisen from my remarks. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone went on, however, to raise a further and, I accept, perfectly important point.
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The hon. Gentleman has to be careful with the position that he—or perhaps one of his colleagues—outlined. In some cases—particularly involving latent disease—one does not backdate under the previous arrangements until earning capacity has been affected. We must, therefore, not overstate the number of years that we should go back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These issues show a lack of awareness. Many cases of latent disease have resulted in men doing light work for 20 years. It has taken that long to prove that they were doing so because of an accident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that. There will be such difficult cases, but to suggest that every case will be the same is far from the mark. The disability or disease must affect earning capacity. The Government's basic point is, however, different: the benefits are designed to compensate for pressing immediate need, and backdating over a long period is unfair and unreasonable. The 12 month provision is comparable to arrangements for other benefits, and should, therefore, apply here. To continue backdating indefinitely for a benefit that was in effect abolished—with exceptions—more than five years ago goes further than is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, the regulations have other aspects. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Ms. Church) went into detail about some important provisions. As she welcomed them, however, I might be excused for not going into detail. We obviously take the advice of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, on which the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry are represented. The council also includes several experts who advise us on bringing the categories up to date. I am glad that that aspect of the regulations has been welcomed, although I accept that there is controversy about the reduced earnings allowance. The principle behind the regulations is, however, the rational and logical continuation of Parliament's decision in 1988. It is sensible policy and the appropriate solution socially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
