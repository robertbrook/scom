	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the European Scrutiny Committee for setting up the debate. We welcome the opportunity to outline our approach to the directives and to answer questions that members of the Committee may wish to ask. Naturally, we shall take their views into account in future discussions and negotiations. I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will agree to the motion in support of the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government fully support the environmental objectives of the two directives. The proposal on waste electrical and electronic equipment—WEEE—aims to protect the environment through the prevention of waste by increasing the recycling and recovery of WEEE and improving the environmental performance of all operators. The proposal on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment—ROHS—aims, first, to ensure harmonisation of legislation controlling hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and, secondly, to limit the environmental impact of electrical and electronic equipment when it reaches the end of its life through the minimisation of the use of hazardous substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that the growing number of EU member states taking unilateral action in such areas makes it increasingly important for a level playing field to be created by taking action through European legislation. It is important for us to note that the aims of the proposals are very much in line with the United Kingdom's policy and the goals that are set out in the national waste strategies. In spite of that, the Government have several worries about the texts of the documents. Members of the Committee have said that there is a wide variation between the cost estimates given in our regulatory impact assessment and that the costs seem to outweigh the environmental benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to make it clear during the debate that the proposals offer real environmental benefits and that they support existing environmental legislation. Our regulatory impact assessments contain several options to take into account various outcomes of our negotiations and consider a range of possible implementation strategies, hence the cost variations. Our main concern will always be to ensure that we can implement the directives in a way that is practical for the United Kingdom, thus maximising the environmental benefits without compromising our competitiveness in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for practicality, we want a WEEE directive that is clear about what it is setting out to do and how it
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
intends to do it. Lack of clarity will make the proposals difficult to implement and to enforce. During our negotiations, we have helped provide more clarity, while retaining the flexibility that we need to suit the United Kingdom's circumstances. I do not claim that everything is perfect, but real improvements have been achieved as a result of negotiations. We have also achieved a significant reduction in the likely costs of collection and provisions that will make the collection requirements less burdensome to put into practice by introducing more options for retailer take-back. We have fought hard for measures that will be helpful to small firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we fully support the environmental goals in the proposals and welcome the challenging targets, it is essential that any targets proposed are achievable within the time constraints set out and are easy to measure. The common position text is helpful in that respect. We have made clear our strong objections to the European Parliament's proposed changes to the recovery targets and its proposal to remove the time-limited derogation for small firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking maximum flexibility for some provisions, such as the producer responsibility financing requirements in the WEEE directive, so that member states can implement them in the most suitable manner. We will resist the Parliament's calls for near-mandatory individual producer responsibility, as we believe that what is proposed will impinge on our ability to implement the directive in the manner best suited to the United Kingdom and could have a significant effect on the competitiveness of UK manufacturers, particularly small firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the ROHS directive, we have sought to ensure that, when a substitute is not available or practical for the substances that are to be replaced, all applications are accounted for and granted appropriate derogations. That has been particularly successful with regard to lead soldering. Exemptions now allow the continued use of lead in cases in which safety and durability are critical, such as telephone switching systems and data storage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We continue to be concerned about the potential effects of the WEEE directive on small businesses. In addition to negotiating amendments to the text that would be helpful to such businesses, we have been working with the Small Business Service to heighten awareness of the directives among all levels of industry. We have instituted a small business focus group and have planned several seminars around the country for the autumn. We are also working with the devolved Administrations to ensure that the same message is repeated in their regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are already talking to a wide range of businesses, including manufacturers and retailers, as well as local authorities, and will intensify that dialogue once the texts are finalised. There have been several conciliation meetings this month. I expect agreement to be reached around the end of September.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that questions should be brief and asked one at a time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>There is likely to be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always good to hear a Scottish Minister talking about a WEEE directive from Brussels. I am sure that he would be the first to admit that the directive is anything but WEEE; it is fairly major. It went through several metamorphoses when the Parliament had a go at it. Will the Minister outline for the Committee where we are in terms of the text? The European Scrutiny Committee noted that the common position text was not available to it when it considered the matter. Will the Minister make it clear which of the Parliament's amendments have been accepted by the Commission, and the cases in which the UK Parliament disagrees with the common position text and intends to amend it further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have mentioned some of the subject areas on which we disagree with the text. I shall briefly run through the timetable. The conciliation commenced this month. It is expected that it will be completed in September or October. The publication of the final text is intended to follow in November. The WEEE directive—I take the hon. Gentleman's point about its name; I must try to enunciate the extra "e" at the end to distinguish it from "wee"—commences in the UK in June 2004. Financial obligations will commence in June 2005 and the recovery and recycling targets should be achieved by December 2006. The timetable for the ROHS directive is roughly parallel to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asks in what respects we disagree with the Parliament. On WEEE, the Parliament wants to place more emphasis on individual producer responsibility. It wants to make separation of WEEE from household waste compulsory for consumers in order to increase collection rates. It wants to remove from the directive's financing requirements the 30-month exemption for micro-companies, on the ground that that could distort the single market. It proposes to increase, and to make compulsory, the separate collection target: from 4 kg to 6 kg a year per head of population. We already do slightly better than that. It proposes that recovery targets should be increased by 10 per cent., from 80 per cent. to 90 per cent., while recycling targets remain the same as in the common position text, and that manufacturers provide manuals for recyclers and re-use organisations for all products. In each case we have significant disagreements with the Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to reducing certain types of material in electronic components, surely the key question is what is practical—what can be changed and still have the equipment work? Has the Minister held meetings with companies such as Intel and other component manufacturers to find out what could be done now and what needs to wait until new technological developments come along?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I personally have not held such meetings; nor, as far as I am aware, have they been sought. However, there is close consultation with the industry at both UK and EU levels. A clear parameter
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
for our approach to the directive would be not to introduce any measures that were either impossible to implement or to the competitive disadvantage of British industry. Ad hoc groups work on such issues. One involves retailers, another manufacturers, and another local authorities. Issues such as those that my hon. Friend properly raises are being discussed in the appropriate group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about the conciliation process now under way between the Parliament and the Council. What is the position of UK Labour Members of the European Parliament? As far as he is aware, will the UK Labour group in the European Parliament support the British Government's views and position on the matter, or will it, as in the case of other measures that we have considered recently, take the opposite view and vote against the position that the UK Government want to agree?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that as a Tory Member of Parliament the hon. Gentleman will understand the dangers and lack of common sense in trying to express a uniform view on behalf of colleagues in the European Parliament. They have a job to do, and they will no doubt approach their responsibilities seriously. I do not suggest that they will take exactly the same line as me on everything, but I am sure that they will be guided by the same imperatives of ensuring the competitiveness of British business and not imposing unreasonable or unrealistic burdens on industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three UK members on the conciliation committee. Two are Labour, and one is Tory. I am sure that we shall all try to achieve consistency in the approaches to such matters, but I cannot speak for the Labour members of the conciliation committee any more than the hon. Gentleman can speak authoritatively for the Tory member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 6 of the document includes several percentages for the amount of material to be recovered. Those are percentages by weight of that which is being disposed of. The percentages are quite specific, and targets have to be hit within 46 months of the directive coming into force. How were those percentages arrived at? Were they just plucked out of the air? Are they aspirations, or has some research been done to show that they are practical?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend's question is rhetorical. The suggestion that the figures may have been plucked out of the air is not plausible. Obviously, there are different components and different levels of components in every device and gadget. Learned persons assessing the content of each have come up with the figures. We are opposed to the Parliament's suggestion that we should have an across the board increase—a 10 per cent. increase, for example. That sounds like trying to take the moral high ground. Whatever figure is set, whether by plucking one out of the air or by careful calculation, the Parliament would add 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are based on the experience of other member states and on what is achievable. We are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
negotiating to ensure that there is a proper balance between costs and benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to my previous question to the Minister, I accept that it is probably unreasonable to ask him to predict how people will behave in terms of voting, but can he tell the Committee how they have behaved in the past? In relation to the four areas that he mentioned, what happened when the Parliament amended the text in a way that the Government did not support? That is important because the Government are saying that a United Kingdom interest is at stake. They are representing their position as being the proper one to take to defend that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt Labour Members of the European Parliament would also say that they are representing and defending legitimate interests. It is important for the Committee to know whether the two groups—the Government and Labour Members of the European Parliament—are aligned on the particular amendments to which the Minister referred, or at loggerheads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the last point, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am not at loggerheads with anyone—as far as I am aware. I do not wish to be pedantic about the matter, but I am here to represent the Government rather than a party political position. I made the point that we would look for the party's support—we would look for the support of all parties in the European Parliament. I will not, however, get into a debate about how specific Members voted or what positions they took. We must ensure that our views prevail as far as possible through the conciliation committee. The hon. Gentleman made a perfectly legitimate debating point, but it is not one that I will be drawn into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press my hon. Friend a little more on the issue of recovery? I am concerned that we do some positive good for the environment, should we go down the route described. The figures in article 6 are around 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. by weight of the material that is disposed. However, when the waste includes a computer, the percentages could be achieved by recovering the power supply in the case. All the inside gubbins—the bits that we really want to be recycled—could go into landfill sites and the target would still be met simply because they are lighter than other components. I press the Minister to see how we are working on the percentages and whether we intend to refine the guidelines to ensure that we recover the components that should be recycled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aims are more specific than that; it is not simply an across the board measurement by waste. The type of device that that my hon. Friend describes would be a way of circumventing the intention of the directive. That would simply not be available. It will be clear which components within each piece of equipment will have to be recycled. The imperative to recycle is not new and does not come from this directive. Computers are a good example of that. The bits inside computers to which my hon. Friend referred are by and large recovered anyway
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
because they have an intrinsic value. Targets must be simple, but common sense in addition to targets and vested interests in recovering valuable components from equipment will counter his concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Liberal Democrats have not turned up, the rest of us are forced to be pedantic. On that note, may I draw the Minister's attention to annex IV of the directive, in which there is a picture of a wheelie bin? Is the wheelie bin sign nation-specific? My experience is that wheelie bins are not ubiquitous in Europe, and I would hate our businesses to be placed at a competitive disadvantage because we were warned against disposing equipment in wheelie bins while other countries were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even taking account of the fact that the hon. Gentleman was compensating for the absence of Liberal Democrat Members, that was a poor effort. I was worried that there might not be a civil servant who is specifically committed to the subject of wheelie bins, but my concern has been relieved because I have received a message. The wheelie bin symbol will be used throughout the European Union. There might be a pan-European name other than wheelie bin, but I shall come back to the hon. Gentleman if I receive further intelligence on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that one of the parts of the current common position text to which the Government object is the mandatory separation of waste at the household disposal point. May I probe the Minister on that, bearing in mind the question asked by the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)? If the Government resist the mandatory imposition of separation at the household disposal point, will they be able to achieve the recovered weight per household that is required by the directive by addressing only streams of waste that are already separated from normal household waste? A large proportion of electrical and electronic equipment in the UK is disposed by specific collection or by being taken to civic amenity points, rather than put in the wheelie bin. Do the Government believe that as long as the directive does not impose mandatory separation, the UK will hit its targets without addressing the waste stream that goes into the wheelie bin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a way, the surprising thing is that we do relatively well on waste separation already. That is a personal observation because I do not think that we are particularly good at separating waste, so I am surprised that we already exceed the target. The target is 4 kg per head of separation, and we already collect 8 kg per head. Meeting targets is not a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty of enforced separation is that it increases costs significantly. The intention is not to impose a huge financial burden on local authorities or the taxpayer and, therefore, we do not think that enforced separation is desirable. However, separation is desirable, and we should use carrots as opposed to sticks to increase environmental awareness and people's interest in separating rubbish. We do not want to go down the road of using the directive as a device for enforcing separation, particularly given our relatively successful record on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that, provided that the Government are successful in arguing against mandatory separation, the imposition of the directive will make no difference to the behaviour that the UK consumer has to undertake, so that the waste that they habitually put into their wheelie bins will still get taken away, and the required targets will be met by virtue of the other collection arrangements, which typically relate to larger household electrical goods?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware that local authority practice varies considerably in relation to the collection of waste electrical and electronic equipment? At one end of the spectrum, there are local authorities that collect without charge and on demand. At the other, there are local authorities that do not collect at all. In between, there are local authorities that operate a range of charging regimes. Does the Minister have any plans— as a direct result of this directive, or otherwise—to achieve any kind of standardisation of collection practice by local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Standardisation is not the appropriate word, but we should encourage local authorities to encourage best practice, in this as in everything else. It would be in keeping with the spirit of the directive if there were arrangements in place to collect the kind of equipment that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To hon. Gentleman also asked whether anything will change. In a purely technical sense, nothing will change. However, the whole point of the directive would be lost if nothing changed in practice. Writing laws is not the only way of achieving better behaviour from us. I hope that the mere existence of a directive of this kind—and the interest that it attracts and the messages that it sends out—will lead to changes in behaviour. It is not a good idea for people to throw their hairdryers, or old clocks with batteries in them, into the bin, freely or otherwise, and I hope that that behaviour will change, but I do not want to write a law that says that it must change. That is not inherent in the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not want to send out the message that we do not expect anything to change. It is desirable on environmental grounds that some of our behaviour should change. The point of having a directive of this kind is to enforce a minimum standard. Fortunately, we already meet the standard that this directive sets, and we do not want to interfere with individuals' behaviour to the extent that it becomes oppressive or expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugo Swire 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tease a little more out of the Minister on local authorities' reactions to the directive? We all know the history of the problems over domestic refrigeration units: the £6 million that was allocated to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to help local authorities was woefully inadequate, and the problems quickly became acute in my county of Devon. Given that the Minister does not wish to standardise, what incentives will he give to local authorities to encourage them to comply? How will encouraging domestic households to take on board more of the directive positively and negatively affect local authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities will be free to determine how they respond to the directive. It does not directly impose requirements or costs on local authorities, but we are consulting with them: DEFRA and the DTI are involved with them in a discussion group that meets regularly to identify and to address their concerns. They establish how they could work together with retailers and producers to fulfil the collection requirement of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are already obliged under the waste strategy to meet recycling targets, and the WEEE directive will be another incentive—or imperative—encouraging them to raise their levels of recycling. We understand local authorities' concerns about collection-site space and licensing constraints, for example, and we are working with them to try to resolve those issues. A constructive and realistic approach has been taken. The approach has been to co-ordinate a response, and to co-operate in addressing quite legitimate concerns and problems. However, local authorities have no objection to the principle of the directive, much of which they are already obliged to respond to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to my previous answer. I should also have said that we are talking about changes in consumer behaviour. An important point is that retailers will be obliged to take back equipment that they have sold. Once that becomes a familiar part of the scene and consumers are responding to it, retailers will be obliged either to take equipment back directly or to nominate a third party to whom it can be returned. If we are going to say to people: "We don't want you to put your hairdryers, clocks or radios in the bin," we will have to tell them what else they can do with them—in the nicest possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of making sure that funding is available for recovering items, in the documents, five options are given for how the money could be raised. They include collective financing by producers; a visible fee when goods are bought; individual financing by producers; tradeable permanents; and a deposit refund system. At some point, the Government will have to decide which of the options they prefer. Can the Minister say when that is likely to happen, and what sort of consultation we will have about it? Will he also give his feelings about which of the options the other members of the European Union prefer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the time scale, we expect the collective provision to be established by autumn this year. It will be 18 months before it is implemented, so there is a lot of time in which to get down to the nitty-gritty of how the directive is to be implemented. We cannot tell how financing will work in the UK until we have the final text. The draft directive is complex and a plethora of amendments have been tabled to it. Most schemes in other member states are financed through collective systems. We will consider those systems alongside the alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some member states use a visible fee system, whereby consumers pay a levy on the price of a new product to pay for recycling. There are drawbacks to that, too, not least because under that system it will be difficult to impose the differential costs that will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
eventually arise in relation to every piece of equipment. Deposit systems can encourage take-back, but—to reduce the argument to something with which many are familiar—how many people take back their lemonade bottles because of the deposit? How many would take back their radios, clocks or hairdryers because they paid a couple of quid extra a few years previously? That is a moot point. In any case, in a more inflationary period the value of the deposit would diminish in the lifetime of the product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are all options and they are all being considered. Not one jumps out as being by far the best, simplest and most effective. My hon. Friend is right. All of us must find a way to proceed during the months ahead. All options, particularly as they apply to existing schemes, are being examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is critical that we examine how costs will be passed on, particularly if they will be passed on to the consumer, because we are discussing some high-expenditure items. We know that products can be cheaper abroad: people take booze cruises to Calais to fill up cars and other vehicles with cheaper alcohol. If we pass the costs directly to the consumer, who is to say that people will not make fridge runs to Calais? Will the Minister reflect on one particular point? Irrespective of the way in which he thinks that we should pass costs on, we must not render our smaller retailers uncompetitive with their European counterparts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes his own point, and I do not dissent. If we created a cost disadvantage, people might go elsewhere to buy the products. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I hear my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet refer to Ramsgate, but I am not sure about the context—perhaps he will deal with that in a moment. It is important to get things right and to ensure that British companies are not rendered uncompetitive or disadvantaged by the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost mechanism that is determined and recommended will be subject to widespread consultation before it is finalised. The hon. Gentleman's point will remain at the forefront of our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I answer the Minister's rhetorical question, "Who takes back their hairdryer because they have paid a couple of quid more for it?" Until Monday, I would have suggested that the Chancellor was such a person. I heard what he said on Monday afternoon and I am not sure whether he is quite as prudent as he used to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I pick up on the Minister's theme in response to questions on finance, I shall return to the issue of separate collection. The Minister rightly said that he would not like anybody to take the message from this debate that nothing will change for consumers. That is clearly not the intention behind the directive. Let us explore what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister said that consumers will have many small products around their homes, such as alarm clocks and small hand-held electronic games— people freely buy and dispose of such items these
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
days—which will be marked with the sign of a wheelie bin with a cross though it. People will know that such items should not be included with ordinary household waste. Will the Minister confirm that putting such items into the waste will not be a criminal offence, and that the sign will be used for guidance rather than as a sanction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not realistic to think that, if a responsible householder wanted to respond to the directive's spirit, he would look at his alarm clock to find out where it was made and from where he bought it, and get in his car on a Saturday morning to hand it in for proper recycling. Indeed, that action would probably be an environmental disaster, and we should not encourage it. A beneficial change in behaviour will occur only if local authorities start separate collections of electrical and electronic equipment waste that the householder separates voluntarily. Does the Minister envisage a blue bag scheme in which local authorities will be required to remove and to process separately the WEEE stream that householders choose to separate, but cannot, or will not, return personally to the producer for disposal due to practical considerations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. There is no intention of creating an offence, and there is no intention to prescribe additional duties for local authorities. Obviously, we intend to improve behaviour and our recycling record, which is already above the target on which the directive is founded. Given that fact, any other action that we take will be extra, and that puts into perspective some of the wilder scare stories about the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right. If I had bought an alarm clock in Glasgow, I would not travel from London to take it back to the shop. In fact, I may have to go to Glasgow anyway, so I could take it with me, so that was a bad example to cite. People will not necessarily return to the point of purchase. However, given that a high proportion of goods will be accounted for by retailers that operate on a multiple basis and are distributed throughout the country, some problems could be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that much recycling will take place through the provision of central sites by local authorities. They are undertaking a lot of work already and could do it more effectively in response to the directive, the costs of which can be contained within the scheme. I want to play down the significance of the proposal. It is important environmentally. It builds on much of what takes place at present. The directive starts from a healthy position because we already meet the targets, but it will be good universally if we can do better in a non-prescriptive, non-bureaucratic way, with no additional costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with all the sentiments expressed by the Minister, but it causes me concern that he is proposing to go forward with the directive without giving any real thought to how local authorities will cope with it. It will be up to local authorities to take such action. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is right. Even if people remember which shop they bought their alarm clock from, it is ridiculous to suppose that they will mosey on down to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Dixons five years after the purchase. Despite saying that we are already giving such messages to people, the Government need to give thought to how local authorities will cope with the directive. If the Minister is serious about improving our already good performance, he needs to consider who will pay for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not my intention to say anything that could be caricatured. I want to set the record straight. I did not say that people will mosey on down to Dixons five years later to hand back their alarm clock. That is the sort of caricature that some people have a vested interest in applying to the directives. However, it would not be a bad thing if people did do that and perhaps a minority of them will. That would be one strand of a range of solutions. Dixons will not have such a responsibility, however, because it will be the responsibility of the producer. It may be in the interests of the retailer to offer such facilities. I am not saying that people will be expected to take such action and that alarm clock police will instruct them to take a note of where they buy the equipment, so that they can take it back five years later. That is not implied in the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As soon as the equipment is taken to a central site, producer responsibility will kick in and the costs that have been incurred will have to be met. We must remember that local authorities already have such sites and collect barrel-loads of electrical equipment. The proposal is not new. It is not as though equipment is all tipped into landfill at present, and that a great revolution will occur. Under the directive, we will see a gradation and an increase in the amount of equipment that will be separated and recycled. The facility to deal with it in an intelligent way, to recover part of its value and to be environmentally friendly will increase incrementally. Any costs that local authorities incur from carrying out these responsibilities will fall to the DTI, if they are a direct result of our legislation. It is not intended that there should be such extra costs; there is no reason why they should not be met by producer responsibility within the kind of scheme that will be drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point about competitiveness, everybody else will also have these responsibilities. They will apply across the EU. Other countries will have to come up with their own schemes, so it will not be as if French alarm clocks will be immune whereas ours will have to be taken back to Dixons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These costs are going to be a producer responsibility, but how will we enforce that responsibility on producers that are based outside the EU? Have there been any discussions at the World Trade Organisation about the fact that producers in, for example, the United States of America might say that it would be anti-competitive to impose that responsibility on them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good question. The answer to it is that the importers are considered to be the producers. I cannot say at present whether this matter has been discussed at the WTO. If my hon. Friend really wants to know about that, I will find out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that this will be a producer responsibility. I wish that I could believe that. I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison) that, at the end of the day, a lot of the additional expense will fall to the local authorities. Let us say that a producer company goes bankrupt. How can it be encouraged to pay anything, if one is working on a deposit basis? In the case of an intestate estate or a house clearance, will the local authority—or whoever is responsible—take the trouble to return all electrical goods and so forth? I suspect not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that some of the cost will accrue to the local authorities. When the Government come to agree what the additional funding to them should be, will they bear in mind how wide of the mark they were with regard to the funding that was provided to deal with the storage cost of fridges? DEFRA allocated £6 million, but Essex county council has estimated that the costs for it alone are £ 1.68 million, so there is a huge funding deficit. Will the Minister make a commitment that, if local authorities are to be compensated for these additional costs, compensation will be paid annually and will not be phased out after a while, thereby leaving the local taxpayer to pick up the difference once again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said. There should not be hypothetical costs that bear no relation to reality. There is a long history of local authorities suffering because of that. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not my intention to come up with a hypothetical figure. In the discussions with local authorities to which I have referred, that concern will be uppermost in their minds. Local authorities already carry a lot of burdens on behalf of central Government, and it would be unfair if we were to add to them without ensuring that they had the means to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that local authority costs resulting from the regulations that will, I presume, flow from this directive would be borne by the DTI. If a local authority were to decide to establish a scheme for collecting separated electronic and electrical waste from households, would the DTI bear the additional costs to the local authority? That is an important point. Unless local authorities are prepared to remove separated out waste free of charge from the household disposal point, it is difficult to see how the directive will make any impact. The Minister told the Committee that we are already over-achieving on the weight targets, so no pressure will be caused by the need to comply with the directive. Producers will be responsible for the cost of disposing of items that are harvested, so they will have no incentive to try to increase the amount of material that is recovered. This does not appear to me to be intuitive. Unless local authorities give out separate bags and say, "Please put your electronic and electrical waste in these and we will collect and process them," it does not seem that we will achieve anything substantial through the directive. I urge the Minister to consider giving financial incentives, such as the ability to recover costs from the DTI, to local authorities to operate such schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities already have an incentive: they set their own recycling targets. Local authorities that are good and ambitious set recycling targets that are substantially higher than they presently achieve. Many will go at the problem with a will. They will not do it only because central Government or Brussels is driving them with a big stick. They will do it because it is a virtuous and good thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will also have a financial incentive in the sense that, the more they separate and recycle and gain financial benefit from doing so, the less they will landfill. Landfill carries its own costs and burdens. That nobody will do anything about the problem unless it is made compulsory or exceptionally simple is an especially gloomy view of human behaviour. I agree that it may be desirable to make the task simpler than it is at present. However, we live in an era of increased awareness that recycling is good and socially responsible. I wish that I lived up to the ideal more consistently, but I always intend to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the suggestion that, if we made things a bit easier, many others and I would do more. Far from being a burden, this type of directive is a useful prod towards doing things that we all know we should do. I classify local authorities as being in the same camp as the rest of us. With encouragement and fair coverage of costs, they will do more and encourage us to do more as individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I understand it, my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is saying that people should be given incentive. In Devon, we have a superb record for recycling. I even recycle myself—I shall probably be recycled soon. Incentive should be given to the local authority and the householder. If both are given incentive and recycling is made easy for one to do and easy for the other to think about doing, we will get the results that we all want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What this debate tells us is that we all agree that recycling of electrical and electronic waste is a good and reasonable thing. Let us unite on that. I do not disagree with a word of what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned local authorities recycling and "gaining financial benefit from doing so". I wish to probe him on that. Is it the case that the producer's responsibility under the directive as drafted will begin when the goods arrive at a central collection point? Am I right in understanding that local authorities' collection costs will not be recoverable from producers? If so, it is not obvious how the local authority would gain financially from recycling except in the relatively limited cases in which products have a positive end of life value. Because of the nature of modern manufacturing, that would involve a relatively small number of products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a related point, will the Minister explain whether mandatory retailer take-back has been abandoned by all sides, or is there still an agenda in the Parliament or elsewhere advocating such a scheme? In the course of the debate, the Minister has implied
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
that that would not be the principal mode of recollection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that final point, retailers will have to offer to take back goods on a like-for-like basis, so they will have a role to play in take-back. However, it is not retailers but producers that will meet the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Gentleman's first question, producers must pay from the time that the items reach the central point. However, under present thinking, they will have the option to pay beforehand. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge looks startled; I feel another question coming on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that local authorities would have a financial benefit, but I think—we can check the record—that I said so specifically in the context of their savings on landfill. At the moment, they have to pay for landfill, but under the arrangements in the directive not only will there be less landfill, but the cost of the alternative to it would be met by producers. Therefore, there is a net financial benefit to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, the Minister said that producers would have an option to pay. I assume that he meant that member states would have the option to impose on producers an obligation to pay for collection, as well as reprocessing and disposal. Will he confirm that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I move on to the question of the small and medium enterprises exemption? I should like to establish the Government's position regarding that proposed exemption under the conciliation process. Will the Minister say whether the Government are arguing for a 30-month or a five-year derogation? Will he also confirm that the Government will implement the maximum possible derogation allowed under the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The common position text includes a derogation that was fought for by the UK, and which the hon. Gentleman therefore expects us to support. The derogation exempts manufacturers with fewer than 10 employees, or with a turnover of less than 2 million euros a year, from the financing obligations of producer responsibility for 30 months, starting from the publication of the directive. That is a reflection of our position. The derogation is time-limited to an additional two and a half years. That will allow for SME education, familiarisation and general catch-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament is pressing for that derogation to be removed, but we believe that it is essential, as SMEs are often cash-constrained and work with a limited knowledge base, and do not always have access to the resources of larger firms. For all those reasons, we stand by the derogation that we successfully pressed to be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain why Greece and Ireland have a special derogation, and will he say whether the UK objected to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I shall have to get back to the hon. Gentleman on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
and electronic equipment will, in some cases, be classed as hazardous waste? That would impose special requirements on those handling, storing and processing it, and could have significant effects on the procedures that we have been talking about. I hope that he will say something about what is happening on that front, because several industry representative bodies raised that concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are now discussing the ROHS directive, as well as the WEEE directive. The Government's vision is for the next 20 years, and we are determined to reduce waste and increase recycling, as is self-evident. Our recycling programme and waste and resources action programme initiatives will develop new markets and technologies to help to ensure that outlets are available for WEEE when recycled. The strategy sets recycling and composting targets for household waste of 25 per cent. by 2005, 30 per cent. by 2010, and 32 per cent. by 2015.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On hazardous waste, the collection and transport of most WEEE items does not fall under the Special Waste Regulations 1996, which cover hazardous waste. Most WEEE will not be classified as hazardous for those purposes until DEFRA has amended the regulations. That is in hand, and DEFRA will consult on the matter later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From 16 July—yesterday—some WEEE items may be disposed of only at a hazardous waste landfill site, as they count as hazardous for the purposes of the landfill directive. The waste management industry informs us that the hazardous waste landfill capacity is likely to be sufficient. Disposal costs may increase slightly, but the cost depends on the availability of disposal capacity, and if there is plenty of capacity, as we expect, costs will stay roughly the same. Reclassification is necessary to bring those items under the hazardous waste regulations, and that process is in hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, we have had a constructive exchange of views and questions. I have many questions that I have not been able to ask, and at the risk of seeming rather inelegant, I intend to conduct the debate by posing a series of further questions that I hope that the Minister can answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support the principle of recycling as part of an effort to reduce landfill and incineration requirements, especially of substances that may be hazardous. I say that with some feeling, as in my constituency, which is close to the River Thames and is in an area that has for many years been subject to substantial amounts of gravel extraction, there is a significant amount of
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
landfill activity, which gives rise to serious local concern.

My constituency contains an old landfill site, the result of what was known as the Egham experiment, when a brilliant Government scientist decided that it would be interesting to find out what would happen if we operated an uncontained landfill with no clay liner and tipped everything into it—industrial, commercial, hazardous and household waste—put the earth back on top and let nature do its work. We are now 40 years down the line and nature is still doing its work, leaching the contents of that pit into the gardens and past the homes of my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much aware of the long-term potential dangers of landfilling and that what might seem good practice today might, 30, 40 or 50 years down the line, seem the most cavalier and dangerous practice. Looking back, the Egham experiment pit now seems an extremely bad idea. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for South Thanet makes a party political point. He may know my constituency and that most— indeed, the overwhelming majority—of my local councillors are Conservative, but Egham and Thorpe, the two areas that are particularly affected by landfill, are almost uniquely not represented by Conservative councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three overarching questions sprang to mind when I considered the draft directives, the first of which was subsidiarity. The hazardous substances directive must be dealt with on a pan-European basis. It is a single market issue. There cannot be different rules about what can and cannot be included in products in different parts of the European Union. I hope that the Minister can confirm that the Government will be robust in insisting that there is a separate legal base for the two directives: that the hazardous substances directive is based firmly in, I think, article 75, the single market article, and the electrical and electronic equipment directive is based in the environmental article. Although the Minister said that it was important to create a level playing field, it is not obvious to me that it is necessary to have a European directive on disposal practice. Can he explain in a little more detail what led him to conclude that it was necessary to have such a measure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question concerns the practicality of the directive. We have explored some matters this morning and I am reassured by what the Minister said. I do not think that, in reality, we shall see a significant change in household practice in respect of small electrical waste equipment, unless local authorities become proactively involved. If they offer households separate bags to store waste electrical and electronic equipment, I am sure that many will make use of them. If local authorities install systems and the equipment separately to process the waste streams, we may see some differences. However, I do not imagine that significant numbers of people will take their waste electronic and electrical equipment to central disposal points. As for the disposal smaller items, that will depend on whether doorstep collection can be organised by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, let us consider proportionality. It would be a massive own goal if people made special car
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
journeys. We have all seen people pulling up in their cars on street corners and hurling a couple of wine bottles into the recycling bins, then going home, to open another bottle no doubt, feeling comfortable that they have done their bit for the environment—having made a round trip of three or four miles in their 12 miles to the gallon car. Overall, almost all glass recycling that is delivered by car has an environmentally negative effect. It is important that we take into account the overall environmental costs and benefits of such measures. It is not immediately clear to me, nor was it to the European Scrutiny Committee, that the benefits will outweigh the costs or that work has been done properly to establish the costs and benefits. The presentation of the likely costs and benefits to the United Kingdom was a crude disaggregation of the European Union costs and benefits, which, in turn, were produced in a not particularly rigorous way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the debate in Brussels about environmental issues, we sometimes get the impression that there is a significant element there who think that any measure delivering environmental benefit is good, full stop, and that cost-benefit analysis need not be carried out rigorously. I am glad to say that the UK approach— this is not a party political issue—is more rigorous in demanding that we do only those things that produce clear net benefit in environmental terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is correct to put the point in quite that way, but costs and benefits are important. I simply said that I suspect that the act of delivering glass to the recycling point by car means that no net environmental benefit will be produced. Obviously, such issues are complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a finite amount of financial resources available to deal with recycling and environmental problems. Many of the people who promote so-called environmental solutions sometimes do not want to talk about the financial costs and benefits. Given that we have a finite amount of wealth that we are prepared to devote to improving the environment, I would like a more rigorous approach in which we say, "Let us use the money that is available. Let us take the hit that we are prepared to take in the most beneficial way so that we achieve the largest possible environmental benefit for every pound spent."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify a point that he touched on during questions in relation to where producer responsibility commences? If I have correctly interpreted what he said, there will be a mandatory requirement for producers to be responsible for the costs from a central collection point and member states will be able to impose costs on producers further upstream—the cost of local authority collection, for example. If that is so, will the Minister define "central collection point"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Clearly, there will be a significant difference in the burden of cost imposed on producers depending on whether the central collection point is the local recycling centre in each community or the regional centre to which local authorities deliver their waste. Or does it mean the designated receiving centre for each producer, where the designated agent will deliver the waste for which the producer is responsible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities are to play a constructive role in the process, does the Minister accept that the capacity of local authority contractors will need to be significantly increased to handle and process the amount of waste?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm that the Government are seeking a minimally bureaucratic system, and that we will not get into the same red tape nightmare that we have with packaging waste and the producer responsibility note system, in which the cost of the effort of doing the thing almost certainly outweighs the benefit delivered? Or will the Minister opt for a market-oriented situation in which we have the minimum amount of bureaucratic involvement to meet the end objective? Does he recognise that there is not a single electronic and electrical equipment industry, but that different subsectors of the industry that make different products face many different situations? It would be inappropriate to allow a single regime to apply across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can reassure the Committee that the directive will have sufficient scope for different interpretations and regimes to be imposed on different parts of the industry, as appropriate to the situation in the United Kingdom. Will he assure us that the Government intend to recognise the wide range of goods covered by the directive and the wide range of collection and recovery mechanisms that will be appropriate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister about the Greek and Irish derogation. He was not able to answer at the time, but inspiration might have arrived by the time that he responds to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate that the Minister will say something about the UK's state of readiness to deal with the directive. We already reprocess a substantial amount of electrical and electronic equipment waste, but if the directive is to have a positive effect, the amount should increase. The Minister says that the situation is not like the fridges fiasco because we have reprocessing capability. It would be good to have an assurance of that on the record, if only so that I can wave it at him when, and if, a polychlorinated biphenyl—PCB— mountain arrives in my, or anyone else's, constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain further how the proposed regime will affect medical equipment and medical electronic products? I was involved in that field for many years before I came to the House, so it is— unusually—something that I might know a little about. I believe that contaminated products will be excluded from the recovery regime. That is significant because medical practice is moving toward using more disposable products, although the UK has lagged behind many of our EU partners in moving from reusable to disposable products. Significant numbers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
of medical electronic disposable products are used every year and they cause much waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One figure springs to mind. In 1990, I estimated that the European Union was using between 300 and 400 million disposable cardiac electrodes each year. I assume that they would be classed as bio-contaminated waste because they have been in contact with patients' skin, although they are not used invasively, and that such products would be excluded from the scope of the directive and would continue to be disposed of in landfill or, more likely, by incineration as moderately contaminated waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain how the regime on medical electronic products will work? Has an estimate been made of the cost to the national health service of compliance with the spirit of the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman's local Conservative council decides to build an incinerator in the working-class parts of his constituency alongside the landfill site that it has already dumped there, one of his constituents' worries will be the production of dioxins from the incinerator. The components about which he talked are made of such things as copper, which is a catalyst when burned. Does he agree that if the equipment is incinerated, it will produce dioxins? Whether or not we include such equipment in the directive, we must find a mechanism to get them out of the incineration stream.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. His knowledge of the machinations of local government is not perfect; if he thinks about it he will realise that county councils are responsible for waste disposal and decisions about incinerators. He may not be aware that that is a live issue in Surrey, where the construction of an incinerator is actively being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that there is a great deal of public concern about incineration—some of it, I suspect, misplaced. Some years ago, I visited an incinerator close to the airport in Toronto. Canada has extremely tight environmental laws, and the incinerator operated under a good system. It gave an online analysis of the emissions, and had a display screen in the city hall in downtown Toronto. Any concerned citizen could go in and see, on a real-time basis, what the incinerator was chucking out. I understand that that led to a lessening of public concern about such issues. However, the hon. Gentleman is right that there is a debate to be had about the safety of incineration, and that we must reassure the public about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On an important matter of policy, the Minister said that the UK was battling for the flexibility to adopt common responsibility for the cost of recovery and reprocessing, rather than individual producer responsibility for own products. The European Parliament has sought to mandate that individual producers should be responsible for their products only. The thinking behind that, which seems logical to me, is that only then do we give individual producers an incentive to design easy-to-recycle, environmentally friendly products. If we lump together the good, the bad and the ugly and average out the cost, we remove
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
any incentive for good practice in a fragmented and diverse industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that the UK's preference is for a collective cost-sharing approach, I should like him to explain why he thinks that that will deliver maximum environmental benefit. A major international electronics company based in my constituency has expressed the clear view that that would be a negative factor for environmentally responsible companies such as itself. It strongly advocates, as do several of the industry associations, that the Government consider a product-specific or manufacturer-specific system of cost responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister about securities for future costs of disposals. My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire) mentioned orphan products, which arise when the original producer— or, more likely, a relatively insubstantial original importer—goes out of business or has disappeared by the time that the product comes to be recycled. Several options have been considered, including bonds for future costs and blocked cash accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, when wearing one of his other hats, is responsible for oil and gas in the North sea. He knows that security for decommissioning costs—a similar sort of issue—is a major topic in respect of the North sea. Such costs affect small and large companies differently, and I suspect that that will also be true for the waste electrical and electronic equipment issue. Large companies will probably be able to carry the burden on their balance sheet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Large companies will not find it particularly expensive or onerous if the Government insist on bonds being put in place or letters of credit being raised, because the strength of their balance sheet makes the risk taken on by the institution that provides the bond or the letter of credit relatively small. It will be a very significant burden to small companies. Has the Minister made a detailed appraisal of the likely impacts on companies of different sizes of the different methodologies that are proposed for providing security for costs? Of all the aspects of the directive, this one will probably do the most damage to small and medium enterprises, and it may be too much of a burden for some companies—the cost will be too much for their balance sheet to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the current version of the text makes all producers collectively responsible for orphan waste. That is a pragmatic way of proceeding, but it is also questionable. It would be more appropriate if the state were to accept responsibility for orphan waste—waste for which there is no security in place for disposal costs. Those costs should be borne by taxpayers in general, rather than by responsible manufacturers who have put in place the necessary bonding and are dealing with their own products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the terms of the final directive permit them to do so, will the British Government allow the imposition of a visible fee in respect of the cost of dealing with the historic workstation for electronic computer equipments—I am unsure what else to call it, as we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
referred to the historic car park for vehicles when the end of life vehicles directive was discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the role of refurbishment for resale in the overall process of dealing with electronic and electrical equipment waste. On the face of it, the most attractive way to recycle this kind of waste is for it to be refurbished and reused. I walked to the Committee with the hon. Member for South Thanet, and on the way I mentioned to him an organisation in my constituency—the Whip is on to that. I am sure that there are such organisations in many other hon. Member's constituencies. It collects computers from businesses, which typically dispose of them on a two-year cycle. It then refurbishes them, and upgrades them if that is necessary, and distributes them free of charge to schools and charities. It has been very successful, because it has managed to persuade many businesses not only to give them their computers, but to give them money to upgrade, clean and recycle them. That is a useful initiative, because it gives those computers a further two or three years of useful life—and at the end of that period, the same companies will be getting ready to throw out another set of computers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much electrical and electronic equipment— particularly household white goods—is refurbished and exported abroad. Sometimes it is not refurbished; it is just exported for reuse in third world countries, or in eastern Europe. Is the Minister concerned that the export of such equipment creates a potential loophole in the reprocessing procedures and obligations? If a piece of equipment is exported from the EU at the end of its useful EU life, in most cases it will subsequently not be reprocessed or subject to the kind of recovery procedures that we have been talking about. It will slip through the net. Is that a worry for the Government? Shall we be exporting a problem? Is the Minister bothered that there may be a loophole? Does he not see the possibility that unscrupulous operators would purport to export products that were, in fact, being removed outside the European Union for dumping? That is not a new problem, but it may be exacerbated by the directive. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is listening to me because I shall want specific answers to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there a loophole, and are there any plans to close it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the hon. Gentleman confirm whether there are plans to create a separate regime for the recycling of business waste electronic and electrical equipment as distinct from household waste? One of the documents that I read last night suggested that businesses would be in a different position when purchasing electronic and electrical equipment, and that there would be an option for the producer and the purchaser to agree a different sharing of responsibility for the ultimate disposal costs. Do the Government intend to set up a regime that recognises the different status of the buyer? Is that their understanding of the directive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Finally, has the Department carried out an assessment of the likely impact of the WEEE directive on the roll-out of new technology? Is it the Government's view that it will slow up the rate of replacement of equipment? Is not there a danger that that will, in turn, slow up the rate of introduction of new technology, whether it is the latest generation mobile phones or the latest generation of computer equipment? We know from work done in the United States of America that the speed of introduction of new technology into the workplace, especially IT, is a significant factor in determining productivity growth rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Chancellor's principal targets is to improve the United Kingdom's productivity growth and, God knows, he will need that to happen if he is to get near hitting the growth figures for the UK economy over the next three years on which he has based his spending programmes. Is the Minister not worried that a perverse, unintended consequence of the directive may slow up the deployment of new technology and thus make UK business marginally less competitive in comparison with its USA counterpart? That counterpart is more significant to UK business than it is to most of our European Union partner businesses because we have a larger trade with the United States than with any of our European Union partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn briefly to the hazardous substances directive. I have already asked the Minister to confirm that the Government will defend rigorously the use of the separate legal base and resist moves that have been made by other member states to have the hazardous waste directive introduced under the article 175 base, not the article 95 base. Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Government will argue for a single harmonised date for the introduction of the hazardous substances directive rules and that the date for the UK will be the latest permitted by the directive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Thanet has already asked about the availability of alternative materials. Perhaps the Minister would touch on that. Will there be any derogations? For example, will products that involve hazardous substances be permitted in military applications, even though they would not be permitted in civilian applications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I express my appreciation to members of the Committee, especially those who have spoken, for the manner in which the discussion has unfolded? Such measures are vulnerable to caricature and to misrepresentation, particularly when "Europe" is involved. The directives are sensible and potentially beneficial measures. They will lead to an incremental increase in the recycling of products that should be recycled rather than dumped in the ground for a distant, future generation to deal with. As long as the manner and method of implementation is as sensible as the objective, the directives will lead not to problems, but to significant environmental benefit and economic opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's approach to the directives is a reflection of the consensus on such issues. I certainly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
welcome the range of questions that I have been asked, particularly those by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, and I shall answer them seriously. I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman on those questions that I do not deal with today. It is important for me to stress at the outset that many questions fall into the category of "I don't know the answer yet", because consultation is ongoing. Part of the purpose of the debate, at the instigation of the European Scrutiny Committee, is to elucidate the thinking behind the directives and justify them. I hope that both the spirit and the detail of our discussion will contribute to that objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WEEE directive seeks to deliver significant environmental benefits. One of the hon. Gentleman's early questions was whether we need an EU directive to do that. It helps to have a directive, not least because the measure would apply to the whole of the European Union so the relative competitive issues would not arise in the same way. Concerted action is good, but it is also important to stress that it will not be an imposition because the directive is in line with the UK's national waste strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the potential benefits of the directive? It is not a case of taking figures that have either been plucked out of the air or provided by the European Union. We have undertaken research and have commissioned additional work from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which demonstrates that greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from the disposal of electrical items should improve by between 10 and 50 per cent. under the WEEE directive compared with current UK practice. That is not an insignificant benefit. We must try to maximise it and ensure that it is at the 50 per cent. end of the scale, not the 10 per cent. end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK already collects nearly 50 per cent. of household WEEE items by weight, most of which are large white goods. Many of them already enter a recycling process. As I said earlier, the directive does not deal with rocket science or other great innovations. Many local authorities carry out the practice of recycling very well, but what should arise from the directive is an incremental improvement in our performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness to local authorities, it is important to emphasise that they are not reluctant partners in the process. They probably put a lot more thought on a daily basis into such issues than Parliament does. They are closer to the implementation of that kind of activity in their communities, and therefore want to improve their performance as part of the general service that they give to their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several EU member states, including the Netherlands and Sweden, already have similar legislation, and it works. The directives are not a dramatic innovation; other countries are already doing things of the type mentioned in the directive, and there is no reason why we cannot do them. We should be learning from their experiences as well as ours. We should regard the implementation as well worth doing, and we should go for it in a credible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
We also know, from the experiences of other countries, something of the costs involved. As a result of such legislation, the average price of consumer goods in the Netherlands rose by 1 per cent., not the 10 to 15 per cent. claimed by some lobby groups in the UK. I also stress that the directive creates big opportunities for the waste management industry. I shall later say more about the potential for innovation and doing things better, and how that is an economic good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is big, and will be even bigger if we take what we are doing with electrical goods in conjunction with end of life vehicles and all the other recycling measures that are coming through. If the opportunities are taken, they can produce many jobs. Even the much-reviled fridges will be an employment creator once the infrastructure for dealing with them is in place. The environmental benefit of that infrastructure is beginning to come through. There is a proposal for such infrastructure in my constituency, so I am particularly aware of it. The measures will produce new or expanded industries, and that is another benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ROHS directive has been the poor relation in the debate; we have concentrated on the WEEE directive, and the ROHS directive has been WEEE's wee brother. It is worth noting that, under the ROHS directive, from 2007 the following materials and components of electrical equipment will be banned: lead, cadmium, hexavalent chromium—an anti-corrosive—mercury, and two brominated flame-retardants. All sorts of nasty things that go into household items will be banned under the directive, and that will be an incentive for producers to think harder, and in a more environmentally friendly way, about the materials and substances that they use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about subsidiarity. The WEEE directive allows considerable subsidiarity, but environmental impacts—air pollution, and so on—are cross-boundary. The WEEE directive makes all producers responsible, so it also has some single-market elements. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the two directives come under different powers. The ROHS directive comes under article 95, which refers to the single market, and the WEEE directive under article 175, which is on the environment. It is agreed by all that that is the basis on which we should proceed, so I reassure the hon. Gentleman on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is a bit too pessimistic. We must not discourage people from taking their bottles to be recycled by telling them that there is no point. There was a recent story about people on the Isle of Skye—with which I am quite familiar—who loyally took their bottles and so on to be recycled, put them into different slots, and were somewhat disappointed to find that the whole lot was then solemnly removed and put into landfill. I hope that that is a minority experience rather than a common one. By and large, people who recycle and separate their waste are doing a public service, and we should encourage them to do so as widely as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about Greece and Ireland. As he predicted, intelligence has reached me about the matter. Greece and Ireland have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
derogation that means that they do not have to meet the 4 kg collection target. I understand that we endorsed that agreement on the basis that they simply did not have the infrastructure to meet the targets within the time scale, especially because of the country's sparse population in rural areas. It is not an indefinite derogation, and neither should it be. There are parts of the UK that are as sparsely populated as rural Ireland or rural Greece. There may be a case for a temporary derogation on the basis of existing infrastructure, but it should not become permanent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to avoid the issue, because I regard the target as a good thing. In a positive way, I am making the point that other countries should also regard it as a good thing and that the derogation should be temporary. The hon. Gentleman says that I walked into it but I offer a more positive view. I am open about recognising a reality. We will have particular challenges in our sparsely populated areas, but we choose to accept rather than resist them. Therefore, we are better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not opposed to the principle of individual producer responsibilities but want to examine various options, especially to safeguard the interests of SMEs. We are happy to discuss such responsibilities if that is what large firms want instead of a collector system. However, the large firms generally have a large market share. Even with a collector system, they will incur the lion's share of the costs. It is not right to say that the large firms would have no interest in improving their own standards because it would all be buried within the one pool. Because they would occupy a large part of that pool, there would still be an advantage in improving their standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister says, but I am disappointed that he is not seizing the idea that environmentally friendly design could become a cost competitive advantage for a producer.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dismiss that point, but there are arguments both ways. I am happy for further discussion to take place between my officials and companies to get the balance right, but the hon. Gentleman's point is perfectly fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's question, "How do you define 'central collection point'?" was a good one. My initial reaction was to reply, "It's a point of central collection." However, he went on to ask where it might be. In rural areas especially, that is a good question. Is it in the village, the island or the county? The answer is that the question will form part of the consultation, and the issue has risen to prominence in my own mind as a result of the hon. Gentleman raising it. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
existing distribution of local authority sites would be a good starting point but not a definitive finishing point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that packaging can always improve but point out that the UK has the lowest cost compliance in the EU. For example, Germany's is 10 times higher. We cannot rule out any options at this stage. We can be flexible on implementation, and it may be appropriate to have different approaches for different sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about medical products. Contaminated products will not be excluded, but they will need separate handling. No recovery or recycling target has been set for those products at the outset. The feeling is that we must assess the impact, and targets will then be agreed by Committee process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disposable electrodes are not covered; the equipment is covered, but the consumables are not. There have been discussions with the NHS procurement agency, but costs cannot be meaningfully assessed until the terms of implementation have been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Orphan products is an area of negotiation between the European Parliament and the Council. Sharing costs is only one of the options; an upfront visible or invisible fee would address the problem in a different way. Fees could be visible only if the final text were to allow that. If it is allowed, it will be carefully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliament and the Council are looking at the wording of the directive to ensure that equipment that is exported outside the EU only goes to facilities that have similar requirements placed upon them. I have been told that that is the current policy with regard to packaging, and that the Environment Agency has visited sites in China.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming on to refurbishment for reuse and resale, but if the hon. Gentleman wants clarification on the export of refurbished items I will ensure that he receives it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We strongly support refurbishment for reuse and resale, but there are no targets for that in the directive. Information about the subject must be collected, with a view to setting a target when enough is known about it. We are working with the community sector to establish national standards for refurbishment and to ensure that issues such as energy consumption are considered before an appliance is reused. The DTI provides part-funding for that. The hon. Gentleman is right that refurbishment for reuse or resale is a valuable activity in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fears about innovation are misplaced. The directive will not inhibit innovation and economic activity—in fact, the opposite will be the case. Recycling requires innovative solutions and the

better use of materials, and it enhances resource productivity. All of that will be encouraged by this directive, and by the other measures that are currently being prepared. Growth will be stimulated in a useful and environmentally friendly sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Lady man</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. He is right that these directives will stimulate innovation. However, I have not seen anything in them that will allow manufacturers to reduce their ultimate costs, and therefore to gain a competitive advantage by going to the next step by producing goods that are entirely recyclable, or more easy to recycle. The negative impact of these directives cannot be reduced. However, might it be possible to introduce some positive benefits to manufacturers as we take these directives through to the final stages of agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have recognised the importance of innovation and research and development in a broad range of ways; there are tax credits for SMEs and large companies, as well as a host of other policy measures that are aimed at stimulating innovation. I am unsure whether extra measures are required for this sector, but I am prepared to listen to suggestions.

On the introduction of ROHS, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about a single date. We would prefer a single date for the ban to commence in all member states, but that would cause problems for countries that already have legislation in place. However, discussions about that are ongoing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked about military materials. Arms are exempt. They are not one of the 10 categories in the WEEE directive, but PCs and office equipment—non-military items that the military use— are covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's use of the word "finally" alerts me to the fact that, unless I missed it in his long and comprehensive series of answers, he has not answered the question about security for costs and the discriminatory effect of being required to post security on SMEs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to come back to the hon. Gentleman on that. I am sorry, but I do not have the answer immediately. I make that offer freely. I would not claim that I have given a comprehensive list of responses, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging that I have tried to answer as many questions as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quit while I may be marginally ahead. I thank the Committee for the spirit in which the matter has been discussed. I commend the way in which we are dealing with the matter to the Committee on the basis of a genuine assurance that everything that has been said today and all the questions that have been asked will be taken seriously and will feed into the continuing process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
