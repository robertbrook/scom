	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Skeffington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 31, line 21, to leave out paragraph (
	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the fact that I spoke at such length on the last occasion I shall deal with this matter very briefly. The right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens) asked in the Second Reading debate why Part II of the Bill did not apply in the case of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2736</span>
a block of flats where an office in part of the block is used for conducting the business of letting the flats and dealing with all the problems that arise in connection with it. I should have thought that these were business premises, just as any others and it seems unreasonable that they should be excluded. There may be some reason which is not apparent to me, but I should like to have some explanation of the matter, or to see if the Government are prepared to include the type of business referred to in paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) and to give it the benefit of Part II of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Patrick Spens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to this paragraph, in an intervention, in the Second Reading debate, but I did so because of the doubts which I feel about its effect on the businesses of carrying on boarding houses, private hotels and so forth, where the lessee lives on the premises and is dependent on the business carried on there. There are literally hundreds of this type of house in South Kensington. Many are large Victorian houses, leased by very worthy lessees, who are most useful in providing accommodation for people requiring it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases the name of the lessee is not known to the people desiring to occupy the premises for a short or long term. It is nearly always a question of merely knowing the number of the house and the name of the street. I should like to give a short personal anecdote to illustrate the point. Only last November a son of mine and his wife arrived very unexpectedly from Germany, and expected his father to provide accommodation. I was unable to do so, and he promptly said, "I am going off to such-and-such a number in such-and-such a street in South Kensington. In Germany we all know that that is an excellent place to go for a short leave." I said, "What is the name of the lessee?". My son told me that he had not the slightest idea, although he knew the place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a very common occurrence in South Kensington, and I am afraid that if this paragraph remains all the rights in connection with these very successful businesses may come to an end with the determination of their leases, and I do not see why this type of tenant should be treated differently from the rest. I do not take the same interest in the business of letting a block of flats, whether the office
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2737</span>
is on the premises or in some agency office round the corner. That seems to be a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am primarily concerned with those people who live on the premises which they use for the purpose of providing very much desired accommodation for others. People who lease the whole of the premises and use them for the purpose of a business such as this should not be excluded from the benefits of the Bill. I know that my right hon. and learned Friend is considering the matter, and I hope that he will be able to safeguard the position of the people about whom I am concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of this paragraph is to deal with the type of case to which the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) drew attention, where, in a block of flats or offices, the tenant of the block occupies a letting office in which he carries on the business of letting the rest of the block. The problem is to what extent Part II should apply to that type of property. The object of Part II is to protect the occupying tenant of business premises, but in this case by far the greater part of the block of flats or offices is not occupied by the tenant. He is occupying a small part, but in the main the block is an investment for him, and one cannot regard the block, as a whole, as the tenant's business, in the sense that that business is carried on in the whole of the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One approach to the problem would have been to protect the tenant in respect of the small part which he retains—the letting office and, perhaps, the entrance hall and the stores. That would be the result of omitting this paragraph. The objection to that course is a very strong one. It would put the tenant in an unduly strong position, because he would be able to press the landlord to grant a new tenancy of the whole block. He would be entitled to a new tenancy of the part which he occupies, and could use that as a lever to secure a new tenancy of the remainder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a part of the object of the Bill to enable the tenant to insist upon a new tenancy of the whole block, because to him the block is primarily an investment
	<span class='label label-info column'>2738</span>
Part II aims at protecting the occupier and not the investor. It is for that reason that we think that special provision must be made in respect of the type of letting where the tenant sub-lets practically the whole of the premises and occupies a small part to manage his business of subletting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to the two cases referred to by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for South Kensington (Sir P. Spens)—boarding houses and hotels. So far as I can see, neither will be in the least affected by this provision. The people who manage hotels do not sub-let the accommodation they provide. Persons who stay at hotels for a night do so on licence; they are not tenants. The same consideration applies to boarding houses. The owners of boarding houses and private hotels will come within Part II, notwithstanding the provisions of para. (
	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case, which my right hon. and learned Friend did not mention, but which is somewhat analogous is the Victorian house whose owner no longer occupies the whole premises himself but has sublet on a lease or tenancy the first, second and, perhaps, third floors, and lives in the ground floor himself. This paragraph will not affect him because it cannot be said that the occupant of the flat on the ground floor is carrying on the business of managing a large block of offices. He is occupying that flat because he has sub-let the rest of the premises, and para, (
	<i>c</i>) will not apply to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have given most careful consideration to this paragraph, which is designed to deal solely with the type of case I have mentioned, namely, the big block of flats or offices where the letting office is retained and occupied for the management and running of the rest of the property. For the reasons I have advanced, we think that that type of occupation must be excluded from Part II. I do not think that the fears expressed by my right hon. and learned Friend are justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have regard to what has been said, and if we can find a form of words which makes the position clearer we shall be willing to see if we can incorporate them. It is not an easy problem. It is clearly right that the type of case to which the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington referred should be excluded, but we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2739</span>
do not want to exclude boarding houses, apartment houses and hotels. As the Clause nows stands, we do not think that they will be excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the hon. and learned Solicitor-General has said, I do not want to prolong the debate. Perhaps I may offer the excuse that it is not often that I find myself in agreement with the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington, South (Sir P. Spens), and I want to make the most of it. The Solicitor-General says that he will look at the matter again. I am very grateful for that. I agree with a great deal of what he said; we want to protect the occupying tenant and not the investor. But he also said that the boarding house keeper and the hotel keeper would not fall within the provisions of this paragraph because, under the existing law, what they grant is a licence and not a tenancy. I should like to know on what authority he says that. Has it been decided by the courts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking about Victorian houses, with one, two or three floors let out, but about boarding houses, where the managers have occupying tenants who live on the premises for six months, two years or three years, in one or two rooms which are sublet to them. Is the Solicitor-General prepared to say that the courts have authoritatively decided that a person who so occupies is not a tenant but a licensee of those rooms? If there is any doubt about that we might find ourselves in the position of having excluded from Part II of the Bill persons who run boarding houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
.10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought, at any rate, that the least that we could ask the Government would be to ensure, by making some exceptions to the provisions of paragraph (
	<i>c</i>), that there could be no doubt that a person who rents a boarding house of that sort is not excluded from the advantages of the Bill. I do not know whether the Solicitor-General could indicate the authority as to whether a person who occupies rooms in such circumstances is a licensee or a tenant. I should have thought, on first flush, that there is considerable doubt, in some cases at any rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then he turned to the large Victorian houses of which two or three floors are
	<span class='label label-info column'>2740</span>
let. What about the case of the owner or lessee of a house of that sort who lives on the ground floor and provides service to those who are tenants of the first, second and third floor? He may provide such services as cleaning and lighting, and it may well be that he is a person who conducts a trade there. There could be no doubt in a case of that sort that the occupier of the first, second or third floor would be the tenant of that floor. I should have thought that paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) in that case would have the result of excluding that kind of house from the advantages of the Bill. I plead with the Solicitor-General to say that he will undertake to include in paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) words which will put it beyond doubt that the owners of boarding houses or people who run such large Victorian houses are not excluded from the advantages of this part of the Bill by virtue of this paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the name of the case in which it was decided that a resident in an hotel or boarding house is a licensee because I have not it in mind. But if the right hon. and learned Member for Sheffield, Neepsend (Sir F. Soskice) would consult the landlord and tenant volume of Halsbury which I wrote, he will find that it is clearly established that the resident in an hotel or boarding house is not a tenant, but a licensee. I have no doubt about that at all. But there is a possibility that the manager of a boarding house might sublet part of the boarding house. If he does so, the part so sublet is occupied by a tenant. The position there would depend on the narrow line whether or not the premises retained by the tenant were occupied for conducting the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the premises retained by the tenant were used for providing services for the part that was sublet the position in those circumstances in respect only of that part of the premises would be analogous to the position of the letting office of a large block of property. We do not feel that where that analogy exists it should be brought within Part II, but it is a real problem and we have been considering whether the best way of drawing the line might not be to provide in relation to paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) that that paragraph should only apply where a tenant was a body corporate. That would be somewhat illogical, but it might produce the result
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2741</span>
we all want, because I do not think that there is anything between us on both sides of the Committee as to what we want to bring about. The only question is whether we have hit the target by this draft. We will consider that point and will give careful consideration to the question of whether an Amendment on the lines of this proposed Amendment could be made on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir P. Spens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have every variation of house from the simple boarding house, where one can get no more than a bedroom and one has to come down to a common room for meals, to the larger houses where, in addition to that service, other rooms are let off furnished or unfurnished to tenants. We have every variety of these big houses in South Kensington, and my view is that as long as the lessee of the whole premises lives on the premises and carries out the business of letting furnished or unfurnished rooms he may have a goodwill which ought to be protected. I am much more concerned with the individual than with the limited companies with which I have no great sympathy when they take these premises to offer them to let. If my hon. and learned Friend will reconsider the matter and make sure that, in general, the words in this paragraph are not too wide, I hope that the Committee will be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeffington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee will agree that it was very well worth while putting the Amendment on the Order Paper because to my mind there still seems to be some doubt as to what class of business is covered by paragraph (
	<i>c</i>). I take it that the Solicitor-General is pretty well satisfied that hotels and boarding houses are excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the normal case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Skeffington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a little doubt about some of those curious cases into which sub-tenants enter, but with the undertakings that I gather the Solicitor-General has given that the matter will be looked into again, possibly the wisest thing would be to leave it there on that assurance. I feel that there are matters of principle on which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>2742</span>
entirely happy, but on the Solicitor-General's assurance I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 31, line 24, to leave out paragraph (
	<i>d</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise because I know what was in the minds of my hon. Friends who put this Amendment on the Order Paper. We wish to have some indication of the effect of paragraph (
	<i>d</i>) which in effect excludes from the benefit of the Bill rent controlled premises. We do not necessarily criticise that at all. 
	<i>Prima facie</i>, it may seem to be reasonable that if one has protection under one Act one does not need it under another. On the other hand, the position is not quite as simple as that. The Rent Acts referred primarily to dwelling-houses and this Bill refers principally to business premises. But there might be overlapping cases. What kind of cases do the Government have in mind as coming under the provisions of the Rent Acts, and therefore not coming under the provisions of this Bill? We should like to have some indication of the scope and effect of this paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This paragraph also deals with a point of considerable difficulty and complexity and it is only after giving the matter the most careful consideration that we made this provision. I will indicate the problem that has confronted us and the reasons why we came to this decision, but it is a very involved matter. First, the Committee should bear in mind that the small tenant who lives above his shop may come within the provisions of the Rent Acts as they now are or may come within Part I of this Bill so that already we have two possible codes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The CHAIRMAN'S 
	<i>attention having been called to the fact that fifteen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings</i>; 
	<i>and, other Members having come into the room, and fifteen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed</i>.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, we may have two possible codes which provide protection for a particular tenant. One cannot leave the problem there and not deal with it. It would not suffice just to leave out paragraph (
	<i>d</i>) and so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2743</span>
bring mixed premises into Part II. At one moment, it looked attractive to give the tenant the possibility of choosing whether he would seek Rent Acts protection or protection under Part II, but for the reasons which I shall shortly give we think that that would be wrong. It is not enough to leave out paragraph (
	<i>d</i>) because if we are to bring mixed premises within Part II as well as within the Rent Acts then, to avoid confusion, it would be essential to lay down how the two codes are to interact. The way in which the 1927 Act now interacts on premises which are subject to the Rent Acts is by no means clear. It would have to be cleared up by very complicated provisions if we made some provisions of that character. I need say no more than that it would be quite intolerable if the Bill merely provided that both codes applied without dealing with the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the landlord gave notice with a view to bringing a statutory tenancy into operation, but the tenant wished the case to be dealt with under Part II, there would have to be some procedure for such a case to come under that part of the Bill. The tenant would have to give notice to that effect, and a time for doing that would have to be laid down. When the tenant had chosen the code by which he wished to apply he would have to abide by that choice. If he chose Part II and the landlord started proceedings for redevelopment, the tenant should not be able to switch over to the Rent Acts under which redevelopment is not a ground for possession. It would be necessary to specify how long the tenant's choice should operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he chose Part II, and was awarded a new tenancy under that part, ought he to be entitled to revert to a tenancy under the Rent Acts, or should he be required to abide by the original contract? Would the tenancy apply to his successors and to sub-tenants? Part II would only apply to the business part of the premises, the shop and not the living accommodation above it, and, if he chose Part II tenancy for the shop, should he be allowed to continue as a statutory tenant of the living accommodation? If so, how would the standard rent of the living accommodation be ascertained? The right hon. and learned Member for Sheffield, Neepsend will surely agree that
	<span class='label label-info column'>2744</span>
all these are highly technical, but, nevertheless, very real points, and one cannot deal with this problem merely by leaving out paragraph (
	<i>d</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question to which we have applied our minds is whether it is really in the public interest to have this very great additional complexity simply in order to give a particular class of tenant the choice of relying on the Rent Acts provisions, or upon Part II. We have come to the conclusion that it would not be in the public interest for the reason that the very complexity of the provisions would create the risk of their failing to help precisely the type of tenant for which they were intended. It seems clear that the tenant would have to choose between the two codes and then abide by his choice, at any rate for some time ahead. It would be only too easy for the small man to lose his chance through failing to serve the right notice at the right time. Therefore, it seems that the elaborate provisions which would have to be made here would defeat their own ends because of their elaboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further argument that, even if provisions of this character were of real benefit to sitting tenants, it is doubtful whether they would be beneficial to the public at large. The incoming tenant, the prospective assignee and landlord's interests would not be able to ascertain their rights, and a great burden would be placed on all those dealing with property of this kind. We feel that the complications would be bound to be such that they would become almost intolerable. While we have considered the matter very carefully, we feel, for the reasons I have advanced, that it is really best to exclude from the provisions of Part II the mixed premises which obtain the benefit of the Rent Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to that long address, for which I am grateful, but I must confess that, as matters stand at present, it has not convinced me. Speaking for myself, the advice I would give my hon. Friends would be to hold their hand at present and to consider the speech of the Solicitor-General in order to make up our minds what attitude to adopt on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the speech of the Solicitor-General comes to is that he says the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2745</span>
sort of person who would be affected would be the tenant living above shop premises. If the Amendment were carried, that person could choose between Rent Acts protection and Part II protection. I do not suppose there has ever been a Solicitor-General who could not make the results of anything sound unbelievably complex, but I do not believe that these results would be anything like as complex as the hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot help observing that when we were anxious, at earlier stages of the Bill, to prevent tenants being faced with difficulties owing to the drafting of the Bill, the Government were very much inclined to turn a deaf ear and to say in effect that they could not bother with that kind of consideration. Now, when there is a question of the landlord being protected, they show a remarkable solicitude and are anxious that their Bill should not provide complications in the case of the tenant. I think that the Government should be more impartial in their approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that I am not satisfied about this terrific complexity which it is said would be caused by giving the tenant of shop premises such a choice. I feel there is no adequate reason for putting in paragraph (
	<i>d</i>), but I should like to consider further the alarming and elaborate address to which we have listened before making up my mind. I hope that my hon. Friends will agree that the proper course to adopt is to suspend judgment for the moment, and not to press this Amendment at this particular moment. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir P. Spens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 32, line 3, at the end, to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>J</i>) to a tenancy imposing on a tenant an obligation to employ services plant machinery or equipment provided for valuable consideration by the landlord elsewhere than on the demised premises and the rent payable by the tenant in consequence of such obligation is substantially less than a rack rent."</p></blockquote>
I very much regret the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) because this Amendment raises a point which essentially affects Lancashire and the North.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2746</span>
As I understand, in Manchester and elsewhere in the area of the textile industry there are very large packing warehouses to which textile goods are sent for packing and preparation to be delivered by rail or by ship overseas. These packing warehouses have for a very long time been in the habit of having attached to them a number of smaller properties which the warehouse people equip with special machinery and let to tenants on an extremely low rental basis, provided the tenant lives there and uses the machinery for the purpose of doing packing business for the warehouse owners. Apparently, in Manchester there are a large number of tenants who carry out on their premises, a business of what I might call subsidiary packing, and they have those premises at a very low rental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, it would appear that as the term of one of these tenancies was getting near its end the tenant would apply for a new tenancy and the warehouse owner would be extremely anxious about what might be the result of such application. It appears to be a very specialised business, and the owners ask the Government to consider very particularly whether or not what I might almost call tied tenancies ought not to be omitted altogether from this part of the Bill. I hope I have explained the point rightly in the unexpected absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Darwen, and I hope that the Government will consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The position he has outlined is a somewhat unusual one and I understand that tenancies of the kind he described usually contain a provision enabling them to be terminated by fairly short notice, and also a covenant by the tenant that he will give his packing business to his landlord. It is tied in that sort of way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend will observe and will agree that it is right that we have limited complete exemption in Part II to cases in which there are quite compelling reasons, such as those concerned with Government Departments, local authorities, and statutory undertakings among others. Consequently,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2747</span>
very telling exceptional circumstances would have to exist before one could claim exemption of the type suggested. We have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to do so in this particular case. We do not feel that the landlords who enter into these somewhat unusual arrangements are likely to suffer any material hardship under the Bill as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the tenant who is under covenant to give his packing business to his landlord does not do so, either because he changes his business or changes his packer, presumably he will be in breach of a term of his tenancy, in which case the landlord can oppose the grant of a new tenancy under Clause 30, subsection (1, 
	<i>c</i>). It would be open to the landlord to give notice of termination. Supposing the tenant asked for a renewal and was entitled to obtain a renewal, the tenant would have to pay the current market rent and not the low rent stipulated in the lease because the tenant has to give a great deal of business to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Bill seeks to ensure is that the landlord in those circumstances will get, and the tenant in those circumstances will pay, a fair market rent. We do not think it right that it should be open to the landlord to oust a sitting tenant, who is prepared to pay a fair market rent, in favour of an alternative tenant who may be more profitable to the landlord because of the business he can bring to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill now operates, we feel that if the tenant does not comply with his obligations, it would be possible either for the landlord to obtain possession, if he so desired, or to obtain a fair market rent for the premises so let. In those circumstances, we do not think it would be right to grant complete exemption of the kind which is sought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Angus Maude</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in page 32, line 3, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(
	<i>f</i>) to a tenancy which has been created by a local authority of property which has been acquired by them with a view to its being wholly or partly demolished."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2748</span>
I feel some diffidence in making my maiden speech in this Committee. It seems almost like a second home after all these weeks. This Amendment deals with a matter which certain urban authorities think is of some importance. The principal object of Part II of the Bill is to provide security of tenure to tenants. It is felt that there is a certain class of tenants involved here who went into property with their eyes open to the fact that the property had been bought by the local authority for demolition and where the rent was negotiated freely with that fact in view. Also, the length of the stay agreed upon had reference to the prospect of demolition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of the local authority it is a little unfair that the authority should have to pay compensation and be bound by restrictions as to the length of notice in a case like that and the result might very well be that property, which could have a useful life of occupation for a limited period of time, may as a result be left unoccupied by the local authority in order to avoid what the local authority regard as a substantial cost to the ratepayer if compensation has to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were discussing an earlier Amendment, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) described some of the difficulties into which local authorities had got with redevelopment schemes. He was asking for a very much wider exemption than the Amendment I am moving seeks to ensure. This Amendment is limited to seeking exemption for lettings by local authorities of properties specifically acquired for demolition and, when these become vacant, they are re-let until such time as they are demolished, the new tenants being absolutely aware of the insecurity of their tenancy and having negotiated the rent with that in view. I understand that the official view on this matter was that where the letting is merely temporary and simply pending redevelopment, the local authority can contract out of the liability for compensation by virtue of Clause 38 (3) and Clause 56 (2) with paragraph 5 of the Ninth Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of the urban local authorities, that is not altogether satisfactory because the local authority will still have to pay further compensation where the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2749</span>
temporary tenant or his predecessors in business have occupied the property for more than five years. In other words, this Amendment will enable the local authority to contract out of the liability in the case of a tenancy which does not exceed a term of five years. We know that many local authority development schemes have been held up for reasons over which they had no control for periods considerably in excess of five years, where the Government had good and sufficient reason, connected with the availability of resources—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The CHAIRMAN'S 
	<i>attention having been called to the fact that fifteen Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and, other Members having come into the room, and fifteen Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maude</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, many local authority development schemes have been held up for considerably longer than five years possibly by Government restrictions on capital expenditure. In many cases local authorities bought property for demolition and let it for indefinite periods which now exceed a period of five years. Therefore, it seems only just to eliminate from the compensation all lettings which fall into the category I have described. I am aware that during the debate on the Second Reading the Home Secretary touched on this matter when dealing with Clauses 54 to 57, and said that he was introducing certain modifications, but he made it clear that the modifications related only to this matter. Government Departments were to receive no special treatment in respect of compensation, and a Government Department would have to compensate in respect of a new tenancy on grounds comparable with those of the private landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the case of the local authority is not strictly comparable with that of a Government Department because only in very rare cases is the Department undertaking demolition and redevelopment for a specified and planned purpose. I agree that the tenant's case for compensation may appear strong where the letting has not been specifically negotiated with the prospect in view of early demolition, but it is very difficult to see why compensa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>2750</span>
tion should be paid at the ratepayers' expense to a tenant whose conditions are based on the certainty that he would have to go sooner or later when demolition was undertaken. For those reasons, I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend can make some concession to local authorities in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to disappoint my hon. Friend in this respect. We cannot accept the Amendment. We discussed the point earlier in our deliberations, and I will not now repeat the arguments which were advanced on that occasion. I will merely summarise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that it would be wrong to make the distinction which is suggested between the local authority and other kinds of landlord. The private person as well as the local authority may let premises temporarily, pending demolition and redevelopment, and it would be wrong to discriminate against the tenant of a local authority by depriving him of rights which other tenants enjoy. It would also be wrong to discriminate against the private landlord who wants to redevelop by putting local authority landlords in a favourable position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes it clear that local authorities can be sure of getting possession when they need it for the purpose of carrying out their duties. That is secured by the certificate procedure under Clause 54. There is no difficulty about that. The local authority has to give notice that it needs possession for the purpose of carrying out its functions. If it thinks it will not need possession quite soon it can contract out of liability under Clause 38 to provide compensation. That contracting-out will operate if the tenant does not occupy the premises for more than five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities buy property with a view to ultimate demolition years before they intend to acquire the property. If the tenant has been in occupation for five, 10, or 15 years, conducting the business and the property is required for demolition, why should he not have the same right to compensation as any other tenant? We think he should, and it is for that reason that we must decline to accept the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other effect of the Amendment must be mentioned. Supposing the local authority had let for a short term
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2751</span>
and then the question came up of renewal for a further short term. If the Amendment were accepted, the tenant would not be able to go to the court in regard to the terms of renewal. We think that the tenant should have that right like other tenants under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maude</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for his answer, but I cannot say that I find it wholly satisfactory. I do not propose to press the Amendment, but in cases where a local authority has already paid compensation on acquisition it may not be altogether right that they should have to pay compensation again. Therefore, I may feel it desirable on the Report stage to strengthen the provisions for contracting out under Clause 38. Subject to that reservation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 32, line 15, to leave out subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems surprising that this subsection should have been put in. The Home Secretary will remember that the Interim Report of the Leasehold Committee expressed itself in page 29, paragraph 4, against there being any qualifying period, and that Clause 26 (1) deals with tenancies granted for a term of years exceeding one year. The subsection which I am moving to omit makes provision for tenancies of three months and six months. The purpose of the Amendment is to find out the mind of the Minister in view of these apparent anomalies. Perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman will enlighten the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has very rightly drawn attention to this provision. I am glad to be able to give him a short, but, I hope, wholly satisfactory answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this subsection is to make provision for particular cases of lettings, for instance of sites for exhibitions or fairgrounds, for a very short term. In short-term lettings of that kind many of the occupants are under licence and not under lease. We think that it is right to make provision that the tenant who has deliberately taken a short-term tenancy shall not turn round and be
	<span class='label label-info column'>2752</span>
thoroughly awkward, trying to get something to which he is not entitled. The subsection holds out no opening whatsoever for the landlord to abuse the provisions of the Clause by providing that all his lettings shall be for three months. If the occupation is for more than six months, the exclusion does not operate at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the position can be left quite as the Solicitor-General has left it. The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the object of the limitation in the subsection was to exclude things like fairgrounds and shows, and that in a number of such cases the persons who conducted fairs were not tenants but licensees. This gives rise to a question similar to that which arose when we were talking about boarding houses. If the Government wish to make sure that persons who occupy premises—I leave out the controversial term "lease"—for the purpose of running a fair shall be excluded, would it not be much better to exclude them in specific terms?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have introduced in this subsection a general exclusion of premises which do not exceed three months, with some exceptions. I should have thought one might constantly get cases of tenancies which start out as weekly; technically, weekly tenancies can come to an end at the end of a week. They do not normally contain provision for renewal which would bring them within paragraph (
	<i>a</i>). I see that the Joint Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department has discovered something in his brief which deals with weekly tenancies, and has drawn it to the attention of the Solicitor-General. I do not know whether he has found the answer. It must be within the experience of the Government that innumerable small businesses consist of tenancies for a week or a month, or are on a somewhat informal basis which it is not easy to say is weekly or monthly. Unless I am mistaken, and unless the Joint Under-Secretary of State has discovered some provision which remedies that particular defect, all those tenancies would be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Interim Report, as my hon. Friend has just pointed out, was against any qualifying period. It is common sense, is it not, that the very fact that a person moves into premises to carry on business,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2753</span>
whether his tenancy is weekly, monthly, or yearly means that there has been considerable upheaval and upset in his arrangements? He would not go into premises to start a business unless he brought all the equipment for that purpose and had made all the preliminary arrangements satisfying him that he could make a living. Those facts show the intention of permanence and stability in the mind of the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government in these circumstances, in order to include the rare cases of fairs and showgrounds—in which cases, anyhow, the legal relationship would probably be licensor and licensee and not landlord and tenant—have apparently put at risk all the very large numbers of tenants of small business premises. Unless there is an answer to that—there may be one which I have overlooked—it seems to me that my hon. Friend has uncovered a very serious defect in the drafting of the Bill. For some reason—the only reason put forward is that of the fairgrounds—the Government have departed from the recommendation of the Committee and have put in this limitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be able to consider the matter again. If they wished to prevent recalcitrant occupiers of fairgrounds from taking undue advantage of the fact that they have gone in there to start a fair I should have thought that a reasonable way to do it would have been to incorporate a specific exception in the earlier part of the Clause, but to include in the Clause a general sweeping exception which will affect very large numbers of tenants of small business premises seems to me to be wholly unjustified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. and learned Gentleman was well founded in his argument, there would be great force in his observations, particularly in relation to weekly tenancies. He has overlooked the fact, which is clear from line 15, that the subsection applies only to tenancies granted for a term. A periodic tenancy is not granted for a term, and, therefore all periodic tenancies—weekly, monthly or annual—cannot come within this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of our proposal is, as I have stated, to deal with particular instances. There is no risk of abuse or
	<span class='label label-info column'>2754</span>
risk of the consequences which the right hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested. Subsection (3, 
	<i>b</i>) indicates that, even though the letting was for a period of three months or less, if there has been occupation for the purposes of a business by either the present occupier or his predecessor exceeding six months, the provisions of the Bill apply. That is the provision which is meant to deal with short tenancies, of the sort which I indicated, for what I thought would be an obvious reason, to prevent abuse on one side or the other. I should have thought that we need not worry too much about it now as I have made it clear to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the Bill provides that this cannot apply to periodic tenancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the most bogus lawyer's arguments that I have listened to for a long time. Is not a week a term? Is not a fortnight a term? The Solicitor-General says that a weekly tenancy is not a tenancy for a term. Will he refer me to any authority for that statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really cannot undertake to instruct the right hon. and learned' Gentleman in the elementary principles of the law of landlord and tenant, but I will willingly send him a copy of Halsbury's "Laws of England" dealing with landlord and tenant legislation in which I am sure I shall be able to draw his attention to a passage which will make it clear that periodic tenancies are quite distinct from tenancies granted for a term.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might reciprocate the compliment by sending a copy to the hon. and learned Gentleman so that we could then both read it. I should have thought that the argument that a letting for a week or a fortnight, which may or may not be a periodic letting, is not within the terms of this exception was a dangerous one. It may be right or wrong, but, at any rate, will the Government undertake to look at the wording of the exception? I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General would listen to me, because this really is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says that it is not, but if he will be so good as to listen and not rely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2755</span>
upon the authority of his position to the extent to which he has been doing, he will realise that the anxiety that we feel lest by incautious drafting weekly tenancies have been excluded is a genuine one which ought to be attended to by the Government. It is no answer for the Solicitor-General to say that he will send me a copy of a text-book. If his knowledge was so extensive and certain as he makes it out to be, he would be able to refer me to some authority, but he has not been able to do that. It is hardly courteous of him to refer to text-books in the airy and rather offensive way in which he has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government to pay attention to a point which has been put forward seriously. That is the least for which I can ask. Maybe I am wrong; maybe I am right. At any rate, the point is one which requires to be looked at. I ask the Solicitor-General to have the courtesy to say that he will give proper attention to the point and make sure that the wording, for which he, as a Law Officer of the Crown, bears a large share of responsibility, will not exclude many millions of tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to have an answer to the point or not? The Solicitor-General really must recognise that, holding the position that he does, he owes a debt of courtesy to the House and to the Committee. If he is going to sit still and just look blankly at the paper in front of him and give no reply, I can assure him that his further progress in this House will not be as easy as we have allowed it to be hitherto. He will thoroughly deserve any difficulties into which he falls if he continues like this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

All that my right hon. and learned Friend asks—I think it is a reasonable thing to ask—is that the Government should before the Report stage make certain whether the view taken by the Solicitor-General or that taken by my right hon. and learned Friend is correct.

I should like to point out that my hon. Friends and I are very anxious to make progress. Nearly all the Amendments and speeches so far have come from the Government side of the Committee.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the Clause which defines the expression "landlord." When we dealt with Clause 22—the Solicitor-General was in a different frame of mind from the frame of mind which he has exhibited today—I asked him for an explanation for the purpose of the definition in the Clause which related to Part I of the Bill. The definition of the word "landlord" in Clause 42, dealing, broadly speaking, with the same material, is almost exactly the same, but it contains certain differences, and I should like the Solicitor-General, if he will be so good to attend to the question that I am putting to him and not offer to send me a text-book, to indicate the purpose of the Government in having this slightly different formulation of the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition in Clause 22 required that the landlord's reversion should be for a period of not less than five years. Putting it broadly, in this Part of the Bill the period of five years has been curtailed to 14 months. No doubt there is a perfectly good reason for that, and no doubt the Home Secretary would be able to indicate it in a very few words and with the courtesy which we are all accustomed to expect from him. Whether the Solicitor-General is to be put up to give us the explanation of the point this time I do not know, but I hope that it will be the Home Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to add one question. The Sixth Schedule is incorporated in the provisions of this Clause by subsection (3). I should be grateful if the Minister who replies would be so good as to indicate roughly—again, I do not want it in detail, but I think we are entitled to a general indication of the working—how
	<span class='label label-info column'>2758</span>
the Sixth Schedule will work in the case where the immediate landlord is not the owner of the fee simple in terms of subsection (3). I am not suggesting that there is a criticism that we should advance in a hostile sense to the definition that has been formulated, but we desire to understand in general terms how it works, which I think ought to go on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The freeholder, whom I shall call A for this purpose, has let premises to B for a term of years expiring on 31st March, 1956. B has sublet to C, whose sub-tenancy is continuing by virtue of Clause 24, which the right hon. and learned Gentleman will remember. On 30th June, 1955, the position will be that C's tenancy can be terminated by a notice under Clause 25 (2), expiring not earlier than 31st December, 1955, and not later than 30th June, 1956. If B, to whom the freeholder had let, were the landlord for the purpose of Clause 25, it would mean that he could serve a notice, bringing C's tenancy to an end, on a date at which he, B, would have ceased to have any interest in the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This absurdity would probably matter little alone, because no mesne landlord would have any inducement to serve such a notice. But the right hon. and learned Gentleman will appreciate that without this subsection the freeholder, who may be anxious to test in a court whether at the expiry of B's tenancy he can get possession of the premises for one of the purposes allowed by the Bill, will have to wait until after it has expired and then give C at least six months' notice. It is therefore more reasonable to make A the landlord for the purpose of this part of the Bill, since the fag end of B's tenancy is too short to enable him to serve as long a notice as possible on C—that is, 12 months. We have, in fact, allowed a small extension of time by making the period 14 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) is necessary because a notice to quit under the terms of a tenancy, as distinct from a notice of termination under Clause 25, is always given by the immediate landlord, and if the right hon. and learned Gentleman will look at subsection (1, 
	<i>b</i>) he will see that it would be meaningless without this subsection. The reason for subsection (3), introducing the Sixth Schedule, is that that Schedule provides for "chain" cases, and it is convenient that its provisions should be made applicable in this way. I have tried to explain the matter reasonably shortly, and I hope that I have met the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is one difficulty to which I should like to draw his attention, in relation to the times we propose. There is no magic in our times, or in his times, but there is one disadvantage about his proposal which I should like to put to him. I suggest that we should endeavour to find a compromise which will satisfy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2761</span>
us both. It should not be too difficult to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We selected a period of two months because it ensures that in most cases the claim for compensation will be submitted well before the end of the tenancy. That is desirable in order to enable the claim to be settled before the tenant leaves, because, as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, it is only where the tenant leaves that the question of compensation arises. In general, it will be more convenient for both parties to reach a settlement while the tenant is still in occupation. From the landlord's point of view it may be very important to know the extent of his liability. Before he makes his future dispositions—as to what price or what rent he will ask—he will want to know what sum he will have to pay to the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the six months' time limit proposed by the hon. Member will not ensure that the claim is submitted before the end of the tenancy. I can give two examples to illustrate my point. Where the landlord terminates the tenancy by notice under Clause 25 he need give only six months' notice, and a six months' period for claiming compensation might run up to the end of the tenancy. Secondly, if the tenant terminates the tenancy by a request for a new tenancy, under Clause 26, he, too, may give six months' notice. In this type of case the period for claiming compensation runs from the date of the landlord's reply, which may be two months after the tenant's request. A six months' period for claiming compensation might, therefore, run two months beyond the end of the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give further examples, and if we were debating this question in a different frame of mind I might make the debating point of the tenancy which ends by the effluxion of time. I am not approaching the matter in that way, but I do feel that a period of six months is rather too long. I undertake to consider the point and try to find the most suitable period, rather longer than the present two months, and deal with it on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 34, line 21, at the end, to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but section three of the Act of 1927 (which enables a landlord to object to a proposed improvement) shall not have effect in relation to an improvement made in pursuance of a statutory obligation except so much thereof as—

</ol></p></blockquote>
This Amendment is purely a question of machinery. It modifies the machinery provision of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1927, in relation to compensation for improvements. The Committee will remember that that Act excluded from compensation improvements made in pursuance of a statutory obligation, and subsection (1) of this Clause brings them into the field of compensation. The 1927 Act lays down the procedure to be followed by the tenant before making an improvement by which he wishes to qualify for compensation, and that procedure is not entirely appropriate for improvements carried out in pursuance of a statutory obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a short point, but it is of considerable importance as a matter of principle. My hon. Friends and I do not appreciate why the benefit of compensation for improvements should be confined to business tenancies. In our view, when a tenant of residential premises has taken steps to improve their value and has taken action which is as much to the landlord's advantage as to his own, there are good reasons why the landlord should pay for the benefit which he derives from what the tenant has done. This is a rather fundamental point, and we shall well understand if the right hon. and learned Gentleman says that he cannot accept it this morning, but we hope that he will give consideration to the elementary justice of this matter between now and the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. Lucas-Tooth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Walsall (Mr. W. Wells) has said, this is a point of considerable substance, although he moved the Amendment very briefly. The purpose of the Amendment is to extend to residential premises the provision for compensation for improvements. It is true that the Leasehold Committee recommended such an extension, although it did so with considerable hesitation. It is only right to refer hon. Members to paragraph 281 of its Report, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no doubt that improvements to business premises are made with very different purposes in view from improvements to residential premises. A business man inevitably has in mind the necessity to make his business pay its way, and improvements to business premises are made in order to increase the scale or efficiency of the business. Improvements to residential premises, by contrast, are made to satisfy personal needs and tastes and are themselves more liable to depend on the individual habits, pursuits, and even whims, of the particular residents. Since these are necessarily more susceptible to changes of fashion, the residential improvement of one decade may become a positive incubus by the next: thus the letting value of a house may nowadays actually be reduced by the addition of a number of extra rooms. Difficult problems of valuation are also liable to arise, in the opinion of members of the Committee professionally versed in such matters, in the assessment of the additional value, if any,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2764</span>
which may be ascribed to outdoor improvements such as landscaping, tennis courts or greenhouses."</p></blockquote>
That quotation shows the kind of difficulties that arise in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have given very thorough consideration to this matter, and, as is clear from the paragraph that I have just read, there are two main objections to doing what the Amendment suggests should be done. In the first place, the assessment of compensation presents great difficulty. There is immense room for differences of opinion on matters of taste, and clearly that kind of difference is likely to arise between a landlord and tenant in this connection. We feel that if compensation were payable in those circumstances it would often lead to disputes and indeed to litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are many cases where the landlord intends to occupy the house himself when the tenancy comes to an end and when the landlord does that the increased letting value is not really a fair test of compensation. For example, a tenant may have added a room to the house and although that may have increased the letting value it may have decreased the value of the house for the purpose of the landlord when he gets possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Glenvil Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Added bathrooms, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. Lucas-Tooth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know of one house where 16 bathrooms were added, and I strongly suspect that those additions did nothing to improve the value of the house in the eyes of the landlord when he returned to live there. Again, a heating system though adding to the value of the house, may increase considerably the cost of maintaining it and may be a positive incubus to the subsequent occupants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but, since he has referred to paragraph 281 of the Report, I hope that he will also read paragraphs 283 and 285 in the course of his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. Lucas-Tooth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said quite fairly that the Report came down in favour of the Amendment, and I read paragraph 281 to indicate the kind of difficulties that the members of the Committee felt. If the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2765</span>
wants to refer to other paragraphs no doubt he will do so later on. It is fair to point out that a landlord cannot maintain an objection to an improvement being carried out by a tenant if the tribunal holds that the improvement will increase the letting value. That is the effect of the 1927 Act, and so it would not be correct to suggest that the mere fact that the landlord objected would prevent the tenant from doing these things against the landlord's wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member suggested in his interruption, it is fair to say that the Leasehold Committee recognised these difficulties. They sought to overcome them by suggesting that the courts should have a very wide discretion, first, in deciding whether an improvement had a general or a specialised appeal, and, secondly, in having regard to the landlord's intentions in the matter. The Government have given this matter consideration and we feel that that approach is impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts cannot really decide matters of taste, and that is what this would come to in the vast majority of cases. It is unreasonable to require a court to come to a decision on a matter of taste without laying down the principles upon which it should arrive at a decision, and those principles are not suggested in the recommendations of the Leasehold Committee. How are we to decide, for instance, on the relative merits of an open fire and central heating? It may be that a more modern appliance would increase the letting value, but it might well be that the occupier would prefer the old system. Again, the example is constantly given of a tenant who builds a tennis court when the landlord wants a garden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that if the Bill were extended, as proposed, it would lead to a very great amount of disputation and litigation, and that this is not a proper matter to be left to the court. Therefore, having given these difficult questions, the careful consideration that they deserve, we feel that we must resist the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find what the Joint Under-Secretary has just said most disappointing. He referred to the difficulties to which the Jenkins Committee drew attention and stressed them, but he
	<span class='label label-info column'>2766</span>
failed to remind the Committee that the Jenkins Committee, after having considered those difficulties very carefully, nevertheless felt that all those difficulties could be overcome and that this principle of compensation for improvements in residential premises should be adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough to say that there are difficulties and to put forward the existence of those difficulties as a reason for resisting this Amendment. It may be a difficult question for the courts to determine, but I am quite convinced that the courts have determined far more difficult and complicated questions than those that might arise in these cases. Nor is it quite right to say, as the Joint Under-Secretary said, that the Jenkins Committee failed to lay down any guiding principles. The Committee indicates in paragraphs 283 and 284 the kind of principles by which a tribunal would be guided in determining whether improvements were or were not of a nature to justify compensation. Admittedly, borderline cases have arisen, and, because they have arisen, it is desirable not to draw the principles too rigidly, but to give the tribunal the maximum discretion. That seems to me a very sensible solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Under-Secretary has not appreciated that unless the Amendment is accepted there will continue to be cases of considerable hardship to tenants who introduce into residential premises improvements which are admittedly improvements, and which no landlord would dispute were improvements. It is particularly with those cases that we on this side of the Committee are concerned, and, in view of the fact that we have the support of the Jenkins Committee, I feel that we must press the Government to reconsider this matter very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Jenkins Committee, having considered the difficulties, went on to say, in paragraph 283:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On balance, however, we believe that if this procedure were extended to residential premises there would be adequate safeguards for the landlord against the risk of being saddled with alterations ranking as 'improvements' only in the eyes of the particular tenant who wished to undertake them."</p></blockquote>
Safeguards are considered and laid down and then, in paragraph 284, the Jenkins Committee suggests that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Tribunal should have the widest discretion to decide, in the light of all the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2767</span>
circumstances of each case, whether a projected improvement constitutes a genuine 'improvement'."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, there are differences between an improvement which is merely ephemeral in character and one which is likely to rank as permanent in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee goes on to say that the tribunal should take into account
	<br><blockquote><p>"… such factors as the probable duration of the tenant's interest in the premises! … and the landlord's future intentions …"</p></blockquote>
All these matters would be available for a tribunal to consider. I feel strongly that it is now recognised that, in principle, a tenant should have compensation for improvements in the same way as a tenant of business premises has compensation for improvements. The only possible reason for objecting to this Amendment is the complication of providing adequate machinery and safeguards, but the Jenkins Committee have indicated how that can be done. Therefore, it is not good enough for the Government to adopt a planned 
	<i>non possumus</i> attitude in this matter and to refuse to adopt the principle which was recommended by the Jenkins Committee and which could be quite well implemented with all the safeguards for the benefit of the landlord which that Committee recommended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Iorwerth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important question. I see no reason why there should be discrimination against the residential type of property in view of the recommendation of the Jenkins Committee after examining all the difficulties which the Joint Under-Secretary quoted from the Committee's Report. The Joint Under-Secretary quoted extreme cases where improvements have been made to satisfy the individual tastes of those in occupation. There may be some merit in the argument that it is very difficult for a court or tribunal to decide on a question of personal taste, but let us take what is accepted as a very common feature of improvements in residential premises in industrial towns of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
South Wales is a very good example. If one could have access to the material that is available in the offices of the local authorities of South Wales, one would find what improvements have been made to their houses by what we in South Wales call the owner-occupier type of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2768</span>
person. The improvements were made because of the smallness and physical limitations of the houses, and because in times past the industrial communities generally were noted for their large families. It was a question of families of five, six, seven, or eight children. The owner had to look around in order to improve the capacity of the house to accommodate the growing family. Undoubtedly there are thousands of cases which one could instance where substantial structural improvements have been effected by the owner-occupier in order to accommodate large families and the alterations have improved the value of the premises to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In South Wales, ground landlords are not so much individual owners of property as, in the main, large financial corporations. They would not desire to keep the premises for themselves when they became vacant, and they would be inconvenienced by any structural alteration made in the course of time because such alterations could not fit in with their personal taste. I think this discrimination is an unfair one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can visualise that thousands of tenants will be deprived of what after all should be fair compensation for the improvements for which they have been responsible. I ask the Solicitor-General to give further consideration to this matter and to dismiss from his mind reference to such things as a tennis court or garden improvements but to consider the actual physical improvements made to these houses as it is unfair that these people should be deprived of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall, however, try to deal with the matter as shortly as I can. I regret the despondency apparent on the features of the Solicitor-General, but I feel that it would be wrong to part with this Amendment, having heard the difficulties cited from the Jenkins Committee Report, without setting out in detail what the arguments were which led the Jenkins Committee, on the whole, to decide to over-ride those difficulties. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2769</span>
turn to paragraph 283 of the Report where the Committee states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On balance, however, we believe that if this procedure were extended to residential premises there would be adequate safeguards for the landlord against the risk of being saddled with alterations ranking as 'improvements' only in the eyes of the particular tenant who wished to undertake them. The relevant S.3 (1) permits the Tribunal to authorise the making of improvements only if they are of such a nature as to be calculated to add to the letting value of the holding, and are reasonable and suitable to the character of the holding. Moreover, assuming the retention of the principle that compensation is payable only for improvements which add to the letting value of the holding at the termination of the tenancy."</p></blockquote>
That deals with the change of fashion. What we are looking at is the letting value at the termination of the tenancy.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The landlord cannot be held liable to pay compensation for any improvement so authorised which does not in fact have that result. We have referred to the possibility that the letting value of a house may be reduced by the addition of a large number of rooms: if the tenant applied for authority to make such an addition as an 'improvement' ranking for compensation under the Act, his application would fail, unless the Tribunal was satisfied that in the circumstances of the particular case the contemplated addition was calculated to add to the letting value of the holding at the termination of the tenancy. Assuming authority was given, no compensation would be payable if at the end of the tenancy it was found that the addition had in fact not increased the letting value of the holding. Authority for such operations as adding a concrete and chromium sun parlour to a fine period house would, we assume, be refused by the Tribunal on the ground that it was not reasonable or suitable to the character of the holding (even if permitted under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>284. We note the view generally taken by those of our witnesses—notably landlords and professional bodies—who have addressed themselves to this question that there is no reason of principle for distinguishing between residential and business premises in the matter of compensation for improvements. Their view is clearly that the extension of the compensation provisions to residential improvements would be a small but non-controversial and sensible reform, likely to encourage tenants to make useful improvements to their premises: and we should find it difficult to reject this view because of possible administrative difficulties. We suggest however that the Tribunal should have the widest discretion to decide, in the light of all the circumstances of each case, whether a projected improvement constitutes a genuine 'improvement.' They should of course take into account the character of the alteration proposed, and consider whether it is one likely to have a general or a highly specialised appeal limited to future
	<span class='label label-info column'>2770</span>
residents with particular interests: thus while a second bathroom in a four-bedroomed house might be considered an improvement by most tenants, a cocktail bar would interest only those whose tastes happened to coincide with those of the tenant proposing to install it."</p></blockquote>
Such perhaps as the Solicitor-General, when called upon to listen to a speech of mine.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Again, an alteration calculated to add to the letting value of the house when relet to another tenant might be quite beyond the means of a small landlord intending to re-occupy the house himself, and the obligation to pay compensation in such a case might impose genuine hardship. The Tribunal should also consider whether the 'improvement' was ephemeral in character, or was likely to rank as an improvement in the future. In addition, we think they should take into account such factors as the probable duration of the tenant's interest in the premises—and hence the extent of the enjoyment he might expect to derive from the improvement—and the landlord's future intentions e.g. as regards personal occupation. They should we consider be free to take the very broadest view in deciding whether or not to authorise—and subsequently whether to award compensation for—an improvement to residential premises.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>285. On balance, therefore, we suggest the application of the principle to all types of residential tenancy. We make this general recommendation at once, so that it may be borne in mind in the more detailed discussion of the question which follows."</p></blockquote>
I apologise for detaining the Committee for so long, but I cannot apologise for reading the very judicial arguments which led the Jenkins Committee, under its distinguished chairman, to accept a view which the Government are today rejecting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of past debates in this Committee we have heard the Government defend very wide powers, which we have often thought were too wide, for the tribunals which will be called upon to deal with this matter. We consider that this is an important question of principle. Should the Home Secretary now choose to decide to say that he will consider this further between now and the next stage, we should not press the matter further. But we do not think it is adequate to say that the courts should not be called upon to decide questions of taste. They are not called upon to decide questions of taste, but are called upon simply to decide whether particular improvements add to the value of the holding at the time of the termination of the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view, the difficulties in the courts coming to a reasonable decision

The Amendment proposes an adaptation in the Leasehold Property (Repairs) Act, 1938. The Clause already proposes to extend the scope of that Act from houses to property of all kinds.

The Clause is another illustration of the grave necessity to introduce as soon as possible an extension of the Legal Aid Act in order that litigants in the county court shall have the same facilities for legal aid as litigants in the High Court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would add one word to what my hon. Friend has said. I would be grateful if the Home Secretary indicated how Clause 51 will work before the provisions for which my hon. Friend has asked are introduced. I have heard people wondering what a legal aid committee would feel to be their duty on receiving an application for legal aid in the High Court in order to obtain the declaration envisaged by Clause 51, when it is pointed out to them that the applicant could perfectly well go to the county court where, of course, he could not obtain legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A legal aid committee might hesitate, legitimately, before granting a certificate for legal aid in the High Court when there is an alternative remedy in the county court. The committee might find themselves in serious difficulty. Cases might be sent to the county court, where no legal aid can be obtained, and an applicant might find it very difficult to pursue his remedy in that court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps these apprehensions are not well founded, but I would be grateful if the Home Secretary would consider them. The case is strong for introducing legal aid provisions into the county court, and consideration should be given to a situation as it might emerge under the Clause before such legal aid provisions are introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I willingly promise consideration, but I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will not press me for comment at this stage. Frankly, this is not a point which I had considered, and I would not like any words by the Home Secretary to appear to be laying down a rule which legal aid committees should follow. I am sure the committees will do their utmost to find the most equitable solutions of their problems, and to help persons who come to them. I should not like to say more than that. It might be thought an intrusion on my part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. His answer entirely satisfies me. We have called attention to the difficulty which might well present itself to legal aid committees. I quite understand that the Home Secretary would not wish to give expression to an opinion without having fully considered it. It would be highly desirable so to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Question put, and agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
</section>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 52.</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>—(DETERMINATION OF TENANCIES OF DERELICT LAND.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 37, line 18, to leave out "three," and to insert "twelve."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is designed, according to the side note, to make it possible to determine tenancies—I underline the words—of derelict land, but the Clause as it stands would hardly seem to be limited to land which could be described as "derelict." Relief under the Clause can be granted by the county court if the landlord can satisfy the court that he has taken all reasonable steps to communicate with the person last known to be the tenant, and that during the last three months the premises have been standing empty and abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Amendment would extend the period from three months to 12 months. There may be cases in which the tenant did not intend to abandon the premises, although they might in fact be empty. One can imagine tenants in humble circumstances who have gone to some other part of the country to obtain employment, or by reason of illness, or to visit friends or relatives, and they are temporarily absent. The tenant may be an old lady or some other elderly person, normally living in the premises alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial injustice might be done under the Clause as it stands, perhaps unwittingly. There is more concern about this if one assumes an unscrupulous landlord, who is able to point to the fact that the premises have been vacant for three months and can make out a case that he has found difficulty in communicating with the tenant. We can well imagine a landlord, with the best intentions in the world, finding it difficult to communicate with the sort of tenant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2775</span>
I have suggested. The unscrupulous landlord sees to it that the premises have been empty for three months, and then he goes to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In putting this situation before the Committee I have to call attention to the fact that paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) contains the further provision that during the three months no rent shall have been paid. That may be a not inconsiderable safeguard. I admit it. Yet one has to consider the elderly lady or gentleman living alone and who has gone to visit, say a son who lives in the north of England; or perhaps an elderly tenant has had a nervous breakdown and has been in some establishment for recovery, which takes a considerable time. The net result in that kind of case may be that the tenant loses his home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason we seek to enlarge the period from three months to 12 months in order to provide a more effective safeguard, without departing very much from the purpose of the Clause. We want to protect the tenant who had no intention of giving up premises and who has been absent for three months, perhaps for reasons of ill-health and in which, perhaps through a misunderstanding, no rent has been paid. Perhaps the tenant had not got the rent. The Clause should be recast in the way we indicate in our Amendment, and I would press that point upon the Home Secretary and ask him to accept it. If he thinks that 12 months is too long, perhaps he will suggest an alternative period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 52 had its origin in a case drawn to the attention of the Minister of Housing and Local Government by the hon. Member for Devonport (Mr. Foot). To get the Clause into perspective I should indicate the difficulty with which it is intended to deal. The case was in relation to blitzed property, not occupied under written tenancy agreements. There may well have been in many cases no power for the landlord to terminate the tenancy, owing to the disappearance of the tenant. One difficulty has been that the tenant might come back and claim to be the tenant, even though the premises had been rearranged and redeveloped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is provision in the Law of Property Act for the termination of a written tenancy agreement by the exhibition of a notice on the property, but that does
	<span class='label label-info column'>2776</span>
not apply to the case of an oral letting. It is to deal with this kind of letting that the Clause has been inserted. Perhaps I need not go more into detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would point out to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that there are very stringent conditions before the court can make its order. The landlord has no power to serve a notice to quit if the tenant is not in arrear with rent and is paid up to date. Before the court can make an order it has to be satisfied that the landlord has taken all reasonable steps to get into touch with the tenant In the instances given by the right hon. and learned Gentleman of people temporarily absent through illness or circumstances of that sort, there would be very little risk if reasonable steps were taken to find them. The landlord would then not be brought into contact with these difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the Clause could be interpreted to mean that the landlord had to make just one attempt to communicate during the period of three months. The court would require to be satisfied that he had taken all reasonable steps to do so. The court has discretion in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The short point raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman is whether the period of non-occupation ending with the date of the application should be more than three months. If during that period the landlord has tried to communicate with the tenant, should he have the right to serve a notice to quit? It does not seem that any great advantage would be gained by extending the period to six months or 12 months. While I appreciate the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument, my first impression is that the mere extension of time would not have very much value in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will certainly give further consideration to the point. I hope that I have been able to satisfy the right hon. and learned Gentleman that his fears that during the temporary absence of a tenant the county court will make an order, are unlikely to be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county court judge will have to be satisfied (
	<i>a</i>) that the landlord has the right to serve notice to quit if he can find his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I1398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2777</span>
tenant, (
	<i>b</i>) that he has made all reasonable efforts to find the tenant, and (
	<i>c</i>) that there has been a period of non-occupation ending with the date of the application to the county court. There is still discretion left with the county court judge, who might well say, depending on the facts of the case, "You ought to take this further step before I make an order." I am not sure whether any advantage is to be gained by extending the period beyond three months, but we will certainly give further consideration to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General has said that he will give further consideration to the point, and thus I am content to leave the matter as it is. I would again call his attention to the fact that in a case such as where a father living in the South of England went to stay with his son in the North of England—people in humble circumstances—the three months period might give rise to an accident. I do not press it further than that because the Solicitor-General has said that he will seriously consider the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would, however, press upon him that the Clause, even with the safeguards which he has indicated, would be much safer, and would achieve the purpose which the Government have in mind, if the period were prolonged not necessarily to 12 months but, at any rate, considerably beyond the present period. On the undertaking that further consideration will be given to the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the Motion with a view to moving another Motion which I did not move earlier in response to the request of the right hon. and learned Gentleman, "That the Bill be taken into further consideration this day at Half-past Four o'clock."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appear to be two points outstanding. One is the local authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>2778</span>
point of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffmgton). I have considered the matter very carefully, but I am not in a position to accept the provision for certification by a clerk to a local authority instead of a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I cannot accept the actual form of the Amendment by the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) relating to the National Trust, I am prepared to do something to meet the position of the Trust, and I will do that on the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington wishes to develop the local authority point further. If not, we might finish the Clauses now, but if he does, I must ask the Committee to sit this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Soskice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one starts discussing procedure, one always loses valuable time which could be better occupied. I cannot help thinking that the Home Secretary is being a little unreasonable. He has addressed to my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Skeffington) a question which it is for my hon. Friend to answer We have reached Clause 53, and, therefore, not much remains. We have made good progress this morning. Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman really want to sit this afternoon? If he does, my hon. Friends may feel bound, in view of the attitude previously adopted, not to oppose him, because he gave us warning earlier that he would move the Motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether that is so or not, I ask him to appreciate that we are near the end of the Bill. We have discussed the Sixth Schedule in connection with Clause 42. I hope he will think that it is not necessary to sit this afternoon, for that would occasion inconvenience to a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman persists, it must be a matter for him to put to the Committee. However, I hope that he will say that the progress which we have made so far, and which we may be able to make by one o'clock, is not disappointing from his point of view, and that he might let the Committee take its ordinary course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Some important points of principle, however, are concerned, particularly as in some respects the Clause imposes a new limitation on local authority powers. I should have thought it right and proper that those who feel keenly about it should be able to put that point of view to the Government, but the way in which the Home Secretary has put it is rather like holding a pistol to my head. It is, in effect, saying that, if I want to have the principle discussed, everybody must come back here this afternoon, and that puts me in a spot. I feel that the matter could be dealt with fairly quickly the next time the Committee sits, probably in half-an-hour, and we should then finish the Clauses.

	<p>about midday, most of the speeches this morning have come from the other side of the Committee, and many of the Amendments have been in the names of hon. Members opposite. The Opposition have undoubtedly tried to help the Home Secretary expedite consideration of the Bill this morning. A number of my hon. Friends will find it difficult to be here this afternoon.</p>

	<p>As some hon. Members who have other engagements, and as we have made enormous progress this morning and there is only one outstanding matter on the one Clause still to be considered, I think I might say, without making any threats, that the Home Secretary will find that if he meets us now the further progress of the Bill in Committee will be much smoother than it might otherwise be. I hope that the Home Secretary will decide that it is worth while not to meet this afternoon in the sure and certain knowledge that the only outstanding point before we finish the Clauses is that relating to local authorities, which could quickly be considered when we meet on Tuesday morning.</p>
