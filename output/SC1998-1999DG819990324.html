	<div class='legislation'>Traffic Areas (Reorganisation) (Wales) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Traffic Areas (Reorganisation) (Wales) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The order's purpose is to create a new Welsh traffic area to replace existing arrangements, under which north Wales is part of the north-western traffic area and south Wales is a separate traffic area. It may help if I explain the reason for the change, who it will affect, and how.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of administration of goods and public services vehicle licensing systems and the registration of scheduled bus services outside London, Great Britain is divided into eight traffic areas. Licences are granted by traffic commissioners appointed to those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a number of reviews into the licensing system and its administration. In 1991, the number of traffic areas was reduced from 11 to eight. In 1995, an efficiency scrutiny recommended that the number be reduced to six. The previous Government decided to close the traffic area offices in Cardiff and Manchester as a cost-cutting measure and to restructure the traffic area boundaries. They decided that the south Wales traffic area would be administered from Birmingham, and the north-west traffic area from Leeds. The traffic commissioner for the north-eastern traffic area was also appointed to the north-west traffic area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The efficiency scrutiny stressed the need for modern information systems. In 1996, it was announced that restructuring of traffic area boundaries would be suspended while further work was done on computer systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was clear when we took office that major investment would be needed to replace and modernise the obsolete information system and working practices. The work will take some time to complete; restructuring the boundaries could be some years away. Therefore, we decided to introduce proposals for a traffic area for Wales in advance of any wider restructuring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes will affect operators, who will have to obtain a licence. A licence will be issued for operators in each traffic area in which they have an operating centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned new information technology. Can she say how money is being invested in it, from whose budget the money will come and when it will be fully operational?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A study is taking place into the issues that the hon. Gentleman raises. The desired outcome is that such systems should offer flexibility. They will inherently provide a much better service, not only to operators but to traffic commissioners when they issue licences. I am unable to give figures now, but I shall inquire into the detail and write to the hon. Gentleman and all members of the Committee when I have the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that operators must have a licence for each traffic area in which they have an operating centre. They must specify centres and state how many vehicles will be kept at each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They must also inform the Traffic Commissioner of registration marks and changes of vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order makes detailed provision for dealing with licences affected by the boundary changes, to ensure a smooth transition and continuity of traffic commissioner functions and responsibilities. Broadly, the order provides that, on reorganisation, a former south Wales traffic area licence becomes a Welsh traffic area licence; a north-western traffic area licence, which specifies only operating centres in Wales, becomes a Welsh traffic area licence; and a north-western traffic area licence, which specifies operating centres in both England and Wales will be split, in consultation with the licence holder, to create a Welsh traffic area licence for the operating centre and vehicles based in Wales and an amended north-western traffic area licence for the operating centres and vehicles based in England. Where, as a consequence, an operator has two Welsh traffic area licences, those will be amalgamated in due course—we estimate within five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A consultation exercise was carried out with the industries concerned and a wide range of other interested parties in England and Wales. Most operators will be unaffected because they hold only one licence, which will fall within the new boundary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the new arrangements, if the traffic commissioner for the Welsh traffic area is the person who immediately before the reorganisation was traffic commissioner for south Wales, will road haulage operators in north Wales have to refer to Cardiff with respect to their licences?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall be touching on that issue later in my remarks, but the administration will, as now, operate from the office in Birmingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the administrative headquarters will be in Birmingham. Is that for North and south Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am sure my hon. Friend is aware, we are discussing an order that will make one traffic area for Wales, combining north and south Wales. At the moment, the separate north Wales traffic area is administered from the north-western traffic area, namely the office in Leeds. The south Wales traffic area is, I believe, administered from the office in Birmingham. The new all-Wales traffic area will be administered from the office in Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The effect on staffing in the traffic area offices will be minor—equivalent to two posts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not detect some irony in the fact that she is announcing streamlining to put matters under one-Wales auspices, but that the headquarters will be in Birmingham? What would she say to the suggestion that the headquarters for the all-Wales area should be based in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that issue will be examined after the study on the modernisation of the computer system to which I referred. What I find truly ironic is that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) should have asked that question, in the light of the fact that it was a previous Conservative Administration who split up Wales in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioner for the west midlands and south Wales traffic areas will retain responsibility for the west midlands traffic area. His responsibilities for south Wales will be extended to all of Wales. If our proposal for a Welsh traffic area is approved, it is, as I have said, intended that it should be run from Birmingham, which already deals with the larger number of operators based in Wales. However, when a traffic commissioner decides to hold a public inquiry, for example, it will always be held locally—either by the commissioner or his deputies. One of the deputies for the Wales traffic area is a Welsh speaker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order amends the Traffic Areas (Reorganisation) Order 1990 by defining the limits of the north-western traffic area to exclude the former counties of Clwyd and Gwynedd and to include their areas in the new all-Wales traffic area. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first give the apologies of my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) who, as a result of the change to today's business, has to be on the Front Bench to resume the debate where it broke off for the Adjournment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, with respect, there was the smallest error in naming my hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Townend), who is listed as Mr. Tony Townend on the Committee membership list? That has now been corrected by the Private Bill Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister confirmed our worst fears: that this is principally a politically correct measure. I have the distinct impression from listening to the Minister's logic in explaining the change that it is a chicken-and-egg case. Unless I am much mistaken, the initial changes to the traffic area boundaries were defended on the basis of efficiency. The administration centres were relocated to places such as Birmingham and Leeds for reasons of efficiency. Yet, the traffic areas are once again being re-ordered in advance of a study on the future location of an administrative centre. Will consideration be given in that study to increased efficiency and cost savings or to additional costs caused by the changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are principally worried about a small group of people who will undoubtedly be losers as a result of the changes. Will the Minister say how many people will now
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
have to buy two licences who previously had to buy only one? The economy of north Wales is always orientated towards the north-west and the businesses in north-west Wales naturally orientate towards Manchester. Therefore, the creation of an artificial boundary within which a second licence must now be purchased will add an extra £680 to the costs of those businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say how many of those affected are truckers? I cannot resist saying that the haulage industry is seriously affected by other changes that the Government have made. The price of diesel fuel has been increased by 12 per cent, and the vehicle excise duty for 38-tonne trucks is not only the highest in Europe, but more than twice the European average. The same people will have to face a considerable extra burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Constituency is close enough to Birmingham for me to appreciate that the Government's decision to retain the administrative centre for the new traffic area there will guarantee jobs for which some of my constituents may be grateful. However, it seems curious, as the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) logically said, that the administrative centre is not located within the new traffic area, particularly as Cardiff was used as the administrative centre for the previous traffic area. We therefore join the hon. Gentleman in asking the Minister to reconsider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know what the Government's primary motivation is for the order. We want to be reassured that it is not simply a matter of political correctness, but that efficiency and savings will result from reviewing the areas. We want the Minister to accept that this is a chicken-and-egg solution where—to use another idiom——the cart has been put before the horse before a proper study of the benefits of such changes has been carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am flattered by Conservative support for my ideas. I was just trying to elucidate matters. I am a completely subservient support of the Government and I will vote with them today. I am sure that the Whip will be pleased about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the idea of devolving government to Wales, yet it is a contradiction for the traffic headquarters to be outside Wales. The sooner the Government get to grips with the situation, the better. We are protective about our institutions in Wales. I gather that the traffic commission—and traffic commissioners—is made up of civil servants. I am sure that the Welsh Assembly will want to turn it into a quango as soon as possible. I noticed in 
	<i>The Western Mail</i> today that Welsh mafia connections and the necessity of finding jobs for the boys and girls were mentioned. The line was that all would be grateful if we had a traffic quango in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell Conservative Members who are now smiling, that their support for hauliers is well founded. Those who represented mining constituencies during the last miners' strike will be aware that it turned vicious as a result of the Conservative Government's use of hauliers to break the strike. The Tory Government allowed the traffic commissioners to let the hauliers break the law by forming convoys on motorways, which created much fear among ordinary users of the roads. Bringing in lorry drivers and hauliers left a very bitter taste in the valleys
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of south Wales, so I am not surprised that the Opposition are paying off their debt by their hypocritical support for truckers and hauliers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making a party political point. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that I am making a serious point and that I was not even a Member of Parliament during the period to which he refers, which is why I am concentrating on the present. The road safety issue that he raised in relation to hauliers is important. People who abide by the rules in the haulage industry are being put out of business by cowboys who break the rules: the road safety issue is a genuine concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be short. I must also tell the hon. Member for Rhondda that we are debating the Traffic Areas (Reorganisation) (Wales) Order 1999 and that he will want to debate its provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mr. Jones. I mentioned the behaviour of hauliers during the miners' strike because they were actively encouraged by the Government and traffic commissioners turned a blind eye to people who were wilfully contravening their licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should, in time, be a separate quango in Wales but, as I said, I have an odd feeling about the headquarters being based outside Wales. I am sure that our friend in Plaid Cymru will support me on that matter. I can already see him turning purple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.49 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make a brief contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Welsh traffic area—such a development is proper and logical. I assume that the centre in Birmingham will be an interim arrangement, but I am alarmed that that may last for five years. Haulage firms in Wales may be enormously inconvenienced if they have to communicate with Birmingham all the time. I assume that the centre will eventually be located in Wales once the consultation is concluded and has been duly considered. It is essential that Wales has its own centre, which should be accessible to all. It should be accessible physically and by information technology as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument, although his logic seems to suggest an operating centre for an all-Wales traffic area would be appropriately located in Wales. However, his argument is countered by the fact that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is situated in Swansea and operates for the whole of the United Kingdom. People living in Scotland or England must get in touch with Swansea. What is the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. However, we are talking about two different matters. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency covers the whole of the United Kingdom, whereas the Wales traffic area covers Wales. Therefore, the centre must be in Wales and must be accessible to all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I am pleased that the Minister said that all tribunals, for example, will take place in Wales. People outside Wales underestimate its size. The county of Powys, for example, would stretch from the Severn bridge to the Hammersmith flyover, if it were in southern England. Therefore, it is important that the office should be established in Wales and in an accessible location.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about Brecon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not go into that, although the hon. Gentleman may have a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The office will deal with public service vehicle licenses. There will be a lot of paperwork and, sometimes, people from businesses will have to go there to sort things out. Going to Birmingham would be a huge inconvenience. Therefore, I trust that the centre will not be in Birmingham for five years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is a Welsh location that is as accessible as Birmingham? Those living in north Wales find mid-Wales and South Wales inaccessible and vice versa. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us where he would locate the centre?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is leading me astray. It is said that Llandrindod Wells in my constituency is equally inconvenient to everyone. People often meet there because most places in Wales are equidistant to it.

The haulage industry has had a difficult time with the cost of fuel and licences. Getting people to travel additional distances to Birmingham is wrong. We therefore wish the centre to be located in Wales as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) wished to know the primary reasons for the measure. We are moving towards a situation in which Wales becomes a significant entity and reaches a level for all kinds of administration and services. That is what devolution is about. The National Assembly of Wales will organise more and more functions for Wales. In a small way, history is being written. Naturally, I am delighted that things are moving in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The location of the office is vitally important. I reiterate that I, along with the vast majority of people in Wales, believe that the bureaucratic administration should be located in Wales. Some Members take pleasure in the fact that connections in Wales are less convenient than those from certain parts of Wales to England. I take no pleasure in that. I want a consolidation of Wales and of its communications, including transport and electronic communications, which should be used to establish the integrity of Wales as a national territory. We look forward to that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden made a perfectly valid point about hauliers who will have to pay for two licences. There must be a way round this. Surely it must be possible to have a concession for people with headquarters in Wales and England. I agree that we ought to try to

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
minimise costs. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister can foresee a way of minimising costs by not requiring people to have two licences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Powell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ogmore)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister address her thoughts to the matters that most speeches cover—the location of the headquarters? It might be an idea for her to remember that come 7 May there will be an elected Assembly. Indeed, in all probability those Members of Parliament from Wales who are not seeking election to the Assembly will have time on their hands to help her to locate the headquarters in some other area. I can see the reaction from the elected Welsh Members once they find that the headquarters will not be either in Cardiff or elsewhere in Wales. It would probably be wiser for her to reconsider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all appreciate the comments that have been made and that the decisions have been made to make savings and for administrative and other reasons. The Assembly will be based in Cardiff, but the regional committees will be outside Cardiff and so we must look at the structure that has already been agreed for the Welsh Assembly before making definite decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has my hon. Friend given any thought to training for young people in transport reorganisation matters? What are the chances that, as a result of the order, Wales would be considered for a fairer share of objective 1? That might be outside the order, but it involves training. In all probability my hon. Friend could put that the reorganisation into the notes and enhance our chances of obtaining grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will briefly touch on some of the issues raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. The hon. Member for Meriden spoke about restructuring. The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Sir R. Powell) spoke about the siting of the office of the new Wales traffic area in Wales. As I have already pointed out, the Department is engaged in a wide-ranging study of the modernisation of the computer systems. It is hoped that these systems will ensure a much more efficient service to the operators and, indeed, from the traffic commissioner. Once that study is completed and a wider consideration of the system to be used has begun, we will examine the possibility of siting the office for the Welsh traffic area in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerns were also expressed about the additional burden that might be placed on hauliers by the creation of a Welsh traffic area, and the hon. Members for Meriden and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) referred to the fuel duty escalator. That was introduced by the previous Administration and was welcomed by this Government as a major contribution to ensuring that we meet our national and international commitments to reduce the amount of pollution in the air with the concomitant deleterious effect from greenhouse gases and global warming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Opposition Members do the haulage industry no favours by persisting in the fallacious statement that, because costs in the United Kingdom are high, our
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
hauliers face undue burdens of competition. A report issued yesterday by KPMG shows that overall costs fore the haulage industry in the UK are the second lowest in Europe. Only Austria has lower costs, if a haulage company in this county were to set up in France, Belgium or the Netherlands, the overall costs would be more than £500,000 in France, more than £600,00 in the Netherlands and about £800,000 in Belgium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Spelman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends which category of truck we are dealing with. Will the Minsiter give serious consideration to a transitional period while the study is being conducted for those who currently operate with one licence and will now have to have two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to come on to licences in response to a question from hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was referring to the fuel duty escalator. It is fallacious to say that costs in this country are overburdensome to our haulage industry and make it difficult for them to compete with companies on the mainland of Europe. That is disproven by the fact that haulage companies from the mainland are moving to the United Kingdom to gain the benefits of our lower corporation tax and social costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire and for Meriden referred to restructuring and the hon. Gentleman mentioned inconvenience. Restructuring took place in 1995. In a cost-cutting exercise, the previous Administration split Wales into the south Wales and north Wales traffic areas. Northern Wales was subsumed into the north-west traffic area and was administered from Leeds. The south Wales traffic area was administered from Birmingham. We are creating, if the Committee agrees, a Wales traffic area. The two areas will be combined and the administration will be from one office, in Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no need to travel for routine traffic area business. Public inquiries to which operators are called, either for disciplinary reasons or to hear objections from residents to the granting of a licence, are held in Wales. Since the offices in Cardiff and Manchester were closed, there has been a total of 106 public inquiries involving operators and drivers in Wales, 97 of which were held in Cardiff, three in Manchester, three in Llandudno, two in Wrexham and one in Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden was concerned about the fees and the number of operators who would be affected. About 1,707 good and 130 public service vehicle operators will have their licences transferred from the north-western traffic area to the new Welsh traffic area; 5,748 goods and 477 public service operators in south Wales will have their licences transferred to the new area, creating a combined total of 8,062 operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fewer than 200 of those will need an additional licence or two Welsh traffic area licences—the latter will have to be amalgamated. The amount of vehicle fees payable by operators will not change. In cases in which an additional licence is needed, an additional licence fee will be payable in due course. The current licence fee for a five-year period is £250 for a goods vehicle operator's licence and £100 for a public service vehicle operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have touched on all the questions raised by Committee members, with the possible exception of that asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda. I apologise for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
leaving him until last. My hon. Friend was anxious about the traffic commissioners, defining them as civil servants. However, the commissioners would object strongly to that definition. They belong to a statutorily independent public body and they are recruited through open competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made an important point about haulage operators' potentially illegal activities, which was picked up by the hon. Member for Meriden. There can be no excuse for illegal activity based on the haulage industry's economic burdens and I am sure that the hon. Lady did not intend to justify such activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can reassure hon. Members about the action that the Government will take with regard to operators who conduct illegal operations. Such action is additional to the measure, which will impact on such operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the White Paper, "Integrated Transport Policy", we announced our intention to proceed with a detention scheme for illegally operated heavy goods vehicles. Detaining such vehicles will be the first truly effective sanction against unlicensed operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A practical scheme has been devised, the details of which have been discussed and agreed with industry. Enforcement of the rules on drivers' hours will be tightened by a Bill, which Earl Attlee announced in the transport debate that took place in the House of Lords on 27 January The Government will support that Bill, which is being drafted and which will shortly be introduced in the House of Lords. Our overriding priority is safety on our roads, whatever the form of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The hon. Member for Meriden asked whether the creation of a Welsh traffic area was simply an exercise in political correctness. The previous Government gave an undertaking to create a Welsh traffic area office. This Government, however, have made that promise come true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the traffic commissioners' office was in Cardiff, there was fairly effective policing of people with heavy goods vehicle and public service vehicle licences. Some of us suspect that many firms with contracts for school buses, for example, are not up to standard. Will the Minister assure us that, under the reorganisation of traffic areas, such operators will be effectively policed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly reassure my hon. Friend that I will bring his concern——which is shared by other hon. Members—to the attention of the traffic commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will touch on whether there will be concessionary fees for people who require two licences. The answer is no. The cost of the five-year licence will be £250, which is the equivalent of £50 a year for a heavy goods vehicle. Having a transitional period would increase costs to operators because there would be administrative complications. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
