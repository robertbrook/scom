	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Draft Education (Student Support) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. George Mudie)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Education (Student Support) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Education (Student Loans) (Scotland) Regulations 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is with some trepidation that I rise to address the Committee. My predecessor from the Welsh valleys, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), who is now Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, introduced similar regulations on 28 July last year, and he was removed from the Department for Education and Employment on the same day. I do not know whether there will be a vote on my performance at the end of our proceedings, but I shall be diligent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two sets of regulations will give effect to our proposals for student support for those who will enter higher education in 1999–2000, and for those who have entered, or will enter, in 1998–99. Parallel regulations for Northern Ireland will be made shortly, and they will cover the same ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significant difference between the two sets of regulations is that those for England and Wales cover both grants and loans, whereas those for Scotland cover only loans. Existing regulations made under the same legislation cover the payment of grants in Scotland, and they will remain in force. The two sets of regulations are designed to have the same effect for loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Education (Student Support) Regulations were tabled on 4 February and the draft Education (Student Loans) (Scotland) Regulations were tabled on 8 February. They have been considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a lively and interesting debate in Committee last July because the regulations then under consideration dealt with a new policy. I say with some hope that today is not the time to go over that ground again. Over the past six months we have consulted wildly—
	<i>[Laughter]</i>—wildly, as well as widely—on the technical aspects of implementing the policy set out in the regulations now before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations relate to the academic year 1999–2000. They will apply to students who enter higher education during that year and to those who
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
enter during the 1998–99 transitional year. They will not apply to students who enter higher education before 1998–99, or to those who entered in 1998–99 but for whom exceptional arrangements were made. Those students will continue to be subject to the previous arrangements, and we will shortly introduce regulations on mandatory awards and student loans that will govern those arrangements for the coming year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keeping their promise to students and their families. We are increasing the resources available to all students for their living costs by 2.5 per cent., in line with forecast inflation. We are honouring our pledge that students' families will not be expected to contribute any more in real terms towards living costs than under the old mandatory awards regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increases apply equally to existing students who continue under the old mandatory awards arrangements and to new students who in 1999–2000 will be eligible for 100 per cent. loans. The same rules for parental contribution will apply to both groups of students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Students to whom the regulations apply will be eligible to receive a loan towards their living costs and a grant towards the cost of tuition fees. The maximum full-year loan for a student living in London will be £4,480 and the maximum contribution towards tuition fees will be £1,025. Those whose circumstances are exceptional—for example, disabled students and those who have dependants—will continue to be eligible for supplementary allowances in the form of grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will provide for the payment of loans and supplementary grants for living costs, and for grants towards tuition fees. Provision for the repayment of loans will be dealt with in a further set of regulations to be made later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations deal with eligibility, the amount of loan available, grants towards tuition fees and supplementary grants towards living costs. They deal with the application process that students should follow, the financial assessment of the level of support to which students will be entitled, and arrangements for paying support to students in instalments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key feature of the regulations for England and Wales is that they bring together for the first time provisions for the payment of all types of higher education student support. We have simplified and aligned the different criteria that applied in the past to student loans and to mandatory awards. The result is a set of arrangements that will be clear and transparent for students and for those who administer the arrangements—local authorities, the Student Loans Company and higher education institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities will be the first port of call for all students wishing to apply for support. Local education authorities will assess each student's application to determine the amount of support to which the student is entitled. They will notify the student of the result and, at the same time, notify the Student Loans Company, which will make payments to students. Higher education institutions will be responsible for confirming the students' attendance and for handing over the first payment. Our aim is that all students will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
receive payment by the first day of term, and thereafter in termly instalments. Students must play their part in the arrangements by meeting the deadlines that we have set for making applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue may take up less time if the Minister responds to a question straight away. Although the regulations clearly state that there will be penalties for students who fail to submit the information within the set time, there is no obligation on the Student Loans Company or the LEAs to perform. Although the idea seems to be that the Student Loans Company will process cases within one month, the regulations will not oblige it to do so. Is that an omission, or will the Government set out clear statutory requirements for the Student Loans Company and the LEAs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentions penalties for students. No one is anxious to impose such penalties. However, students may impose penalties on themselves if they do not meet the deadlines. The situation will be much easier to assess, to administer and to pay for if the deadlines are met. We will then be able to assess the performance of local authorities, the Student Loans Company and the other relevant institutions. However, if the students do not meet the deadlines, there will be problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some excitement surrounding the Student Loans Company during the past year, but— without wishing to be accused of complacency—we think that the record is not bad, with 97 per cent. of cases being dealt with on time. Only one application in 5,000 has had a problem. The regulations will make it easier for all the participants. We are willing to let the new arrangements run, and we hope that with streamlining and clear deadlines, if everyone plays their part, we shall not have problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The different legislation and administration arrangements in Scotland mean that the various adjustments to eligibility can be achieved within the terms of the existing grant regulations that—like the regulations for Scotland that we are considering— were made under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. Similarly, the centralised administrative arrangements that already exist in Scotland will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consulted on the policy and administrative procedures reflected in the regulations with key representative organisations, such as the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, the Local Government Association and the National Union of Students—the latter being a particular favourite of the Opposition. Those organisations have helped us to ensure that the technical aspects of the regulations are right, and we are most grateful for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some new features, to which I draw the Committee's attention. Our aim is to widen access to higher education, and the regulations contain policy measures to help to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) will be pleased to hear that we have extended loans to students aged under 55 at the start of their course, who intend to enter employment after completing it. That fulfils the pledge
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
that the Secretary of State made last June— 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is nothing to do with my hon. Friend's age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This change in parliamentary etiquette is most interesting. Is it now the official policy of Labour Members to call Liberal Democrat Members their hon. Friends?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In certain circumstances, even the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) could become my hon. Friend. That is an example of the spirit of inclusion; perhaps it offends the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If some Opposition Members are the Minister's hon. Friends, will he advise us whether they should be sitting on the Government Benches?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have never objected to hon. Members crossing the Floor. They can do that any time that they wish. We might feel some trepidation about the prospect of certain hon. Members crossing the Floor, but they have not done so yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extension of loans to those under 55 fulfils the pledge that the Secretary of State made last June. It is a welcome extension, and will be of real benefit to those wishing to retrain or to develop new skills at that stage in their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also introducing a new allowance of up to £100 per week for students who enter higher education after having been in care, and who pay housing costs in the long vacation. Such students have often found it difficult to find a place to live in the long summer vacations. It is usually impossible for them to stay with their parents or to look to them for help and support. We are determined not to let those few students down as they seek to improve their lives and job prospects through higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We announced last month that from autumn 2000, part-time higher education students on a low income will for the first time be entitled to loans of at least £500 to help with the costs of their courses. We will allocate £30 million to support the new loans from 2000 to 2002. The loans for new and existing part-time students on a low income will help with their course expenses, such as books and equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, £5 million has been allocated for the 1999–2000 academic year to enable fees to be waived for those starting undergraduate courses while in receipt of benefits. Similar sums will be made available for subsequent years. The money will be available to existing as well as new students engaged in part-time undergraduate study towards a first degree, an HNC, an HND or other undergraduate credit-bearing higher education provision funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. In that case, "part-time" means at least 50 per cent. of a full-time course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to make clear to the Committee our position on an issue in the regulations that I know has caused concern. Last week, the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities, which is known as Skill, made representations to us about the effect of the regulations on disabled students over 50. Although we have extended loans to certain students between 50
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
and 55, the effect of the regulations is that students who do not qualify for support towards living costs will not in future qualify for disabled students' allowances. I assure the Committee that the Government have heard those concerns sympathetically. We are clear that we wish disabled students to continue to receive support towards costs arising from their disability. We are considering how best to achieve that, and we will explore the options with Skill and announce our plans soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those few remarks, I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.44 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Damian Green 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his comments, and I assure him that if I do not congratulate him further, it will be out of compassion. I, like him, remember the last time that such regulations were discussed in a Standing Committee. I remember congratulating not only his predecessor but a previous Minister of State at the Scottish Office on keeping their jobs. Both of them nodded in assent, but we all know what happened later that day. It proved that times move on, and that 45 minutes is a long time in politics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put the England and Wales regulations in context before asking the Minister detailed questions, and then moving on to the Scottish regulations. I speak more in sorrow that anything else, because the regulations implement a system that betrays the Government's supposed commitment to lifelong learning. The figures tell their own story. Applications are down 1.8 per cent. in total, and applications from the over-25s are down by 10 per cent. Those statistics clearly show that mature students know about the problems of debt and that they do not trust the Government figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that students would not have to contribute any more than before. The clear evidence of students' behaviour since the introduction of the system shows that they do not believe the Government. If lifelong learning is to become more than a slogan, mature students should be specifically encouraged, not discouraged. The Committee will be interested to hear the Minister's proposals for such students, because the regulations clearly discourage applications from that age group. As the Opposition have said, it would have been better if the Government had not rejected the Dearing report but had implemented its recommendations, which included continuation of the maintenance grant as it was. That recommendation was unexpected, but Conservative Members would have accepted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked the Minister several questions about the matter. He has answered that the planned student numbers underlying the funding plans for higher education are not disaggregated by age group. Perhaps they should be, because the chance of increasing the number of mature students is in danger of being lost. I urge him to carry out a full-scale review of funding, especially for the higher age groups. Without such a
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
review, there is the danger of losing some of the gains made during the past few years in ensuring greater access, especially for mature students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned several of the organisations that have taken a natural interest in the matter, including the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. Regulation 20 concerns hardship, and he will know that that committee has expressed specific reservations about the hardship loans scheme, whose administration is proving complex. It has argued that the scheme is unlikely to secure the Government's objective of supporting the most financially needy students, and that universities are concerned that the requirement to apply for a hardship loan before applying for access funds may deter students who have already taken out maintenance loans. It has advocated the amalgamation of hardship loans with access funds. Will the Minister comment on that idea?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was also kind enough to point out that relations between the Conservative party and the NUS are rather better than they used to be. I am pleased about that, and was pleased to speak about the issue before us from an NUS platform a few months ago. [
	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Oh."] I regret to say that no Minister felt it possible to step on to that platform. Unlike the Minister, I will not call the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough my hon. Friend, because I do not want to discuss that issue again. However, the hon. Gentleman too, spoke from the platform that day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most eloquently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Green</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I missed the hon. Gentleman's undoubtedly eloquent contribution. It is sad that Ministers can no longer bring themselves to speak to the National Union of Students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NUS has said that the £250 hardship loans will not alleviate the problem of student proverty. Because of the small number who will be eligible, hardship loans will act as little more than a sticking plaster. What kind of hardship does the Minister think that he will alleviate, given those numbers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already touched on regulations 19 and 24. We need specifically to consider the balance of obligation between students and authorities as regards filling in forms correctly and on time. The Minister said that he was confident that local authorities and the Student Loans Company could cope well. He will be aware that many of those on the receiving end of the system have rather less confidence. I would be grateful if he could give us a concrete reassurance about whether the performance of local authorities and of the Student Loans Company will improve.

I asked the Minister on a previous occasion how many UK students had not, by 21 October, been assessed for liability to pay tuition fees, but he said that the information was not collected centrally. Given the amount of unnecessary information that the Department for Education and Employment collects from institutions of learning, it is bizarre that it does not collect centrally local authority information on liability to pay tuition fees. If it did, the Minister could speak with some authority about whether LEAs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
provide a good service to students from their areas. As the Minister said in a written answer that the Government do not collect the information centrally, I am not clear how he can tell us that everything is going well; to judge by his own words, he cannot know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also legitimate concern about the bureaucracy and expenses required to means-test non-UK students from the European Union. By the middle of October, the Government had spent £327,000 on such assessments. That does not sound like a lot, but it could provide a lot of hardship loans at £250 a throw. That is another part of the system that has become severely bureaucratic, and one hopes that it will be radically improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with regulation 12, the Minister referred to older students. I am enchanted that the Secretary of State will be able to give grants and loans to those in the relevant age group if they intend to seek employment. How will he know whether they do? Clearly, people will declare that they are, but what checking mechanism will be in place? The provision is a potential loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, there is potential in regulation 10(8) for grants for repeat periods during a course. On what criteria will the Secretary of State decide who is eligible? Will he devolve the relevant power to local authorities or to higher education institutions? It will be interesting to know who will take the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one or two points about the Scottish regulations. Both the Under-Secretary of State and the Minister for Education, Scottish Office will be aware of the most recent figures, which show that applications to Scottish universities from Scotland are down 5.9 per cent. The figures from the rest of the UK are especially worrying. Applications to Scottish universities from England are down by 6.5 per cent., those from Wales are down by 12.8 per cent., and those from Northern Ireland are down by 4 per cent. That contrasts starkly with applications from students from elsewhere in the European Union, who, because of legal requirements, enjoy benefits that non-Scottish UK students do not. Applications from the EU are, understandably, down by only 1.7 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can confirm that the Quigley committee will take those figures seriously in assessing the effect of the changes, and that either he or the Minister for Education, Scottish Office will commend the Saltire scholarship scheme, which was proposed by the Scottish Conservative party. That scheme would simplify the life of Scottish students much more than the regulations will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sets of regulations are bureaucratic and damaging. They are already putting off potential students, and will therefore harm the cause of lifelong learning. It is regrettable that the Government intend to introduce them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as possible, and shall not refer to matters that were raised by the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). Liberal Democrat Members support most of the hon. Gentleman's comments, with the exception of those about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Dearing report. Our views on that differed fundamentally from those of the Conservative party and those of the Government. This is not the right place to return to that issue; indeed, you would not allow us to do so, Mr. Olner, because you are a sensible and wise Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr first point concerns the Student Loans Company. I wish that I could share the Minister's uncommon complacency about student loans, exemplified by his claim that 97 per cent. of students are entirely satisfied with the Student Loans Company and that only one student in 5,000 has a problem. That is not in line with the evidence that has emerged from the National Union of Students. There cannot be a member of the Committee who has not been lobbied by the NUS or by individual students about the problems that have arisen in connection with the Student Loans Company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Targets and penalties should be established for the company, and for local education authorities. The Minister did not address that issue directly, although he skirted round it. It is unacceptable that some students have to wait for more than three months to have a loan processed and that more than one in three students, according to the NUS, experiences problems in accessing loans or in having the LEA assess their eligibility for loans. Liberal Democrat Members would like targets to be set for both bodies. For LEAs, a four-week mandatory processing period should be required for establishing eligibility, and a period of about six weeks should be required for the statutory financial assessment by LEAs and the Student Loans Company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to say that students should be prompt in sending in their applications. It is unjustified for students to mess the Students Loans Company about, as the company exists only to serve them. However, every week that a student, especially a poor student, has to wait for a loan represents a week for which they have to seek resources elsewhere. The Barclays survey of student debt revealed that the vast majority of students—about 80 per cent.—take out other loans. Many of those borrowings are made in the early part of the year, when students are waiting for their loans to be processed by the Student Loans Company. If the performance of the company and the LEAs has not, within 12 months, radically improved and approached the four-week and six-week targets that I suggested, the Minister should consider introducing a regulation to ensure that it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations imply that unless strict criteria are observed, students will be charged twice if they change courses during the year. Regulation 7(1)(b) prescribes that a student can move university and course only on educational grounds. We understand the reason for that. However, the Minister well knows—he and I have worked together in the past, which is probably why he calls me a friend rather than a foe—that students need to move universities for a host of reasons, not just on educational grounds. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] These are desperate times. Perhaps the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Home Secretary's statement this afternoon has caused flutters about future assessments—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am glad that the Minister understands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many students have to change university for genuine non-educational reasons. For instance, it is pointless keeping a student at a university where he or she is unhappy. Many students who are going away for the first time—particularly 18-year-olds—feel the need to change; both the course and the university may well be unacceptable. The regulation prescribes that unless a student changes university on educational grounds and is backed up by the host university, he or she will have to pay fees again. Will the Minister reconsider that? Perhaps some clarification is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 10(1)(c) relates to field trips. The hon. Member for Ashford will remember that when we debated that important issue before, the right, hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) was precise about whether field trip expenses should be regarded as top-up fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A field trip is part and parcel of some courses. It seems incredible that the current schools regulations prevent schools from charging for field trips that are part of the curriculum, yet once students get to university, they will have to pay for field trips that are an essential part of a course, although they pay tuition fees, too. The regulation is precise about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens to poor students who have applied for additional funds of between £100 and £200 on hardship grounds? Most modern language degree courses entail study abroad, but according to regulation 10, the whole cost of that—including any fees—will have to be met by the student. There will be no point in poor students applying to do geology or archaelogy courses, for example, because they will have to meet all the additional costs without being able to get a loan. Perhaps there is a simple explanation; if so, I hope that the Minister will tell us what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 19(7) concerns another issue that we have raised before—loans being able to be paid on only two occasions. We were told that the Government would consider the matter. Most universities have three terms, so it would be logical for students to apply for part of their loan on a termly basis. We are, however, stuck with just the two occasions. Why has the Minister overlooked that issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Ashford mentioned the over-50s. It is unrealistic to expect people applying for loans to say what employment they will enter. They may to hope to follow a particular career, but it may be difficult to find such employment, and the assumption is that they will be penalised. I hope that the Minister will guarantee that students who apply for a loan on the basis of going into teaching or some other profession or career, but who do not do so, will not be penalised or have to repay the loan if they do not find work—exactly as 21-year-olds who leave university will not have to repay a loan until that start earning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made those few comments, I leave the Scottish regulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>5.4 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have half a dozen points to make about the Scottish regulations, and I should be obliged if the Minister would respond to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am concerned about regulation 5(2) (a), which covers students residing at a university. Developments in distance learning—especially at the university of the Highlands and Islands—may involve people living at home, and they may be disadvantaged by the regulations. Will the Minister give us an assurance? We may be looking ahead a little, but that may become an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two points to make in relation to the competence of students in dealing with their personal bureaucracy, about which I have some doubts. First, as has already been mentioned, under regulation 6(12), students must respond within one month. In my experience of organising students, a fair percentage of students are probably incapable of responding to anything within one month. Secondly, under regulation 9(2)(f), they are then supposed to tell the Secretary of State every time that they change either their student address or their permanent address, or change their telephone number. The mobility of students in Edinburgh causes me to doubt whether they will do so competently. Does the Minister have any observations on how the regulations will work, given that many students may not follow the letter of laws that they have never read?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn to what may be a more serious point, I am not clear about the wording of regulation 7. It often happens in Scotland—and it is a good thing—that a student starts at a further education college studying for an HNC or an HND and does sufficiently well to go on to university and complete a degree course, of which the year or two at college was effectively the first and second year. Will that still be counted as one degree? The wording could be construed as deeming the HNC or HND to be one course, and the degree a second course. That may be my misinterpretation, but I would like the position to be made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 10(4) makes provision for a student who does not live at home but whom the Secretary of State thinks could reasonably, be expected to live at home. That is a rather strange concept. The Secretary of State will make a judgment about a person's family life. There may be perfectly good reasons why a student whose home is in Edinburgh and who attends Edinburgh university lives in digs. The mechanism of granting loans should not interfere in that matter. That paragraph appears ill judged, but if I have misinterpreted it, I hope that the Minister will correct me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another family-related issue is raised by regulation 11(1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining the amount of a loan payable under these Regulations, the Secretary of State shall take account of</p></blockquote>
what the
	<br><blockquote><p>"student's parents and … spouse can reasonably be expected to contribute towards the eligible student's expenses."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Again, the Government are venturing into the family area. I can see some logic to means tests and so on in relation to grant, but where a loan is concerned, how a family organise their financial affairs is up to them. If parents or a spouse contribute, that is fine, but the Government should not be involved. I should like a response to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is an issue that is mentioned only in the explanatory notes, but should be dealt with elsewhere. Page 43 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is intended that regulations providing for the repayment of loans through the tax system will be made, and provision for repayment by persons not subject to that system will also be made."</p></blockquote>
I would be happier if we knew now, while debating the regulations, what sort of repayment regime will be in place. Many right hon. and hon. Members would find it unsatisfactory if a person were expected to start repaying the loan as soon as he or she started paying income tax—that is, while earning quite a low salary. I hope that the Minister can assure us that future regulations will be sympathetic and liberal with regard to when students start repaying their loan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would help the Committee if I took up the Scottish points, so that my hon. Friend can reply to the broader points that have been raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of issues have been raised in relation to Scotland, and I must admit that having spent a lot of time in this Room in a previous ministerial incarnation, I had not realised, until I came into Committee this afternoon, how much I missed it. In Scotland, the one thing that we do not see opposite us are members of the official Opposition. I had forgotten the sport that could be had in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman thinks that we should give it another couple of months. I was amused at his reference to the Saltire awards—the official Opposition's proposal to give bursaries to Scottish students, to be disbursed by Members of the Scottish Parliament. Despite that suggestion that Members of the Scottish Parliament would have dosh to hand out, the official Opposition managed to score only 9 per cent. in the most recent opinion poll. They will have to do slightly better than that, even with our very generous system of proportional representation, for any of them to sit in the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Green</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that we are not discussing the Scottish devolution Bill, Mr. Olner, because that is now the Scotland Act 1998. As a result of the Government's actions, a Scottish Parliament will be sitting in Scotland very shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member of Ashford referred to the most recent figures leaked from the Universities and Colleges Admission Service in relation to a reduction in applications at this time of year. This time last year, he and his colleagues were hyperventilating and scaremongering about the consequences of the Government's new arrangements for student support. Yet applications in Scotland were ultimately 4 per cent. up on the previous year. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman awaits the final outcome of the application process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the Quigley committee's deliberations on what has become known as the Scottish anomaly. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman checks the regulations; they deal with loans, and the Quigley committee is looking at the Scottish anomaly as it relates to tuition fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West made a number of specific points about the Scottish regulations. With regard to students who do not need to reside in a university, the hon. Gentleman made a good point about the university of the Highlands and Islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Lady reconsider what she has said to the hon. Member for Ashford? When students from English domiciles who attend Scottish universities have to apply for fees for the fourth year, will the Scottish Office pay those fees if they are fully remitted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is confusing the purpose of the regulations with the purpose of the Quigley committee. Sir George Quigley's committee was established to look at the impact of the fourth-year tuition fees.

Gentleman would like me to write to him about the Quigley committee, I should be happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I crave your indulgence, Mr. Olner, because I know that I am going off the point. Sir George Quigley's committee has now commenced its deliberations, but it will take time before we see the impact of the fourth-year anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Olner; I could not resist the temptation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the important point made by someone who knows the Scottish education system—the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West—about the university of the Highlands and Island. His point about the eligibility of students at UHI for loan facilities is well made, and is covered by the regulations. It is inevitable, given the nature of the university of the Highlands and Island and the exciting distance learning provision that it will make, that students will incur expenditure—in some instances, quite substantial expenditure. It would be ludicrous not to take that into account when UHI is designated as a university—a step that is not imminent but will, I hope, be taken soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point about students and personal bureaucracy. I respond to that with some feeling, because I have one such student at home, and I know that the proclivity for keeping paperwork up to date is not great. However, it is important for students to learn that they must honour the requirement to fill in forms and deal with bits of paper. Learning to do the right things at the right time, and to respond to opportunities as they arise, is also part of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to apply within one month is designed to ensure that the loan remains valid. The deadline can be renewed or extended if the Student Loans Company checks with the institutions. That is a bit of a fallback when it comes to the personal bureaucracy chaos associated with students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about starting out in further education and going on to higher education. That is a good point; it is well known in Scotland that many students start their higher education in further education institutions. However, I understand that the regulations will apply if everything is part of the one degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the availability of support, allowing a degree of maintenance allows students a tolerable standard of living. Of course, that is connected with the availability of higher education. If students are not already in higher education, their transition must take into account the further education element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's final point was about whether students stay at home, and I hope that he will allow me to write to him about it. The definition of how we would respond is interesting—it seems that my memory has caught up with me rather more quickly than I had anticipated. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am now reliably informed that there is a provision in existing schemes to cover students who choose to move out of the parental home for no good reason, and that will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have now replied to the hon. Gentleman's questions. I will check the 
	<i>Official Report</i> to make sure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorrie</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>5.19 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly address the points raised by the hon. Member for Ashford about lifelong learning and about the numbers involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all united in wanting more people to be able to participate in and benefit from a course in higher education institutions. Obviously, any change in the funding system can have an effect. We have received one year's figures, which were marginally down. The number of youngsters was up; but the number of mature students was down by about 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can swap debating points, but I do not think that there is any difference of view in the Committee about the fact that we want the numbers of mature students to hold up. We must decide whether the reduction is a trend, and if so, whether it is a trend that started before the new arrangements. There is the question of demography—whether the number of people applying declined simply because the number of people in that age group had declined. We must also consider the ability of that age group to react more quickly than youngsters to the news of loans, because of their greater independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have one year's figures, and we are waiting for a second year's figures. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service figures have increased for youngsters; we will know the number of mature students only later in the year. Before the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough accuses us of complacency, I must point out that we are all concerned that numbers should increase. The money is available to fund increased student numbers; the political will is there. We all want to see how the system settles down. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West would probably agree that the Scottish verdict of "not proven" is probably the best that we can settle for at this early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hardship loans began only in 1998–99. They have been useful on occasions. They are still at an early stage, but it may please the hon. Member for Ashford to learn that we are seeking the views of the people whom he mentioned, to see whether limited changes, running repairs or running improvements need to be made. It is useful for individuals who have unforeseen changes in their domestic or personal circumstances to be able to get an additional loan. We are at present consulting and listening to people's experiences to see whether we can make any short-term changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have great sympathy with what the Minister says, but regulation 8, headed "Termination of eligibility", flies in the face of the concept of lifelong learning, of students coming in and out of education, which the Government are trying to promote. It is the students whom the Minister has just mentioned who find it most difficult to pursue a course. Although there is the leeway for part-time students to finish a course within two years—we welcome that as a start— regulation 8(1) says that people who do not complete
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
their course there and then will have their eligibility terminated. Students from the poorest communities will come in and out of education, and will accumulate the transfer credits over a long period. Surely we should be encouraging that, not cutting off the route here and now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman described. It would not be possible, however, to run an institution in which people were able to go in and out, in and out, in and out. We have to achieve a balance. As we are widening and increasing access and participation, support for individuals becomes important. The hon. Gentleman's point has to be accepted in that context, but the general student population is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's other point related to regulation 19(7). My first stab at that point is this: generally, universities' administrative arrangements could not give carte blanche for students to be present for one month, to decide to leave and then to decide to return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but we are dealing with regulations. The hon. Gentleman made a different point that should be dealt with in a different way. I shall return to that specific point when I have received greater inspiration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have strayed from hardship loans, the hon. Member for Ashford asked about student loans and local authorities. I shall take the two points together. I mentioned a 97 per cent. rate of satisfactory completions—I did not say that 97 per cent. of students were happy. The two things are entirely different—90 per cent. of applications were completed on time, which does not indicate happiness, but shows that the paperwork arrived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as if the Government are introducing regulations for the first time. The regulations are designed to address the circumstances and to ensure a streamlined system in which the local authority, the student loan and the university require one application that is handled in the way that I have mentioned. I cannot see how that can fail to improve the system. Some individual cases will always go awry, but the regulations are streamlining and will improve the system. That is not a sign of complacency, but an acknowledgement that we are far from happy with some aspects of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked a specific question. The Government are confident that key players will deliver. We have involved them closely in the administration, and the system makes clear each player's roles and responsibilities. We have set out the schedule that enables each of them to make contributions at the right time. It details the deadline dates and turnabout times at each stage, and I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman receives details. The matter should be transparent, and we should be able to see the background against which companies or
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
institutions are administering student loans. The Government are dealing with that aspect of hardship loans and student loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ashford made two final points. He asked about the basis on which we would decide that people aged from 51 to 54 were telling us the truth when trying to obtain a loan, and when they say that they are going back to work. I do not have a straight answer. By that I mean that, although the hon. Gentleman may want to be cynical and mean spirited, the issue will be determined by the individual's word and inclination. If he intends to return to employment, there will be a place for him to indicate that. If he does so, that will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background against which the issue must be judged is our arrangement with the Student Loans Company. The company is responsible for the finance and for considering the risks involved in the financial transactions, and it has accepted the situation. If the hon. Member for Ashford pauses for a second and recognises that the numbers involved are tiny in relation to the total numbers, he will realise that they will not be a great financial worry to the Student Loans Company. I—and, I am sure, the hon. Gentleman—would prefer us to encourage 51 to 54-year-olds to go back to university to take a degree. That would show an optimism and courage that we should welcome. We should not put those people under a light and apply a thumbscrew to force them to say that they will definitely go back to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Green</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reassure the Minister that I was considering the issue entirely in that light. The provision is wholly admirable, and I am sure that the numbers involved will be relatively small. I was simply curious as to what procedure would be followed. Will it involve anything more than simple intent? If the Minister is saying that large numbers of officials will not be traipsing round the country chasing relatively few students, I welcome that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.

The spirit that I outlined applies also to repeat studies. The task will be carried out by the LEAs. We will give them guidance on how to decide and will expect them to take account of reasons such as illness and academic performance. The basis of our approach is not to put any more barriers than are natural in the way of people who want to go back to learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the information that I gave the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough on student loans deals with his first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point related to students changing courses, but he read too much into the relevant regulation. I know that the hon. Gentleman will examine it closely, in the spirit of things. However, eligibility will not be based specifically on educational grounds, but on what is in a person's best interests. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that it would not be sensible in educational terms for us to use financial or other pressures to force someone who was not happy on his course, who had difficulties and who would be better off at another institution to stay where he was. The word
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
"educational" means considering the wider picture and being sensible and sensitive with an individual. If someone is having difficulties, that should be an acceptable reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked with great gusto about field trips. I have a formal note on those, which suggests that we are not consulting about fees for field trips. They are excluded by the main Act. That is the information; I do not know whether it makes sense to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read it, regulation 19(7) simply prescribes that if an individual applies for less than the maximum loan, he or she can come back only once for a second bite of the loan in that academic year—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I will give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes, but the provision makes perfect sense. If it was not there, someone wanting to make a protest, for example, could break down a loan into many parts and apply for each on a daily basis. The regulation allows a student who has applied for less than the maximum loan for an academic year, but then found that his or her finances have not run to plan, to make a second application for the rest of the loan. That seems straightforward to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I have visited 17 universities over the past year, and I met students on each campus. Virtually all of them raised this issue when they talked about careful planning—students can plan very sensibly. I accept that, as the Minister said, making applications for parts of a loan on a daily or weekly basis would be ludicrous. But students wanted to be able to apply on a termly basis and take the loan in three bites. That does not seem terribly difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mudie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not. But as I understand the regulations—and perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I are both wrong—loans will be paid termly, so they will be paid in chunks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 19 is specific. A student can apply for the maximum loan for a year, but if someone applied for half the maximum amount, thinking optimistically, "I do not want a pile of debt; I can do with half the loan," and then part way through the academic year found himself or herself in financial difficulties, he or she would not be precluded from going back and saying, "I've changed my mind—I want the rest."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation relates to students who specify the size of loan that they want. The first instalment of the loan requested will be paid on the first day of term, and I understand that the other instalments will be paid at the start of each of the following terms. We are therefore talking about two different matters— [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]—the hon. Gentleman should know better than to take advice from the hon. Member for West Dorset, even if he is sitting next to him.

I hope that the orders will commend themselves to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
