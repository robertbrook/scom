	<i>Further Amendment proposed</i> [
	<i>6th February</i>], In page 2, line 19, leave out from beginning to 'an' in line 21.—[
	<i>Mr. MacArthur.</i>]</p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. When we met last Thursday we reached Amendments 7 and 9. I opened the debate on these Amendments and based my speech primarily on two principles which concern my hon. Friends and myself,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the principle of freedom of choice in education, and the principle of the rights of a local education authority to shape the pattern of education in its area."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6th February, 1969; c. 135.]</p></blockquote>
Then we believed that the Government's intentions were completely set out in the Clause. We have since learned that this is not so. On Thursday there was no indication from the Minister of further steps which the Government were taking that day. Had the Minister sought to intervene, I would have given way so that he could have explained the latest position. The hon. Gentleman made no attempt to inform the Committee that the Government on Thursday were publishing the new White Paper, "The Rate Support Grant (Scotland) Order, 1969". We had no knowledge of this until after the Committee adjourned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet the White Paper calls on local authorities to restrain their expenditure and impresses upon them that the rate support grant for the next year will be based on an arbitrary figure which may bear little relation to the financial strains placed on local authorities by Government policy. In reviewing the growth of
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
local government expenditure the White Paper states in paragraph 9:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Divergence on this scale cannot be allowed to continue …".</p></blockquote>
This declaration made outside the Committee and without our knowledge has placed us in unnecessary difficulty. The Clause is a divergence which the Government now wish to avoid. On Thursday morning the Clause was objectionable. By Thursday afternoon it had become intolerable because of the strictures contained in the White Paper. If the Government pursue the purpose of the Clause, they will be defying their own White Paper by adding at least £250,000, the figure given in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member come to the point of order, please?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At once, Mr. Jennings. My point is simply that this added burden on the ratepayers of Edinburgh and Glasgow is contrary to the purpose of the White Paper which was published on Thursday afternoon. I therefore suggest that the Committee's time would be saved if the Minister were now to intervene and say that he proposes to accept our Amendments forthwith. If he does not do this, I suggest that he himself is creating a divergence on a scale which cannot be allowed to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an entirely new situation to me, but it is not a point of order for me. As I explained at the previous Sitting, it is a matter entirely for the Minister as to when he intervenes. We shall have to await events and see how the morning develops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Thursday the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) moved the Amendment in his customary boisterous manner and amidst a certain amount of argument which gave us a great deal of soap-box oratory. I shall examine some of the hon. Gentleman's arguments. He began by saying that there were
	<br><blockquote><p>"two principles … at stake: the principle of freedom of choice in education, and the principle of the rights of a local education authority to shape the pattern of education in its area."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6th February, 1969; c. 135.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
They are very nice phrases. I shall deal with the arguments which the hon. Gentleman adduced in a long speech, one which was further lengthened so as to keep it going until One o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand the hon. Gentleman's arguments on the question of freedom of choice. Freedom of choice in education, like all other freedoms, is severely curtailed by the realities of living in a society with other people. Freedom of choice in education is curtailed and inhibited by a number of factors, two of which are selectivity and fee paying. If a parent decides to pay for a certain type of education, no matter what the amount is, the freedom of choice is automatically limited. The hon. Gentleman says that it is only a trifling amount, that it varies between £20 and £50 a year, which may be trifling to the hon. Gentleman, but there are many people in my constituency to whom £50 is a considerable sum. The hon. Gentleman ignores the fact that the poorest section of the community, those less able to afford than others, is that section with the largest families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) spoke about people out-with Glasgow and Edinburgh who travelled in. Is my right hon. Friend aware that, apart from such people paying the fees for the school, they have to pay the outwith fee which is, I understand, between £60 and £70 extra?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. The hon. Gentleman has failed to recognise that the poorest section of the community, which we have spoken about in the House a great deal recently, is that with the largest families and is, therefore, the section most likely to be looking for places for their children to be educated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equally, the right hon. Gentleman will concede that that is also the section of the community most likely to secure the free places which are on offer in these schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This brings me to the second limiting factor, which is selectivity. Fee paying limits freedom of choice. It is no good my living next door to the Royal High School in Edinburgh——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The acoustics are so bad, Mr. Jennings, that I should be obliged if you would ask the right hon. Gentleman to speak a little louder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This reminds me of an occasion in the House when I was speaking. I have a reasonably loud voice—at least I did at that time. Someone asked me to speak up. My obvious retort was, "Shut up". I did not make it. I thought that it was a facetious request. I think that this is a facetious point of order. I have no trouble in hearing the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis). I am sure that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) has no difficulty either. If there is any difficulty, the right hon. Gentleman could speak up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good a person living next door to the Royal High or Trinity Academy in Edinburgh and wishing to send his children to either of these schools if he cannot afford it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is the question of selectivity. The hon. Gentleman quoted one case in Edinburgh where there were 308 applicants for 70 places. I pointed out that 238 had no choice. The hon. Gentleman, whilst not denying that, said that the unsuccessful applicants would feel frustrated and bitter, but those feelings would not last long; no doubt they would go to equally good schools and receive an equally good education. That is completely beside the point. Where is the freedom of choice? There is no freedom of choice for the 238 unsuccessful applicants. The hon. Gentleman's assumption that the bitterness and frustration will last for only a few months is wrong, because a child who has been refused a place at the age of 5 and who does not continue to higher education later will find on leaving school that a certain number of situations are not open to him which would have been open to him had he gone to the fee-paying school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This happens regularly in Edinburgh, as anybody who lives there knows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not nonsense. These are the realities. The hon. Gentleman has a very good brief from the Conservative Central Office in Edinburgh, but I do not think that he understands or knows anything about Edinburgh. In Edinburgh, where fee paying is a big problem and has serious consequences, an unsuccessful child is frustrated and bitter for a long time. When, on leaving school, he enters employment, he finds that the old school tie—that social cachet which he has not got—gets something for the other fellow all the time. There is then, another limitation to the freedom of choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire contends that, because we propose to deal with these two inhibiting factors to the freedom of choice, we oppose freedom of choice. I have never heard such nonsense. I can only believe that the hon. Gentleman advanced that argument because he has not studied his brief and because he got carried away with his own verbiage to such an extent that he was not concerned with valid arguments. How is freedom of choice opposed if obstacles to freedom of choice are removed? I have never heard such rot. If that is a specimen of the thinking a person is capable of after having gone to a fee-paying school, I do not rate education at fee-paying schools very high. There are miners in my constituency who are more logically minded than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that if there were no fee-paying schools and everybody had to go to one school to which he was allocated there would be more freedom of choice than there is with fee-paying schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would take me away from my argument. I shall probably come to it later. Nobody pays fees for the pleasure of paying them. People pay fees because they think that they will get something in return. The hon. Gentleman does not make a donation to his local education committee because he is in love with paying fees or paying something for education. I do not know anyone who says, "I am so interested in education that I will give a cheque for £100 to the local education authority". People pay because they are getting something for it. So much for the fallacy of the argument about freedom of choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument is about democracy. The hon. Gentleman spoke about our attitude as an attempt to crush local democracy. The reality of democracy is that the Government lay down what mandatory and permissive powers a local authority may have. They grant those powers in accordance with overall policies. All Governments do this. It is the democratic approach. All that we are discussing is whether we feel that we should continue to allow those powers to rest with local authorities. We are entitled to discuss that. In making our decision we must take notice of what the local democracy thinks. We have to weigh up its arguments. But the decision is democratically ours and nobody else's. All Governments legislate along these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the arguments that the hon. Gentleman says are so compelling? First, he said that the schools had character and quality. Later he said "character and value". But every school has its character, and I assume that every school has a value. Therefore, there must be something special about this type of school. If schools do not have character and quality they should be closed or brought up to standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It took the hon. Gentleman words enough to fill about six columns of the OFFICIAL REPORT to examine this character and quality, and he did not make a very good job of it. He felt that it was a good thing for people to pay because it involved them in their children's education, which is helpful to the child and the whole process of education. Am I to understand that his constituents are not interested in education because they do not pay fees? Will he go into Perth and East Perthshire and tell the people there that he does not think they are interested in their children's education because they are not paying fees? Will he make a speech in Perthshire advocating the setting up of fee-paying schools there? No. He says, "Let us have it in Edinburgh", and not only that, but "Let us increase the fee". It is all right for Edinburgh, but not good enough for Perthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that he would like to see higher fees but more free places. The logic of that argument is the highest possible fees and everybody going
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
free. He did not tell us where he draws the line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood what my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have it here in the OFFICIAL REPORT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend would not wish to lay down to Perth County Council or any other that it must have fee-paying schools, but would wish to give it the freedom to do so if it wished to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman does not make such speeches in his constituency. It is all right to make them here. But let him make them in Perth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let the hon. Gentleman tell his constituents that if they want to take an interest in education they should pay for it. Incidentally, they are paying for it, in accordance with their ability to pay. That is a fair way of paying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to tell us that there was a good social mix in the schools. Nobody has denied that there is a certain social mix.—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh?"]—There is a social mix in most schools, unless the school happens to be in a mining village and there are only miners' children there. Most schools have a social mix, which can be varied according to the territory from which the pupils are drawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even in a mining village there is a social mix. I went to a school in a mining village where there were the children of tradesmen and professional people. One gets them all in a mining village school, and we had a proper social mix there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I was giving the example of a village where there is one main trade, one main employing agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ventured to intervene in the hon. Gentleman's speech shortly after he told us how good the fee-paying schools were. I said that the teachers are much the same in both types of school. They all go through the same system of training and they go to the better schools, whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
fee-paying or non fee-paying. Once again their freedom of choice is limited. If a school has a full complement, no matter how anxious one is to go there one cannot do so. Let us assume that the facilities are equally good and that the class sizes are much the same. What then gives the fee-paying schools a special position? It may be that it is because they have rather higher academic achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is true in some cases, but why? It is precisely because they cream off those likely to be able to reach higher academic levels, allied to the fact that a number of the children come from the middle-class type of home where the background is likely to foster academic achievement. But that achievement is not due to anything in the school. It is due to the material with which it is dealing. If all that material is skimmed off the public sector, what is left to it? In Edinburgh at present one out of four children attends a fee-paying school, including all kinds of such schools. In the secondary schools, one out of three children attends a fee-paying school at one time or another. That is the acepted norm. It inevitably means that the public sector has an aura of inferiority. It is the second-class system of education. When one looks at the expenditure of Edinburgh Corporation one begins to wonder whether this is not so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the first part of the right hon. Gentleman's speech. I came in a little late. But may I ask him a question? He is now saying that the objection to the fee-paying schools is that they cream off ability by the selective process. Is he, therefore, saying that selective tests, which often take place at such schools at the age of 5 or 8, are accurate in creaming off top ability? If he is saying this, the whole basis of the Minister's argument falls to pieces. Is he saying that selection works?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman heard my speech at Second Reading——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —he will know that I made precisely the point that to have a system of selection as 5 was phoney.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does one cream off then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One does it in the course of time, particularly in the secondary system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) confessed that the selection was really a merit? In his remarks he made the assertion that it had a merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that 5 is a suitable age for a process of selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does one cream off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can to some extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is whether it is educationally desirable to put children into separate schools so that one has a sort of academically brilliant school and an academically non-brilliant school. That is what is probably wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Selectivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has seen this in operation. We now tend to think in terms of comprehensive schools because we think that the other system was bad. My point is that this is probably the reply to the academic achievement of the fee-paying schools. It is probably also true that, as the hon. Gentleman says, they have a longer course. But it is not so much because of the school as because of the material. The effect on the public sector is bad because it makes it almost a second-class system of education. That is something we would all deplore. It also makes it almost impossible to introduce a meaningful comprehensive system of education. I understand that in the public sector in Edinburgh girls in the secondary schools outnumber the boys about two or one because one-third of the boys are going to fee-paying schools. A meaningful comprehensive system which will avoid the things a comprehensive system sets out to avoid cannot be introduced if that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the speciality about the fee-paying schools? It is that they give a social cachet to the person who has been to one. He can say, "I have been to Royal High"—or Trinity, Gillespies, George Watson's, and so on. I do not know whether that is the kind of system
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
the hon. Gentleman wishes to perpetuate. It is because of that that we consider the system is socially divisive. One sees the results in Edinburgh, the sort of social categories depending upon what schools one's children are attending.

If the educational facilities are no better in a fee-paying school than in a non fee-paying school, then the person who is paying fees is being cheated; he is not getting anything for it except a social cachet. I have lived in Edinburgh and I have seen the result of fee-paying, which have been socially undesirable and divisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to introduce in Edinburgh a comprehensive system which is meaningful, then we must abolish the fee-paying system. This is the one thing that will reduce social groupings. Nothing else could be done to reduce class segregation which would have the same effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
he was so subdued on that occasion was the large volume of public opinion ranged in front of him and which clearly took a different view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a most effective and forceful speech which covered many points which do not require repetition from me, but, nevertheless, I believe that there are two vital matters which require a good deal of emphasis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Party condemns itself on two main points in the action which it is proposing to take; first of all, as being a party which is dedicated to dictatorial centralised government. If ever there was an example of a devolutionary step which could be taken, this surely is it. Much of the opposition to Westminster Government spring from the arrogant contempt which is shown by the Labour Government for local opinions. This is an infinitely more important matter than the simple question whether or not fee-paying schools are in themselves good or bad, on which there is possibly room for argument. But that the Government should insist that the local authorities should not be allowed to decide how they should run their schooling indicates that all talk of, and all lip service paid to, devolution is sheer meaningless nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point on which I feel the Labour Government condemn themselves is, that they are motivated by a spirit of vindictive spite and prejudice that overwhelms their better judgment. We might have expected this approach fifty years ago, but I have fondly hoped that they had grown out of it. This is typical of their egalitarian approach to problems generally. Where there are what appear to them to be first-class and second-class citizens, their remedy is to abolish the first-class and to change the label on the second-class. This highlights the difference in approach between our two parties. We believe that, if there are two systems, one of which is possibly better than the other—I am not saying that it is in this case—the individual parent should be allowed to choose which system he considers to be the better. I feel, therefore, that the Government are totally wrong, and mis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
taken from their own point of view, in pursuing this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Make no mistake about it, Mr. Jennings, this manoeuvre is the thin end of the wedge. It is designed as a stepping stone towards the total comprehen-sivisation of schooling. We had indications of this in the cheers which greeted the suggestion on Second Reading. Let us not delude ourselves; the Government are intent upon having one class of education only in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude what was meant as a brief intervention by asking the Minister to give us an explanation of why it was that Tom Johnston, as Secretary of State after the war, in his wisdom resisted the attempts to abolish fee-paying schools then, and what circumstances have so changed the issue that the Government have now had completely different second thoughts on the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have liked to have said a word or two about the Royal High School in Edinburgh, but as it is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) I shall be happy to leave it to him. I know he will deal with that matter in a very effective manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The underlying philosophy of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) to which we have been subjected this morning, and which underlay the speech of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur), would appear to be that everything is all right in Scotland if there is a place for everyone and everyone is in his place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire, who introduced the Amendment, did the issue rather less than justice in what was one of the most bombastic speeches the Committee has ever been subjected to. We were told that two underlying principles were involved. The first was the principle of freedom of choice. The hon. Member invoked no less than the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. He suggested that my hon. and right hon. Friends were tearing up international agreements and tramping on the foundations of international law in bringing forward this modest Measure. This was such a patent hyperbole that it was treated with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
ridicule which it deserved, but he did not choose to tell us the clause of the declaration to which he was referring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From an earlier interest in this subject I was a little suspicious about this accusation, so I looked up the Declaration. The first clause of Article 26, which deals with freedom of education, states that higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. There is nothing whatever in the Declaration about fee paying. Indeed, it is quite contrary to the whole trend of the Declaration that fee paying should be a part of——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is exactly in tune with the Declaration of Human Rights if higher education is available to all, and those who cannot afford to pay for it get free places? What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basis of the Declaration of Human Rights is obviously one which hon. Members opposite cannot understand, because they have frequently referred during the debate to the bogus egalitarianism which motivates the Government. These were the words of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire—"bogus egalitarianism". This is what the Declaration of Human Rights is about, equality of opportunity in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as this modest Measure goes some way towards advancing equality of opportunity in education in Scotland, I welcome it. I do not wish to continue further on this subject; the argument is so inflated and so ridiculous that it is not worthy of the Committee's extended attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman, who is learned in the law, also considered the European Convention of Human Rights and a case which is being brought by certain Belgian parents in the Human Rights Court in Strasbourg on a similar point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not considered this point because it has not been raised, but I have not the slightest doubt that the case is not in point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

a case which he has admittedly never heard of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had heard of the case; I did not dismiss it as irrelevant; I questioned whether it was exactly on a par with this, which is something different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that the Belgian case has to do, first, with religion, and secondly, with the tricky problems of the Walloons and Flemings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To deal with the first point raised by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire, the principle of freedom of choice, I would have thought he could not have made this point in Committee after the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh) in the House on Second Reading. It is such a patently bad point in view of the fact that no freedom of choice exists and that there is a hierarchy of schools in Scotland. We have a descending hierarchy from the totally independent to the direct grant, the local authority fee-paying, the secondary, the comprehensive, and so on down the scale. Each step of the ladder is widely regarded as representing a socially different type of school. Entry to the schools is gained by different methods. In no case is the fee-paying school solely based upon the free choice of the parent. The free choice of the parent enters into it if the parents can afford to pay the fees and if the child can pass the necessary examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are selective schools and they run completely counter to the principle of comprehensive education. Therefore they must be rooted out, as fee-paying schools. This is not to say, and I do not say it for one moment, that the schools offer a bad education or a less good education, although I take the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian that in certain cases they may provide academic education where that is not necessarily the most suitable form of education for the child concerned. I went to an independent school, which provided an excellent education, from which I benefited greatly, but this has nothing whatever to do with the question of the principle of freedom of choice. In my own case, I passed no examination at all to enter that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
school; my parents could afford to pay the fees and they thought it a good school. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the existence of schools like that has a seriously damaging effect upon comprehensive schooling in the area. There is no question but that they cream off the best pupils, and, in some cases, better masters and mistresses. We are not so plentifully endowed with either that we can afford to concentrate them on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of the local authority to shape the pattern of education was the second argument of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire. This is patently absurd. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) has pointed out, the fundamental questions about the pattern of education are established by the Government in all questions of standards, teachers' qualifications, standards of buildings and the rest. All are set by the central Government. It is completely inconsistent, I would say hypocritical, to suggest that in this one question of fee paying there should be an independent option open to the local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman not agree that the hypocrisy is on the side of the Government who, from the beginning, pretended that they were consulting local authorities about this matter? There was no consultation: there was compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was a very long period of consultation, in which my hon. Friend took part. He is better able to answer that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Opposition had to do if they were to carry this Amendment, and what they have failed to do, was to show that a genuine freedom of choice exists. They also had to show that this system does not have a deleterious and damaging effect upon the comprehensive principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expected hon. Gentlemen opposite to have doubts, in view of their thoroughly ingrained attitude towards the question of class. They could not possibly be expected to understand the meaning of equality of opportunity. They could not possibly be expected to understand that for all children in Scotland
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
there should be the opportunity for them, within our public education system, to develop all their talents, without any regard to the capacity of their parents to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one problem which we will have to face in Scotland as in other countries, and it is the question of the social mix in the neighbourhood school. I do not believe that retaining a school system which creams off people from different areas, are the highest levels of academic attainment, does anything whatever to the social mix lower down the scale, and I would have liked to have heard some of the views of hon. Members opposite on this problem, which will remain whether or not fee-paying schools remain or go—as I hope they will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question already. I have said that I believe that it is the function of the Government, freely elected by the people of Scotland, to decide the pattern and standards of education for their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the job of any Government, I do not accept, incidentally, that there can be a distinction of principle, which was drawn by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire on this subject, between the law in Scotland and England. He talked about a middle sector existing in England and not existing in Scotland. This bolsters my argument about the hierarchy on both sides of the Border. I wish to do away with the middle sector in England, likewise.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
As a small step towards doing this in Scotland I welcome this Clause as it stands, unreservedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the fee-paying schools on the pupils, as has been pointed out most eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Berwick and East Lothian, is to induce a sense of inferiority among those who do not achieve entrance to the school; among the parents, a rather unattractive type of social competitiveness; and among the staff teaching in the fee-paying schools, in some instances, a sense of superiority, and in some instances, for those who are not, a sense that they are condemned from the start, to teaching at an inferior school. All these are inaccurate and unfortunate impressions, but we must do away with this entirely untraditional type of discrimination between our different types of Scottish schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire was quite right when he spoke of the attractiveness of the rural schools in Scotland, drawing from a large social mix. I agree with him, but it is less than straightforward of him to try to draw a distinction, which does not exist, in his description of the position in the cities. If the hon. Member sees the situation as desirable in his own area, then I cannot see why we should not endeavour to ensure that this is the sort of schooling we enjoy in our most populated cities in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Government on bringing forward this Measure as a first step towards abolishing fee-paying schools entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his speech at our last meeting the Minister was involved for a certain time in a discussion about playing fields. At one stage he give it as his view that the primary responsibility in matters such as playing fields lay with the local authority. He said that it was wrong that the Government should interfere in such a matter. It is a pity that when it comes to whether a local authority should run a fee-paying school the hon. Gentleman departs from what I thought an admirable sentiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand, and I shall not be able to understand, why it is wrong for those who can and those who want to pay some or all of the cost of educating their children, to do so. The right
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis), in the debate with by hon. Friend reported in the Edinburgh newspapers, seemed to make the point that he objected to a situation in Edinburgh where a minority, not a particularly small minority, paid fees, but had the vast bulk of the cost of their childrens' education paid for by the rest of the community.

It would not be surprising if I said that there is nothing wrong with subsidies. I have heard the right hon. Gentleman make many speeches at the Despatch Box defending tooth and nail the right, the desire, of the Government not only to maintain but to increase subsidies to a certain industry. For the majority to subsidise the minority is vastly preferable to having it the other way about. My hon. Friend mentioned the case of those who are unable to travel by train, because the railway line has been closed, yet they still pay taxes because of the railway deficit. There are some folk who cannot get certain television programmes. Does the right hon. Gentleman object to their having to pay the same licence fee, thereby subsidising the licences of those who can get these programmes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: For that helpful information, I am, as always, grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now take up the point about the views of a former Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr. Tom Johnston. This is where I come to grips with the practical situation, which will arise in Edinburgh. The Education (Scotland) Act, 1946, allowed local authorities to go on charging fees, although the 1945 Act had abolished them in England and Wales. The reason was that that particular Secretary of State, who has gone down in the annals of history as one who never allowed any dogmatic or ingrained view to override what he felt was practically right, recognised—and I paraphrase the speech he made on 1st May, 1945—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
that the zoning of pupils in territorial schools would throw an intolerable burden on places outside the locality of the schools concerned. That was the case in 1945, and obviously things have got a great deal better since then, with the increase in the number of school buildings. Considerable difficulties will arise if we go in for rigid territorial schooling in Edinburgh. I will deal only with conditions about which I know and this brings me directly to the case of the Royal High School.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be repetitive and therefore I shall not repeat my Second Reading speech, although the hon. Gentleman made no reference to it in his reply. There is no doubt that if 750 boys at the school, coming from all parts of Edinburgh, creating, as the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East said on Second Reading, this terrible traffic jam at the Mound every morning——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind being quoted. The hon. Gentleman has spent many enjoyable hours going through my speeches for this purpose. But I wish he would get the quotations right. I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am ready to buy the right hon. Gentleman a cup of coffee if he did not say that the congestion at the Mound at 9 o'clock every morning was devastating because of children from various parts of the city crossing there on their way to the Royal High and other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these children are to be returned from the Royal High School to schools in their own districts, the classes of those schools must inevitably be increased in size. Has the Under-Secretary of State done any research to see what the effects of making the Royal High School into a comprehensive territorial school are going to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal High School has been treated extremely unfairly. The Barnton site was earmarked for educational purposes twenty years ago. No instruction was given to the Corporation to build a comprehensive school when it started building two years ago. There was no warning that it was spending £750,000 on a fee-paying school for 750 boys which must become a comprehensive
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
school for 1,700 boys and girls. Could not the school be comprehensive as it is? Could it not be comprehensive with boys only, and with only 750 of them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) on the best size for a comprehensive school. He thought the ideal to be 800, or even 1,200 or 1,300. The difference between 800 and 1,300 is not insubstantial. He added that a big comprehensive school meant that more courses could be held. That gave the impression that, by and large, he thought it better to have a school with more than 800 pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no denying that most education thinking is that 1,700 is about right and that both boys and girls should attend. Edinburgh Members have been sent a note of the meeting between representatives of Edinburgh and Glasgow Education Committees and the Under-Secretary of State on 6th December, and I presume that it is agreed. According to the note, it was said that comprehensive secondary education need not necessarily be co-educational, that schemes using single sex schools were acceptable, but that education authorities agreed that such schools should be co-educational if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus we have a situation on the west side of Edinburgh where we are to have a Roman Catholic comprehensive school—St. Augustine's—with 1,700 pupils; Craigmount, with 1,700 pupils; Broughton, which has been started, with 1,700; Ainslie Park, already built, lying to the north of the Royal High School; and the Royal High School itself, which is to be territorial as well, but is not needed locally. That area of Edinburgh is hopelessly overschooled and will be so for many years. To make the Royal High School comprehensive will make the situation worse still in having 750 more places added to those available locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the note, Councillor Magnus Williamson said that the Royal High School was perhaps in a special position and might be treated exceptionally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Under-Seecretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the debate, the Under-Secretary of State, until a few moments ago, has remained as inscrutable as any Chinaman I have ever seen. In an earlier altercation he was not even aware that I was in the Committee. I do not believe that the Clause can benefit Edinburgh. I do not think that there are any grounds for introducing it into a Bill the rest of which is entirely acceptable. There is no ground for this Clause other than spite and malice, which do not come at all naturally to right hon. and hon. Members opposite. Personally I always find them entirely free of these rather unpleasant qualities. I thought this a thoroughly bad Clause on Second Reading. I think that it is a bad Clause now and deserves to have said of it what was said by the late Sir Winston Churchill of a Bill he had taken a hearty dislike to. He urged the House to "take it upstairs and cut its dirty throat." I hope that we shall do that with this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman made reference to some of my comments about the size of a comprehensive school. It may help towards his edification if I tell him that I have visited a comprehensive school of 2,000 pupils. It appeared to work quite well. I examined the various academic performances and these seemed to work out very well. As to size, I can only say that, from my own administrative experience, the figures I quoted seemed to be about those for viable size. However, because of geographical circumstances, it is not always possible to get over the 1,000 mark for a comprehensive school.

The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) spoke on Thursday for about 45 minutes. He rather stretched his case for the retention of fee-paying schools in Glasgow and Edinburgh when he based it on freedom of choice. He said that in Glasgow there were 250 applications for 70 places in the secondary department of a fee-paying school. In Edinburgh, he added, there were 308 applicants for 70 places. I was grateful to him for those figures because I was trying to put a definition of education when I talked of the aristocracy of ability and the democracy of opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seemed to applaud democracy of opportunity, but he will agree that there is not much democracy of opportunity when choice is limited, for there is not much choice for the unsuccessful. Nor is there freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that the successful were selected by merit. This is central to the debate. I have never, I hope, been hidebound about education. I do not believe that we have yet devised the perfect system. I believe that we learn all the time in relation to new education techniques and how best we can educate children. The hon. Gentleman put forward the proposition that it was freedom of choice that was involved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
but, on the other hand, said that selection was by merit. I hope that he will tell us by what method the successful pupils should be decided upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was not talking of primary schools. He was talking of secondary schools. In relation to these we are discussing children of the age of 12 plus. One must assume that the apparatus of testing of I.Q. must to some extent apply. Hon. Members opposite are wrong to assume that the people of Scotland support them on this. The vast majority of people in Scotland think that it is evil and cruel to predetermine educational attainment at the age of 12 plus. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will say something about his views on the question of merit and whether he accepts that children's merit can be accurately predetermined at the tender age of 12 plus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the opposition to fee-paying schools is a Socialist plot and arises from envy. Much of the opposition arises from groups to which the Tory Party looks for support. I am glad to report that the Tories are being successful as canvassers for future Labour votes by insisting on the efficacy of the fee-paying school principle. Last weekend I encountered an example of this. A young professional man in Edinburgh has experienced the freedom of choice of which the Opposition speak. His children have been rejected from fee-paying schools. His attitude to the Tory Party's policy on education is one of scorn and ridicule. He thinks that the Tory Party is at the bow and arrow stage in its understanding of education. He proposes to move from Edinburgh to an area which has comprehensive education and democracy of opportunity. I hope that he comes to Midlothian, where the system of comprehensive education has increased the wealth of academic merit. A comparison of Edinburgh with Midlothian or of Edinburgh with Fife causes the hon. Gentleman's case to fall flat on its face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Looking at it in reverse, they are buying themselves out of unpleasant and less profitable forms of employment."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
He was referring to fee-paying pupils.
	<br><blockquote><p>I do not agree that this should be done. I do not find children who have attended fee-paying schools at the coal face, or on the footplate, driving buses or on the workshop floor."</p></blockquote>
Then HANSARD records an intervention by "an hon. Member", but I know who that hon. Member was. The hon. Member said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That lets the Labour Party out."</p></blockquote>
A little later I intervened:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not know whether my right hon. Friend heard the remark of the hon. Gentleman opposite who inferred that people who have been to fee-paying schools are not found in the Labour Party. Is the argument being advanced by the Opposition"——</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Extracts from previous debates are all right, provided that they are not too lengthy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the end of it, Mr. Jennings:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is the argument being advanced by the Opposition that if we take out the fee-paying schools the membership of the Tory Party will recrease considerably?"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 303.]</p></blockquote>
What price the political argument now? The Tory Party argues that as long as fee-paying schools are perpetuated the Tory Party will be perpetuated. I know the hon. Gentleman on the benches opposite who advances that argument. If we are talking about political bigotry and Socialism versus anything else, it is hon. Members opposite who are perpetuating it. Because of the Tory Party's policy, without considerations of education, I know that from my experience at the weekend that another elector has been chased away from the Tory party. Hon. Members opposite, because they do not understand education, because in particular they do not understand comprehensive education, are successfully acting as recruiting agents for the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give the Committee an example of the lack of understanding the Tories have of how the people of Scotland feel about education. I pointed out on Second Reading that people in Scotland are attracted to areas which can give them democracy of educational opportunity. I was able to cite my experience on a local authority which had been able to attract highly professional and able staff. One of the advantages my authority had was a proper system of comprehensive education. The first question that future applicants for professional posts in the county
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
of which I am elected Member asked was, "What are the educational opportunities?" If these applicants came from England, they were generally very happy with the idea that their children could go to a comprehensive school without having to face the anomalies and vagaries of the 12-plus or any other mediaeval form of selecting children on ability at such a tender age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is also an attraction to industry. Midlothian is so successful in attracting industry not only because of investment grants and because it is a development area but because it is an area of real democracy in educational opportunity. Young professional men of the type to which I have referred will come to areas like Midlothian, where there is democracy of opportunity and where there is no fee paying nonsense based, as the Tories assert, on merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I illustrated that this is not a question of a Socialist plot. There is adequate professional backing for the argument that fee-paying schools should be abolished. Before the Bill came to Committee I took great care to discover what the attitude of the County Councils' Association is to the Bill. Nobody could describe the Association as being Socialist, by any stretch of the imagination. The Association had no comment to make on the Bill. What price the "revolution of protest"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that Association represent the Counties of Cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but it represents every county in Scotland and is a very powerful body. For many years I was a member of the Association's education executive. On the executive are people of real quality and worth in Scotland, people who know something about education administration. If the hon. Gentleman makes inquiries I am sure that he will be able to confirm this. One of those who represented his area on the education executive was a person of quality and with knowledge of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Younger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully respect the skill and integrity of these people, but does the hon. Gentleman think that they would know better about education in

Glasgow and Edinburgh than the elected representatives of those cities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that they would know better about education administration. They would at least know as much about it, because the Committee has a national composition covering all shades of political and educational opinion. The members of the committee are there because of their proven ability in education administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only a question of the County Councils Association. The teachers, too, have a point of view. The document to which reference has been made came to all Members on 6th November, 1968, and represented the point of view of the Educational Institute of Scotland. No one can argue that it does not put forward a weighty opinion, because I understand that the Institute has over 40,000 members teaching in Scotland. I quoted from this document on Second Reading. The Institute says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here the argument that they prevent equality of educational opportunity can be most firmly grounded. Parents paying fees to obtain admission to a local authority primary school pr[ILL]umably do so to obtain for their children education in small classes, in better equipped premises, by better qualified or specially selected staff. If the claim is made by a local authority, as it sometimes is, that these advantages do not exist, then the parents are being deceived into paying for something they do not get …"</p></blockquote>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to old-fashioned and shallow speeches full of political dogma from two hon. Members opposite. It is always interesting to listen to the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie), because his interest in education as an administrator must be respected; but we like him rather less when he imports political considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the county council point he mentioned, it is true that comprehensive schools have worked very well in many county council areas. One gets a social mix in these areas, but one of the problems of comprehensive schools arises in the bad lands in a city, where one does not get nearly such a good social mix.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make my position clear. I believe that we are utterly wrong to pull down any good schools. We should be seeking to bring the level of the worst up to that of the best. We undoubtedly have in Scotland many bad schools in city areas. We need better and more teachers in them, and more money spent on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I would like to say how glad I am that the Roberts Report is being implemented. We need better buildings and equipment and probably even more power for the teachers in disciplinary matters, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Springburn (Mr. Buchanan) said in an interesting speech on Second Reading when he spoke about the gangs. We want to nip them in the bud and prevent them from forming in the schools. I do not think that integrating a few shy, academic little boys from fee-paying schools in these sort of schools will have more than a minimal effect. All one will do will be to blight the prospects of these boys who might have got somewhere in another school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about integrating a few boys. Is he aware how many boys attend fee-paying schools in Edinburgh?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I listened to the right hon. Gentleman's speech. But he will find that they come from areas where there are already good comprehensive schools. I must be careful, because I do not know Edinburgh well enough, but where the schools are bad I think he will find that comparatively few boys go from
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
those areas to fee-paying schools, and the effect on these schools will be minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that one can stop people buying education—or educational privilege, if one likes to call it that—if they want to. This will be even more so the more affluent people become. Can it really be argued that if a teacher wants a little more money in the evenings by, say, coaching children for O levels he will be stopped? Surely that cannot be possible? It is also fairly obvious that the independent schools will go on, perhaps in France or in Ireland. I know the daughter of a local farmer who goes to a fee-paying school in Ireland. Is this to be stopped? Is she to be refused a passport? It is impossible to prevent people from paying for education if they want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that fee-paying is the central issue here. Its abolition is a retrograde but comparatively minor step. The fees are very small, and there are free places for about 25 per cent. of the pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not anything like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will correct me later. Perhaps he will give me the figures. I wish the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) would please stop interrupting from a sedentary position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many fee-paying schools are there in the hon. Gentleman's constituency of Galloway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a fee-paying school, and the head teacher is the chairman of the Scottish Nationalist Party in the constituency, who is in favour of abolishing fee paying. But the hon. Gentleman is diverting me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the abolition of fees will have a minor effect on the finances of certain local authorities. Glasgow is already immensely in debt, for which the city has to thank successive Socialist administrations, and the rates are terribly high. An extra £80,000 or so will be thrown on to the city if fee paying is abolished. If the Education Committee had been allowed to increase its fees, as it had intended, it would have been about £130,000. When the Secretary of State said in the House that the pupils at fee-paying schools were being educated at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
ratepayers' expense, he had things entirely the wrong way round in resisting money coming into the city from the parents of the fee-paying pupils. When the dust of this controversy has settled we shall find a school like Notre Dame going on exactly the same as before, but no fees will be payable. The result will be that this will cost Glasgow Corporation somewhat more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point has already been made, and I shall not elaborate it. It is that people really know what they contribute to, and therefore one gets a better atmosphere of education when parents are paying fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real gravamen of our opposition is that the Government want to destroy what are, by all accounts, excellent schools. There has been from the other side of the Committee no criticism of the schools educationally. Some of them have been going for hundreds of years. An effort has been made to make out that they are socially divisive. I do not believe that children's psychology is the same as that of Socialist hon. Members. I do not believe, for example, that the boys at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, are eaten up with envy of the boys at Heriot's because their fees are higher, nor that the pupils at a good comprehensive school are eaten up with jealousy because some other children are being educated at the Royal High.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) made this point rather well in our debate on Second Reading. If you will allow me, Mr. Jennings, I will quote a short extract. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also argued that the character of a school derives from the right of selection. Can this argument be sustained in respect of, for example, Shawlands Academy. Is the atmosphere at Queen's Park School more or less desirable than in the Glasgow High School for Boys? What would hon. Gentlemen opposite say about Whitehill School, Bella-houston Academy or Hamilton Academy, all non fee paying? Much depends, on the character and integrity of the headmaster and staff of each school in seeing that the right conditions and atmosphere prevail.—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 349.]</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right. The idea that these schools are necessarily socially divisive is grossly overrated on the other side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
The suggestion of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East that one got something extra from being at a fee-paying school and having an old school tie is very old fashioned. It is about as old fashioned as the letter in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> today from a septuagenarian making exactly the same point. Today, people interviewing candidates for a job look for intelligence, character and academic ability, and perhaps even appearance. I do not think that the fact of one's having been at a fee-paying school makes all that difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want to suppress these schools because they do not fit in with their comprehensive idea. This goes goes against the wishes of experienced educational administrators, particularly in the Cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. These cities are fighting the Government to the last ditch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has twice referred to this point—the gravamen of the charge, as he put it, that the Government wish to destroy these schools. I think that he acknowledged that this is not the position, by admitting earlier that Notre Dame, for example, would go on much the same whether or not fees were charged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to Notre Dame later. If the hon. Gentleman had listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) on his school, and had seen what the Minister said about integrating these schools in the comprehensive system, he would understand that they cannot go on as they are. I shall say more about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point out what Glasgow Corporation is saying about the Minister's decision. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State has not advanced any argument in support of the contention that the abolition of these schools would significantly benefit the Authority's whole comprehensive system."</p></blockquote>
It also said that the head teachers of these schools supported the retention of the schools, and disputed the Secretary of State's view that selection is incompatible with comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opinion of Mr. Tom Johnston about zoning has already been referred to. We tend to think that other authorities with fee-paying schools necessarily
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
are in agreement with what the Government have laid down. But perhaps I may refer to Renfrewshire, for example, which has agreed to abolish fee-paying schools. A minute of a sub-committee states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The meeting considered in some detail the repercussions upon non fee-paying primary schools in the County if those pupils who were presently accommodated in the three fee-paying primary departments had to be provided with accommodation in local primary schools. This was particularly a problem in the Paisley area where, in the Committee's opinion, the present primary departments of Paisley Grammar School and the John Nielson Institution could not even at considerable expense be brought into service as local primary schools."</p></blockquote>
I think that partly answers the point of the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan). The minute continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present the three fee-paying primary departments in the County draw from the areas of no fewer than 46 different primary schools, and if they were all to be returned to the primary schools of the area the existing classes in these schools would be in many cases considerably increased to the disadvantage of pupils already in these schools."</p></blockquote>
We have understood from hon. Members opposite that this will be to the advantage of pupils in the other schools, but that is not the opinion of the sub-committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It then examined in some detail the problem of accommodation in those 46 primary departments, and had to review its building programme all over again. I estimate—it is only my estimate—that this decision will cost Renfrewshire about £200,000 in providing places for children from the Paisley Grammar School and the John Nielson Institution. I do not know Paisley Grammar School, but I believe that John Nielson is a very modern building which, as far as I can see, will not be used in the future for the purpose for which it was built. There is much the same position in Edinburgh and Glasgow. I can give the figures in school building which this decision is likely to cost those two cities, which is about £1¼ million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland referred to the Human Rights Convention, because human rights in the United Nations are something that hon. Members opposite claim to be very interested in. I was surprised it had not been mentioned be-
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
fore. I do not want to enter into an argument as to whether fee paying is or is not a breach of the Convention, but want to refer him to the European Convention on Human Rights, which the United Kingdom has signed. I draw his attention to Article 2, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching is in conformity with their own religious or philosophical convictions."</p></blockquote>
I invite him to look at the position of Notre Dame School in Glasgow, which I understand is the only high school where Roman Catholic girls can at present be educated according to their religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if the Minister wants to contradict that; if he does, I will give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents are being deprived of the opportunity of having their children taught according to the religion of their choice, this will be a breach of the European Human Rights Convention. I ask the Minister what legal advice on this he has received. There is an interesting protocol in the treaty which gives the right of individual petition; in other words, the parents may sue the Government. There is, for example, now going before the International Court a case of certain British citizens of Asiatic origin who are suing the British Government because of their law about selective non-entry into this county. The opinion of parents about Notre Dame has been expressed through the Archdiocese of Glasgow, who wish the school to continue as it is at present. If it does not do so, there may well be a breach of this Convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say much about selection because there is already selection within comprehensive schools in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
Scotland. In my constituency there is selection in the form of streaming within the comprehensive schools. I do not know of a school in Scotland where there are all-ability classes which have been run for more than a few months. Only very few far-out educationists would argue in favour of all-through comprehensive education. In my opinion, the evidence for saying that bringing the brightest children into the comprehensive system has a good effect is rather meagre. Most people would agree that the brightest pupils do slightly less well, but the less academically gifted do slightly better. It cancels itself out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In destroying these schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow the Government are like a gambler. They are putting their money on comprehensive education, and putting more money into it, without the result being sufficiently known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I refer hon. Members to the article written by Dr. Highet in

Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) because I had a very happy education in an expensive school, I have taught briefly in fee-paying schools and for four years in comprehensive schools before working for two years in a ship school.

On Saturday in South Queensferry I was visited at my "surgery" by a doctor on totally different business, but he explained to me that he would have to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
come sharp at 9.30. When I asked him why, he said that he was taking his son to Edinburgh to go through what the doctor described as the "4 plus examination". Just as we have had the 11 plus, we have now got down to the "4 plus" among people who, for not ignoble reasons, want to do the best for their children. I do not scoff at this, but it is a totally unsatisfactory situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A good deal has been said by the hon. Members for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith), Edinburgh, West, and Galloway about Mr. Tom Johnston. Here again I am in a minority because I would say that if one wanted to produce a Governor of Bengal or a proconsul in Nigeria nobody is better fitted for such a job than the British public school boy. That might not be universally accepted among my hon. Friends. Granted the framework of Empire, if one wants to conduct a great imperialist role, probably the best proconsul is the product of a British public school, but of course, things have changed. I acquit myself of malice, since I am frequently asked to go round public schools, like Eton, Rossall, or schools like Daniel Stewarts. I do not paint the picture of Cecil King's Winchester, I go round these places, I talk to the boys, and I enjoy it very much, but it strikes me that there is now among the pupils a great sense of unease. I will not reveal any names, but when I went to Eton I was welcomed by the son of a former Conservative Cabinet Minister who said, "This place is not strictly 'on', is it, Sir?" To which I replied, "No". The world is rather different now. I do not accept this bogey of people going to Ireland or France; most parents are more patriotic than to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another unorthodox view—at least, I thought it unorthodox until my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) hit the nail bang on the head. He said, in his story of the Edinburgh professional man, that if fee paying schools were to be abolished there would be an almighty sense of relief among parents. Many parents are in a great predicament in feeling that they must do the best they can for their families, and for them the right thing is to pay out fees but, if fees were abolished all round, they would have an
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
almighty sense of relief. My position is that I would welcome the abolition of fees as a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now there is a weak point. Eric James once said to me that if the Government mess around with the present arrangements for Manchester Grammar School they will have to do something about Winchester and Eton. I take this point. In welcoming the Clause I hope that it is a step on the road which I would have hoped this party would have started to take during the time when my right hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) was Secretary of State for Education. I say this with no malice or spite, but merely looking at society in a rational and compassionate manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, a word about the teaching of mathematics in the east of Scotland. I worked happily for four years in Bo'ness Academy. Next term Bo'ness Academy will have one qualified maths teacher, and this situation can be repeated in many schools. The situation on other subjects is much better, but in mathematics, with the competition offered by industry, it is very difficult to get suitably qualified teachers. Thought should be given by the Minister and the Department to whether, without creating any social group, those over 15 who want to specialise in maths and physics should be concentrated. Obligations to the gifted mathematician cannot be honoured unless something of this sort is done. I do not want to be tied down to a particular instance, but the Royal High School might suit such a purpose. There are all sorts of objections to this argument, but, granted that a mathematician matures early, granted the shortage of teachers who can cope with the gifted pupil in this subject, and granted the national need for mathematicians, there is at least some argument for saying that the Minister should consider in depth whether one or two schools in east Scotland could not cater for the gifted mathematician.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) who will clearly be known from now on as pro-consul of the Scottish Labour Party. Not everyone in his party shares his views on this point, but he has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
stated his case and earned his name. I enjoyed his speech. It was extremely revealing, as many speeches today have been from the other side of the Committee: the general reason for the Government's argument for this development is that they want to bring education in Scotland into line with current development. I hope that that is a fair quote. All these arguments about selectivity, freedom of choice, comprehensive education, are general arguments. This is the emptiest line I have ever heard because the Government are the current development in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know, as the hon. Member for West Lothian made clear, that the abolition of fee-paying schools is not action in line with what hon. Gentlemen opposite feel. It may be a part of the action, but their real quarry, as the hon. Gentleman made plain, is the abolition of the independent schools, the big fish. Instead they have caught the minnow. It is a fairly frequent result of this Government's policy, and it is a meagre argument for hon. Gentlemen to use in supporting the Government, that they regard it as a step on the way. They have missed the big fish and instead taken a tiny bite from that particular cherry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always pay tribute to the sincerity of the Government, when deserved. I am sure that they believe, genuinely, that by treating everyone alike they can avoid creating bitter social antagonism. It is not their sincerity I question, but the deplorably superficial nature of that philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know children, equally poor, at the same school, more or less equally endowed with brain and character, but deeply bitter and socially antagonistic towards one another. I know of it even in families. Envy and antagonism of that sort have very little to do with environment, and a great deal to do with human nature. Because there may be a shred of truth in this we proceed to disrupt some of our finest achievements, built up over the years, because we think that this will prove to our people that they are all to be treated alike and therefore they need not be jealous. We may find that we have made a big mistake to think that we can break down, artificially, our children's barriers and prejudices, which remain uncured and un-
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
changed in adults. This is a sad delusion, when one considers that we run Parliament on the basis of division and party antagonism. To suggest that Parliament can approach the child in a different fashion creates a large credibility gap in the mind of the child for a start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances it is best to rely on parental choice and to increase it by all means. We have considered the alternatives fairly exhaustively, and all Members have tended to regret the fact that more is not available. The position of the parent is a very important one, because what can justifiably create the most ill-feeling among schoolchildren is not so much the difference between the schools they attend, as the difference between the parents who care for their children and are ready to sacrifice to provide them with a better education, and those parents who think that they can get by without doing anything at all. This is a very strong temptation. I have small children——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was concerned about getting to the centre of the argument. Would he agree that the centre of the argument is not the question of how much money a person has, or his ability to pay fees, but simply that there is a limited number of places available, and there has to be some sort of intelligence test? It does not matter how much money one may have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the centre part of the argument but it is a very important part. It is what I meant when I said that all hon.

Friends tries to maintain that, by accepting our Amendment, we provide what we want to provide, unlimited freedom of choice, but at least we do not deprive our people of the one choice open to them now, which the Government are trying to discard. The answer is not that the parent who cares sufficiently should make sacrifices, but it is that all parents should care more. Every step which this Government take to weaken such a praiseworthy emotion is liable to be stupid and shortsighted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon), in his delightful speech, talking about the importance of catching the big fish, and biting the big cherries. The hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) was talking about hitting the ball on the head. In the proposals the Government have before us, we see all the sacred cows of Socialism coming home to roost—if I may be allowed to add my contribution to these mixed metaphors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to disagree with the hon. Member for West Lothian, who always presents his case so delightfully, and who is so well informed. I would suggest that the schools about which he was talking, such as Eton, are not in the same context as those about which we are talking today. We are dealing with abolishing fee-paying schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow. There is a world of difference. Although it might be said that schools like Eton might have had some success in giving people a capacity to lead, my feeling is that this was a direct result of the system having been designed to produce people willing to be led.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his excellent and sincere speech the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) asked what case had the Opposition put up. We have a splendid case, and my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) was devasting. We have to remember that the Government are obliged to give us a reason for their change. All their arguments have crumbled upon examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said that this was a question of selection, that we were creaming off the best, we were destroying comprehensive principles. Yet he is one of those Members opposite who have said that, because we cannot make an accurate assessment at the age of 12, we must not have the 11-plus. Here is someone saying that the 11-plus cannot work; it is nonsense, we ruin our children's lives by making a wrong decision. However, the right hon. Gentleman claims that in Edinburgh the 4-plus is successful in creaming off the best of the children. He can have it one way or the other, but he cannot continue to ride two horses in different directions. Either selection does work, and these schools do cream off, or selection does not work and these are comprehensive schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite say that this is political ideology; one of the main planks of Socialism; they cannot have fee-paying schools, which are incomprehensible in a comprehensive system. They say they are incompatible with Socialism—incompatible as the hon. Member for Midlothian said, with democratic opportunity in education. If this is so why have they failed so miserably to convince their fellow Socialists in Glasgow, where there has been a Socialist administration, almost uninterrupted, for 33 years? There has been no attempt there to abolish fee-paying schools. Indeed the Council has provided for the building of a new fee-paying school, which is a replacement. Where does Socialism stand? Is this contrary to Socialism, and if it is, why have hon. Members opposite failed to persuade their colleagues elsewhere?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East said that the schools were dividing on class and ability. When will hon. Gentlemen opposite realise what they are doing? So often we have a situation where things are going pretty well and then, for basic class and ideological reasons, they want to upset everything. They never think of the jungle of terror into which they are entering. This is the main reason why we object. As an individual I would not go to the State for the fees. Far from it. The fees are so small that they are almost irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were to make a straight offer and say that, if we were prepared to withdraw our objection to his proposals about the charging of fees in corporation schools, he would withdraw his objection to selective schools, that would be a bargain that I would accept. The Government are not doing this. They are out to destroy these schools, to destroy selectivity within the corporation schools. Let us forget this nonsense about fees and the principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Member or any other hon. Member opposite thinks that these fees are creating a class war, it is wrong for them to begin here. They should start with the sort of schools the hon. Member for West Lothian has talked about, Eton and similar schools, where there are enormous fees. Surely, if the schools divide on class, the ones to abolish are those with the highest fees? Are they doing this? Not they. Not at all. They are starting at the other end where the fees are so small as to be almost irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us forget the hypocritical statements about fees. They are not the issue. We have selective schools in Glasgow with no fees. Among them is St. Mungo's, which is a splendid school. Its youngsters are chosen on ability. It has no fees. We know, however, that the Government have designs on such schools as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is the machinery to work? A number of these schools, such as Glasgow Boys High School and Allen Glen's, are concentrated in the city centre. How are the Government going to operate a territorial comprehensive arrangement there? It can only be done by bringing in pupils by bus from all over the city,
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
which will destroy the possibility of a territorial comprehensive school. In the city centre, housing is declining. Allen Glen's has only a handful of people nearby. It is the same with most fee-paying schools in the centre. If all the pupils attending these schools were turned out to go to territorial comprehensive schools, the city could not cope in the areas to which they would go. Are we to build new schools everywhere? Are we to leave these present schools in the centre unused? The mechanics have not been explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Midlothian, in his interesting Second Reading speech, mentioned division by class, saying that it was growing and must be stopped. This has been put as a principal argument for the Bill. For various reasons, principally housing, we are becoming more and more class divided in our cities. That is admitted. It is unfortunate but probably inevitable because of financial circumstances and housing policy. But if we abolish corporation fee-paying selective schools and non fee-paying selective schools we shall deny many parts of Glasgow and Edinburgh of equality of educational opportunity. Surely a comprehensive school must be a community school if it is to be anything. But, in a city, a territorial school means a division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the rough, tough areas will be concentrated the maximum teacher shortage. There one will find, unfortunately, the greater part of the behaviour problem. Inevitably, a higher proportion of pupils will leave school at 16. There we shall have all the basic educational problems. Indeed, we see this happening now. Already, many parents do not decide whether to pay fees or not. They are asking themselves, "What kind of house should we buy and what shall we spend on it?". This is the economic choice which people will now have to make in deciding to what kind of school their children go to. If the Government think that, by this Bill, they are destroying that kind of division by cash, then they are wrong. The new proposals will simply mean that parents will make their choice by moving to an area where there is a nice school and where there is not a teacher shortage. This will simply make the class division worse and destroy what equality we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend has carried anyone listening with an unprejudiced mind with him. We can see that what he is saying has already happened in the United States, where the better schools are going right out of city centres altogether and people who insist on sending their children to them are going with them. That is precisely what we shall get here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. Of course, we have deprived areas even under the present system. We shall still have the Easterhouses of this world where problems are concentrated. Such problems are intolerable and shocking, but at least through our present selective system there is opportunity for a breakthrough of the social and class barrier. It is at least something which the average man can break through and the only test is that of ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is so desperate and so true of Glasgow, what about Birmingham? Has the hon. Gentleman consulted the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Sir E. Boyle) before saying this sort of thing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have. I did not get his agreement to what I am saying. That is true, because my right hon. Friend and I sometimes disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggests that, because England does not have this kind of corporation school, we should have a different situation. Of course not. The direct-grant schools in England perform the same kind of functions as the fee-paying schools in Scotland. I attended one of these schools. To suggest that people simply buy education is nonsense in relation to them. It may be true of Eton and other schools but it is not true of these schools. The fee for the Boys High School in Glasgow is £7 14s. a term. Can hon. Members opposite say that there are many people in Glasgow who could not afford £7 14s. a term? If they admit that this is so, they must admit that the suggestion of a cash barrier in education disappears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the argument about selective education. In the Boys High School, we have proved that these schools can produce the best out of above-average pupils. With an intake of about 140 a year, the school produced in one year
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
668 Higher Leaving Certificate passes, 997 O level passes and 92 compensatory O level passes. In 1967, in relation to pupils staying on at school, it had 141 first-year pupils, 131 fourth-year pupils and 104 sixth-year pupils. So most of the pupils stay on and have first-class academic achievements. I do not underestimate what other schools do, but if the Government say that one cannot accurately select at the age of 8 they should explain how such schools can get such remarkable academic results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is giving his case away. This was not the central argument of the Opposition Front Bench for the Amendment. That argument was that there was freedom and choice. The hon. Gentleman is saying that there is no freedom and no choice, that selection is based on merit and heaven help people who are not selected on merit. Where is the freedom of choice in that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that everyone has the opportunity to sit these examinations. No hon. Member in this Committee, publicly or privately, has suggested that the selection is unfair or unreasonable or is done for any other reason than academic ability. It is accepted generally that selection is fairly and correctly applied. Of course, everyone cannot gain admission. On his argument, is the hon. Gentleman advocating that there should be no academic test for university admission either? If we do not have it for secondary schools, why have it for the universities? He cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that the tests do not work and then that they cream off the best. He cannot say that there must be no tests in secondary schools but rigid tests for universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal is shabby and spiteful stone-age socialism irrelevant to the education problem. They are entitled to their fun and to bring forward measures which they believe to be in keeping with the stone tablets of their Socialist principles, but let them think about the consequences. The vital question is what is to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To prove their case they must outline the system which will be established after the Bill as compared with the present situation. They must prove that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
average person will get better and more equality of opportunity. They are replacing academic segregation with straight class segregation and it is a tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be asked what I think about comprehensive schools in my area. We are entirely comprehensive there. No one complains. Can the Government say the same of people in other districts? Everyone is happy. Of course. Because Cathcart is a nice area where standards and attainments in education are high. I am sure that there is no complaint in most areas, but what we are concerned about is ensuring that everyone gets a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of fees for specialist schools, there is an argument both ways but the creaming off there is so minimal that it does not matter. But the argument is irrelevant as far as the fee-paying schools of Glasgow and Edinburgh are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government going to destroy 800 years of tradition in my old
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
school? What are they replacing it with? What is the exercise about? I repeat that, if the Government will withdraw their objections and their attempt to destroy selective schools as now situated, I am sure that many of my hon. Friends will give careful consideration to the issue, which is equality of opportunity in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Unless the Government realign themselves on selective schools, they will destroy what equality of opportunity there is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
