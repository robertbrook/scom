	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT WELFARE OF LIVESTOCK (INTENSIVE UNITS) REGULATIONS 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Welfare of Livestock (Intensive Units) Regulations 1978.</p></blockquote>
As the welfare of farm animals is a matter which has always aroused deep concern in Parliament, and rightly so, it is important that I make it clear from the outset that the purpose of the draft regulations, now before this Committee, is essentially technical in nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is already a signatory of the Council of Europe convention on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, which was opened for signature by member States of the Council in March 1976. The convention, which was drawn up by the Council's committee of experts on the protection of animals, sets out, in general terms, principles for the welfare of animals kept for farming purposes with particular regard to animals in modern intensive stock-farming systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protection of animals kept for other purposes falls outside its scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the United Kingdom, nine other member States of the Council have signed the convention and four have taken the further step of ratification. The convention came into operation on 9th September last, when the pre-condition of ratification by four member States of the Council had been fulfilled. To be able to ratify the convention, member States of the Council have to establish that their national law on farm animal welfare is in conformity with its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will, I am sure, be pleased to learn that legislation in Great Britain, as contained in part I of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968, conforms with the convention in all but one respect. This exception is that our law does not specifically require, as does article 7 of the convention, the daily
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
inspection of livestock and equipment in intensive units. The regulations now before the Committee will, together with similar regulations to be made under the parallel Northern Ireland legislation, make good this deficiency for the United Kingdom as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only those countries which have ratified the convention will be able to become full voting members of a standing committee which, under article 8 of the convention, the Council is required to establish once four members have ratified the convention and brought it into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standing committee will have the important task of producing detailed provisions for the implementation of the principles set out in the convention and will be expected to make recommendations to the contracting parties to the convention. It will also be required to facilitate settlements of dispute between contracting parties over implementation of the convention and to give advice when contracting parties seek it. The standing committee will have no executive power since the contracting parties may choose not to accept its recommendations. Nevertheless, the standing committee's recommendations and advice are bound to carry great weight in a wide international forum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I heard my hon. Friend say that the standing committee could be set up when a minimum of four of the 20 Members had ratified the convention. Is he aware that, according to a Ministry press notice, four countries have so done? If that is the case, can he say why the standing committee has not yet been set up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The standing committee will be set up in February. That is our intention. Under these regulations we shall be able to ratify the convention in January. Therefore, we shall be able to become a member of the standing committee from the outset and to participate fully in its work. I hope that my hon. Friend will be happy that the United Kingdom Government will be represented on the standing committee from the word "go".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will agree that this country should not be excluded from participating actively in these important developments. Approval of these regulations will clear the way for us to ratify the convention and so enable us to play a full and vigorous part in the work of the standing committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The draft regulations before the Committee rely on powers in part I of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 under which it is an offence to cause or knowingly allow farm livestock on agricultural land to suffer unnecessary pain or unnecessary distress. As hon. Members will know, the Act requires that the interests affected by these proposals are consulted. This has been done and, as a result, some changes have been made to the proposals as originally circulated. Our Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Committee has also been consulted. These consultations have confirmed that daily inspections of livestock and equipment in intensive units is already a normal practice in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would now like to direct the attention of the Committee to some of the details of the draft regulations. Modern intensive methods of stock-keeping have come to rely more and more on equipment much of which is operated automatically and on which the animals kept in this way may depend for their lives. Therefore the welfare, and indeed the survival, of livestock in these intensive units depends on the effective running of this equipment. It also depends, to a considerable extent, on high standards of stockmanship being observed. The Council of Europe took note of these developments in article 7 of the convention which stipulates that stock and equipment in intensive livestock units should be inspected at least once daily and that any defects in the equipment should be remedied with a minimum of delay. If there is a defect which cannot be put right at once, all measures necessary to safeguard the welfare of the animals are required to be taken immediately. In this context, hon. Members will note that " intensive unit " in the draft regulations is defined in terms of the extent to which the welfare of livestock kept in this way depends on automatic equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 2 sets out the requirement that stock and equipment in intensive units, as defined, should be inspected at least once daily and that, if the stock show signs of being other than in a state of well-being, or if defects are found in the equipment, all necessary measures to remedy the situation should be immediately taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will, I am sure, agree that the British farmer and his stockman, in the great majority of cases, show a real concern for the welfare of their livestock. Our consultations with interests on these
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
regulations, as I have already said, have confirmed that it is standard practice to inspect stock and equipment in intensive units daily—and sometimes more frequently. Such inspections are an integral part of good husbandry practice and the need for them is reinforced by the natural concern of the farmer for the source of his livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to explain why the Government propose to make regulations which require those keeping livestock in intensive units to act in a way which is already normal practice. Approval of these regulations will help clear the way for us to ratify the convention, to become full and active participants in the standing committee and to play a full and constructive role in making European policy in this important area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Tory side of the Committee we welcome the draft regulations. I also welcome the Minister's remarks in introducing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee is aware, there are already in existence animal welfare codes which provide general guidance on welfare matters affecting intensive livestock production. Since the Minister did not mention these codes, I remind the Committee that they do not have the force of law. They are general requirements regarding equipment and inspection which are fully met by all responsible farmers and those involved with intensive livestock units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed regulations rightly give effect to requirements that intensive livestock producers must—I emphasise the word "must"—inspect their stock and equipment on a daily basis. I am sure that all responsible producers in the United Kingdom already undertake that duty and have no objection to this responsibility being made mandatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry press notice to which the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Corbett) referred, and which deals with these regulations, indicates that the United Kingdom Government would like to ratify the Council of Europe convention on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes, which sets out principles for the welfare of farm livestock, including those kept intensively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our legislation—as the Minister clearly said—in Part I of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
parallel Northern Ireland legislation meets the criteria of the convention, except that it does not require the daily inspection of livestock and equipment in intensive livestock units. The Minister has clearly taken the decision, which the Opposition fully support, that these general requirements should not be given the force of law by introducing these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the animal welfare lobby—whose presence here this morning is obvious and who no doubt will make useful contributions to this short debate—and all those who are concerned with the treatment of farm animals are fully persuaded that farmers and producers are happy and willing to accept any sensible and reasonable regulation or instruction to improve further the welfare of farm animals in this country. I am pleased that we are seeking at an early date to ratify the European convention so that all countries in Europe may work to improve further the treatment and welfare of animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will admit, however, that these regulations are unlikely to have any significant effect. Intensive livestock producers in this country already carry out the type of inspection specified in these draft regulations, and they rightly carry out these inspections on a regular basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, therefore, the Opposition have no objection to the principle of these regulations. We warmly welcome them. It is surely in the interests of all intensive livestock producers to ensure that their stock and equipment are well looked after and that they are checked at least once a day. Thus, the regulations give effect to the good practice that already exists in this country, both from the welfare and from the commercial standpoints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister could give us some clarification on certain technical points. In regulation 1(3) the term "automatic equipment" is used. It is used throughout the regulations. But no definition of what" automatic equipment" includes is provided. It could well be interpreted by the industry as meaning solely the electronic controls which are used to switch on equipment which can otherwise be operated manually—for example, temperature sensors or time switches. It is not clear from the regulations whether that is the intention or whether the term "automatic equipment" covers the whole system. The absence of a definition is particularly confusing because some of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
equipment provided with automatic controls can often be used manually by means of an overriding control system. I hope that the Minister will deal with that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another question which again relates to regulation 1(3) where it says in the definition of "defect" that it includes the
	<br><blockquote><p>"total or partial failure of that equipment due to a cause other than … the equipment itself".</p></blockquote>
One of the biggest difficulties facing intensive livestock producers is the fact that they may be given no warning whatsoever of the interruption of services by the electricity, gas or water undertakings. As I am sure the Minister and all members of the Committee are aware, that can cause considerable problems. Clearly, such circumstances may occur at times other than when the daily inspection of equipment and stock is taking place. It is surely, therefore, unncessary to include causes other than the faults in the equipment itself. Regulation 2(4) provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The automatic equipment.… shall be thoroughly inspected".</p></blockquote>
If it is accepted, for example, that in a ventilation system controlled by automatic switching the fans are part of the automatic equipment, it may well be impossible for the stockkeeper—in the words of the article—thoroughly to inspect the fans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of "inspect" as given in the Concise Oxford Dictionary is "to look closely into". Many intensive livestock systems rely on fan units situated in trunking in the roof. While it is perfectly practical to check whether each fan is being operated by the automatic controls in accordance with the required ventilation rate, it would not be possible to thoroughly to inspect each fan without the risk of causing additional distress to the livestock. For example, a stockman would have to bring a ladder into the unit every day and clamber up into the apex of the roof to inspect the fans. Normally such close inspections take place when the building was empty. The term "thoroughly inspected "is therefore not practical, and, clearly, in the instance of fans, it should be sufficient to ensure that they are operating properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that these are technical matters, but I seek answers and assurances from the Minister on them because they obviously concern the industry, the National Farmers Union, farmers and those producers involved in intensive farming. I conclude by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
warmly welcoming these regulations on behalf of the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.46 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Ellis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take up some of the matters raised by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) with regard to the meaning of "daily inspection". He concentrated on the question of fans, and so on. My own feeling is that the wide range of electronic equipment in control systems is very sophisticated indeed. For example, a duck breeding unit, which I inspected included, as part of the unit, an extensive egg hatchery. In the event of a power failure, the progeny being tested and on which much work hard been carried out, would have been lost. So there were back-up systems. The unit had its own generator. If the electricity supply was cut for any reason, the generator automatically went into action. The capability exists for back-up systems, back-up fans, and so on. That is what we should be considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the general welcome on behalf of the Opposition, I thought the remarks of the hon. Member for Macclesfield were too eulogistic in that he seemed to suggest that all is well in this area. I do not adhere to that view. Some members of the Committee took part in the debate on the Brambell committee recommendations. These simply offer guidance and do not have the force of law. They are deficient and it is a scandal that such "standards" exist. I remember that debate very well. Any such measures coming from the Common Market would be much worse. When I took two stuffed chickens in a cage into the Chamber I was accused of being a publicity hound. But that was not so. I did so because of the very detailed consideration we gave, particularly to standards. There was talk of grammes of bird per cubic centimetre. It was difficult to follow and understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am critical of this statutory instrument. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Corbett) will go into the more detailed matters of future regulations. But these are not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of welcoming these regulations and all will be well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend must go back to the definitions. If we can tell the Common Market nothing else, we can say that its approach must be better than ours has been. I fear that that will not be the case when it comes to scrutinising the detail.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
From a detailed look at the legislation concerning the keeping of poultry it can be seen that the standards which Brambell set were lower than those commercially in practice at that time. The applicable standards at that time were how many birds one could cram in without them doing themselves damage or falling down dead, or how many were making a profit. I am not using the word "profit" as a dirty word. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that if we do not feed the birds in the intensive units with anti-biotics, disease would be rampant. That is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a serious point to my hon. Friend. I know that he is a humane man. It is not merely a question of bringing in some standards that we should like to see. We welcome any step forward. Basically what we need, apart from this statutory instrument, is a fundamental reassessment especially with regard to ducks and pig-keeping. Pigs are kept in such cramped conditions now that there is a fear that the whole of a huge herd might be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went round a unit recently. The manager could not see me because he was visiting another unit. He was frightened that if there were some esoteric, rare virus, he might transmit it to another part of one of his intensive units. In intensive conditions, viruses build up. The longer it continues, the worse the problem becomes. One can see this happening particularly with pigs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome these regulations but not in the terms of the hon. Member for Macclesfield. I am critical that we have not done enough in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was I correct in hearing the hon. Member say that it was his experience that many commercial undertakings involved with intensive farming units had standards which were in advance of the legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was contemplating bringing the hon. Member closer to the regulations which we are discussing. These concern the maintenance of equipment and have nothing to do with diet and so on. We are a friendly Committee and hon. Members have a great community of purpose. Therefore I was loath to stop him. I do not think that the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) should pose questions which might tempt the hon. Member to stray further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ellis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been aware of your concern, Mr. Wells. May I thank you for the liberality you have shown? It is not my intention to stray even further from the path of virtue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have attempted to stay in order by saying that we are in favour of the draft regulations but I hope that I have been critical of its shortcomings and in that way have observed the rules of procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept this legislation. It is part of a wider scene of which we should not be proud in its present state. I hope the Minister will renew his endeavours to bring forward a succession of such regulations, examining the concepts behind present standards which are not quite good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that these regulations are well-meaning, beneficent and imbued with the milk of human kindness. I do not wish to say one word which may delay their passage. But I should like to ask some factual questions
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister any idea to how many intensive units these regulations would apply? Would it be tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands? Secondly, what are the means of enforcement? Inspection by the farmer or stockman is clear enough, but is there to be any other means of inspection or enforcement? Does he intend to increase the staff of his Ministry or is he satisfied that there is sufficient staff to cope with it? If that is not the case, does he think that some neighbour, seeing something that he thought was amiss, would report it and, if so, to whom? Perhaps it is thought that the RSPCA or some similar organisation might interest itself. Has anyone a lawful right of entry to a farm or a stock unit? Beneficent and desirable as these regulations may be, does the Minister think that any single animal will in practice, be better off as a result of their becoming law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.57 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. F. A. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are draft regulations. Therefore I hope that the Minister will consider what is said here before they are published.

There is considerable concern in the country about intensive farming and anything that can be done to improve the conditions of the animals reared in intensive units will be greatly appreciated by the general public, by animal welfare organisa-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
tions as well as being in the interests of those who are involved in putting them into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever we may think about such methods of farming there is no doubt that they are with us to stay in some form or other. We have to ensure that the animals raised in intensive units are humanely treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Explanatory Note states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These regulations make provision for the welfare of agricultural livestock kept in intensive units as defined in the regulations."</p></blockquote>
But I can find no true definition, or what is involved over the range of animals. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position. The Explanatory Note also states that the regulations:
	<br><blockquote><p>"require the livestock and the automatic equipment of the intensive units each to be thoroughly inspected not less than once daily by the owner or other specified persons."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean once every 24 hours? I consider that that is utterly inadequate. A man may inspect his stock once a day but the animals concerned may be in considerable stress and difficulty for the remaining 23 hours of the day. These units are almost invariably controlled by automatic equipment. I should like the regulations to say that whenever and wherever it is practicable in almost every case, I suggest the equipment should have a system giving an automatic indication of failure in the stockman's premises or in the office that controls the units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister shakes his head. But there should be a warning. Certainly, in industry, safety regulations are extremely strong. Surely, it is not asking too much to say that there should be an indication of failure at a central board or somewhere that is under comparatively close control throughout the day. After all, these are big units. We should be honest and admit that there have been cases where a great number of these creatures have died in unpleasant circumstances. It is not good enough for the stockman just to visit the unit once every 24 hours. If there are other methods of indicating failure—and they exist in almost all equipment that is electronically controlled and in equipment that is controlled by machinery—they should be introduced and they should be situated in a place where the operators can see them clearly, without waiting for the inspection, which may not take place until 23 hours later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, that is not only desirable bu
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
sensible both for the owners of the units and for the animals. I can see no great difficulty. I ask that it should be done wherever practicable, which I believe is in the majority of cases. I believe that that should be written into the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect of the regulations which I find difficult. They are so widely drawn that they provide a marvellous get-out. I refer to "unnecessary suffering". What is unnecessary suffering? Any suffering should be avoided. In my view, unnecessary suffering should be more closely denned, because quite a lot of suffering can be avoided by proper stock control and other measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations will have the force of law. But whenever we introduce new legislation, we should above all, avoid introducing legislation that is so vague that it will have little effect. Many parts of the regulations are so vague they will have little, if any, effect. There are too many "ifs" and "buts". There are too many loopholes. The regulations must be much more closely drawn than they are at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the time I have been in the House I have always found that one has to be very careful about the way in which one debates statutory instruments, which I used to do many years ago on the Floor of the House. We were always called to order if we strayed. However, it also concerns me that the Explanatory Note says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the defect shall be rectified forthwith"</p></blockquote>
"Forthwith" could be 23 hours later, when a great deal of damage, suffering, pain and death could have occurred to the stock, with considerable loss to the owners of the unit. The note goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if this is impracticable, that measures shall be maintained until the defect is rectified".</p></blockquote>
This makes it absolutely imperative that in every system, electronic or otherwise, there should be installed a device to show at what time the defect occurred so that steps to recetify it can be taken immediately. If the defect occurs within an hour of a stock-keeper having gone round, and he does not know of it—and if it is not made mandatory for him to to know that it has taken place within an hour, say, of his inspection—there can be no question of putting it right immediately anyhow. That makes a nonsense of the regulations. Twenty-three hours could go by before he might even know what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I submit that the Minister should take the regulations back. I know that they are probably in line with the requirements of the Council of Europe convention, but we should set standards in this country and try to convey them to Europe and ensure that they are followed, instead of following standards set in Europe which we believe are unnecessarily lax or which do not meet the requirements which we believe should be met in intensive farming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most encouraging features is that if there is one thing above all else on which the House speaks with a united voice—in which conscience is put before politics—it is animal welfare. The Minister must realise, as I hope he does, that on such matters the pressures from the Labour side of the Committee will be as great as those from the Opposition side of the Committee to ensure that every conceivable, practicable step is taken to ensure the welfare of animals in intensive units, as of all other animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree to take the regulations back and amend them in the way that I have suggested. Of course we welcome the regulations, as the Minister knows. We welcome any such move, but these regulations are vague and need to be strengthened. I hope that the Minister will admit that they need to be strengthened and take them back, and that in the final draft, before they become law, he will ensure that they are strengthened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the judgments which we have to apply to legislation of this kind concerns the matter of enforcement and the likelihood that the regulations will be enforced in the way intended. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Burden) and my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) touched on this matter. It is of great concern to those caring societies which are linked to the body of which I have the honour to be chairman, namely, the Farm Animal Welfare Co-ordinating Executive. We are constantly having battles, not because regulations do not exist, but because there is an apparent unwillingness to see that they are properly enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not stray too far down that path, Mr. Wells, except to say that the matter arises over the whole question of the welfare of livestock, which we are broadly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
considering this morning. Regarding the transport of live animals, for example, I see that the hon. Member for Maidstone (Mr. Wells) has attracted some support for Early-Day Motion No. 59, calling for European institutions to establish standards throughout Europe for the well-being of animals transported live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I feel slightly blushful. I am delighted to have a free commercial for my Early-Day Motion but that is going a long way from the regulations we are discussing today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This underlines the matter of enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second general point—perhaps the Minister will be able to say something about it—is that there is more than a semantic difference between the definitions used in the European convention and in the parent Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968, section 1 of which refers to unnecessary pain or distress. I understand that in practice almost invariably it is a pathological test of pain and distress which is applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 of the text of the European convention seems to go wider in that it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Animals shall be housed and provided with food, water and care in a manner which—having regard to their species and to their degree of development, adaptation and domestication—is appropriate to their physiological and ethological needs in accordance with established experience and scientific knowledge."</p></blockquote>
That seems to draw a distinction between the pathological side and the behavioural side which, on my understanding of the parent 1968 Act is not stated, although I hope that the Minister can persuade the Committee that it is implied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the general position, I believe that this statutory instrument is concerned with far more than the limited technical scope which the Minister implied. It is true that it does what he said it does, but there is a little background to which I should like to refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to part I of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 and the provision under section 1 which makes it an offence to cause unnecessary pain or distress. Section 2 enables the Minister to make regulations with respect to the welfare of animals as he sees fit, which are then enacted by this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations have already been made.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The Docking of Pigs (Use of Anaesthetics) Order 1974, the Welfare of Livestock (Cattle and Poultry) Regulations 1974, and the Welfare of Livestock (Docking of Pigs) Regulations 1974 are concerned mainly with mutiliation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 3 of the Act enables the Minister to issue codes of guidance for stockmen. Perhaps my hon. Friend will recall that when the 1968 Act was before Parliament in 1967, the then Minister told the House that he " had it in mind "—that was his phrase—to make four specific regulations. The first was to specify minimum levels of iron in veal milk substitutes; the second was to require sufficient light for inspection in pig and poultry houses; the third to prohibit the bleeding of calves in veal production and the fourth was to prohibit the docking of cattle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations have not been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am raising my eyebrows at the hon. Member. I have given a lot of latitude. I am anxious that there should be latitude within reason. Because not many other hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. The difficulty is with these debates on specific statutory instruments—they are not just one-offs in total isolation, they are part of a parcel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, they are meant to be one-offs in total isolation. As I have said, we are a Committee of good will, but it is the duty of the Chair to maintain the rules of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. Perhaps I might say to my hon. Friend that he has heard what has been said about the missing regulations dealing with the minimum levels of iron and veal milk substitutes and, I think, the equally important one about sufficient light for inspection in pig and poultry houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder sometimes why it takes two-and-a-half years between the proposition of a convention, agreed by 20 nations, and actually getting to the point or ratification. It will be nearly three years before this country ratifies the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have drawn attention to article 3 in particular and made the point about the stress laid there on the physiological and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
ethological needs. I want to simply say to the Minister that we know in practice that these regulations will be underpinned by codes of practice. We are aware of the legal standing of those codes of practice and we are also aware that they are not put in tablets of concrete to remain for all time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the codes are currently under review and I ask the Minister to give this Committee an assurance that those codes will be reviewed and revised in conformity with the provisions of article 3 of the European Convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member not agree that the codes are not mandatory, they are advisory? There are no opportunites, for example, for the RSPCA, or other bodies to enter these places to see whether the codes are being carried out. Would it not be a good thing if the Ministry, through its agricultural officials, carried out investigations to ensure that they are carried out, because if they are not there is surely a 
	<i>prima facie</i> case of cruelty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. This goes back to this point of enforcement. My hon. Friend will be aware of some specific criticisms made to his Department about the lack of regular and proper inspection of a munber of these intensive units, particularly poultry units. It is a view widely shared in the House that there are far too few inspectors and far too few inspections made. I will leave that matter there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend can give that assurance about the revision of these codes and state that it will be done in conformity with article 3 of the European Convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Gillingham that the codes are the best we can get at the moment. That does not dispose of the argument, but it does behove all us—and there is proper concern in this Committee about the welfare of livestock—to ensure that, in agreeing to these statutory instruments we make certain that they are complied with. This is of importance not only to those in the industry but to those outside the industry who have a proper concern for these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that these regulations will not be seen as an attack upon those who engage in intensive livestock methods. They are open to quite proper debate and argument. They raise the most profound questions, which are not yet resolved. As a nation we
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
want cheap food, and I believe that too many of us turn our eyes away from what happens in that process. At least the intent of these regulations is honest, particularly if the codes are revised, in the way I have requested—to try to ensure that where there is doubt and where standards are below what they should be, they will at least be brought up to the best standards in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.20 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and useful debate. I appreciate the views of hon. Members who feel that more needs to be done for animal welfare than is provided for in these regulations. However, I emphasise that this is essentially a technical matter which we are enacting, to enable us to participate in the work of the Council of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to some of the points which have been raised. The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) asked about the definition of automatic equipment. Our definition of automatic equipment is equipment which, if it goes wrong in any way, causes distress either immediately or in a relatively short time to the livestock who are dependent on it—for example, feeding and watering equipment, but more crucially, the ventilation and temperature control in many large livestock units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of what is meant by a thorough inspection. The thoroughness of the inspection will depend upon the circumstances of the intensive unit concerned and the type of automatic equipment contained therein. It could involve testing control devices or examining the equipment itself. The word "thoroughly" has been taken from article 7 of the convention. We must, however, be practical. There are some pieces of equipment which cannot be thoroughly inspected every day. No one is suggesting that it is necessary to get inside such equipment every day to inspect it. It is, however, absolutely reasonable to require—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister. What does he mean by "get inside the equipment"? It is not necessary to get inside modern equipment now being installed in factories and so on. There is no question of that. There is an automatic failure device on most equipment, whereby failure becomes evident without an examination. There is no question of having to go into the intensive unit to see whether it has failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member could perhaps have a word with his hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield who raised that point. I think that he will find that there are situations where clearly that could be done. However, I accept his general proposition that in these large intensive units there should be systems whereby failure becomes evident immediately. In a large unit the system could take the form of a central control unit, such as exists in large factories, so that as soon as something goes wrong it becomes evident in that control room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that it is not practical in all the cases covered in these regulations. Let us take for, example, one of the most common and oldest forms of automatic equipment—the traditional gravity flow pig feeder. In a relatively small holding with a pig unit, perhaps 50 yards away with an automatic feeder, if the feeder did not work for 24 hours it would not represent enormous cruelty. Animals can go 24 hours without food without being subjected to great cruelty. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that in that situation one needs to instal some sophisticated device connected to the farmer's house so that he knows something has gone wrong. I agree that that should be done where there are large units.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I want to do is to confuse the Minister, but when he speaks of a smallholding that carries out intensive farming, that would almost inevitably be visited several times a day, because on a smallholding the owner would be around practically all the time. My point is that in large units where the regulations say they need to be examined once every 24 hours, presumably because of their size, I believe that, whever possible, the regulations should be mandatory. This could be ascertained over the range of automatic units which are installed which can give warning through a central control system, and that should be made mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think anyone would dissent from the bulk of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will make it clear to my hon. Friend and other members of the Committee that the mandatory regulation, to the effect that the equipment and stock
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
should be inspected closely at least once a day, does not prevent the stockman, the farmer or the producer from inspecting that stock and equipment much more frequently. This is common practice within the industry, and is good husbandry practice as well. We are laying down that there should be inspection at least once a day but will the Minister perhaps emphasise that this goes on, but that inspection, scrutiny and supervision of the stock is often very much more frequent than that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is fair. I will touch on this point when I come to the hon. Gentleman's observations in relation to unnecessary pain and distress, because that is the issue, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Corbett) reminded us. That is what the prosecution revolves around. I again emphasise that we are talking about a technical change in order that we comply with the convention so that we can participate in the Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis), has taken a deep interest in these matters for many years, and many of the debates in the House of Commons to which he referred in which he participated took place before I was a Member of the House. I know how strongly he feels about subsequent developments following the Brambell report. My hon. Friend has frequently made representations to me in that context during the last two or three years. I wish to pick up his point in relation to the codes of welfare and the regulations—a point made also by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead, with whose remarks I shall deal in more detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is a feeling that the codes of welfare should be mandatory. We consider that there is insufficient scientific evidence to justify making all the provisions of the codes enforceable in law so that a farmer would be committing an offence if he failed to comply with any of them. But, of course, as my hon. Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe pointed out, any evidence that a farmer has failed to comply with these codes represents important evidence in any court case where an attempt is made to prove that unnecessary pain or distress has been incurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a short debate on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
a very important matter and I believe that, with great respect to the Minister, he must be prepared to be questioned on these issues. I repeat that if the codes of practice are not carried out or are completely disregarded, it is 
	<i>prima facie</i> evidence of cruelty to the animals in the intensive unit in question. But I also made the point—I hope that the Minister will answer it—that at present there are no powers whatsoever for inspection of these units by the RSPCA or any other animal welfare body. I appreciate the problems there, but I should like to know from the Minister whether, and to what extent, the veterinary officers of the Ministry investigate these places to see whether the codes are complied with. If they are not complied with, what is done about it? Have there been any prosecutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Burden) sorely tempts the Minister. I will not allow the Minister to be tempted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Wells. The statements made and questions asked on these broad areas are indeed very tempting, but I shall return quickly to the debate. The hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. King) asked, quite fairly, whether I could give some indication of the numbers of units and livestock involved. It is very difficult to give a figure for the number of units, but it may be helpful if I say that about 90 per cent, of laying hens and broiler chickens, a high proportion of farrowing sows and young and growing pigs and many calves—though probably not the majority—are housed in units which are sufficiently automated to come within the definition of "intensive unit" as set out in the regulations. A few beef cattle are also housed in this way but very few dairy units and sheep units are likely to come within the scope of the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered the bulk of the remarks made by hon. Members opposite. I come now to the very interesting contribution of my hon. Friend.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is leaving my remarks, could he answer my other queries about inspection, number of staff and soon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to those points in the context of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
(Mr. Corbett), who touched on inspections. I have not forgotten the hon. Gentlemen's point about whether one animal would be better off as a result of the passage of this measure through the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Members will agree that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead has done an enormous amount in the few years during which he has been in the House to increase pressure on the Government and to focus the attention of Government and Parliament on animal welfare matters. He raised some very important issues in relation to the 1968 Act. I take the view that the definition of unnecessary pain and unnecessary distress goes as far as he or I would like. Anything which can be construed as causing any pain or distress—those are well-chosen words—is illegal under our animal welfare legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend pointed out, rightly, that under section 2 of the 1968 Act we have the power to make regulations, and under section 3 of that Act, as I have already indicated, we have the power to make welfare codes. Incidentally, these codes, have been debated by Parliament. I took one on sheep through about a year ago. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) led the debate from the Opposition Front Bench. There is also one dealing with domestic fowls. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) is not altogether happy with its contents. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead that he is right to assume that these codes are not absolute. They are not there for ever. We take into account the representations of the organisations of which he is a member, and of our own farm animal welfare advisory committee, in considering how we might improve these codes when we replace them in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, Mr. Wells, that you do not want me to stray too far out of order. Let me just say to my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead that I cannot definitively answer his questions about the speech made either on Second Reading or in Committee during the passage of the 1968 Act. I was not then, incidentally, a Member of the House. I believe that some of the points he raised are covered in regulations made since 1968, but I suspect that others have not been covered in the regulations made under section 2. I shall pursue this and write to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I know that there is some feeling that not enough inspections are being made. I remind hon. Members that the ADAS officers, who have a very good relationship with the industry take an interest in these matters when they visit farms in the context of other problems to offer advice to the farmer. The State veterinary service has a good record in this area. When it comes to a real care issue, where unnecessary pain or unnecessary distress is suspected, the members of the State veterinary service are best fitted to ascertain the position. Again, I emphasise that the best way to resolve the problem is through advice and by persuading the individual to change his practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been prosecutions. I do not want to go into the details. There have been about 11 prosecutions under the 1968 Act, and many more under the old 1911 Act, in which the Ministry of Agriculture has participated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that from the commercial point of view, if there is unnecessary suffering or bad treatment of animals, they will lose weight and will be of less value to the farmer or the intensive producer? Even if he or she is a cowboy or cowgirl—an expression used by my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham—they are in business to make money not to lose it. Therefore, from the commercial standpoint, there is pressure for people to look after animals. The Minister has referred to the State veterinary service, which does an excellent job. Would he not emphasise that aspect of the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member is simply making the general statement that, by and large, it is in the interests of profitable livestock production that the animals should be healthy and well, I agree with him. I am sure that everyone would agree with him. But if he is going so far as to suggest that because of this general correlation there is somehow no need for animal welfare regulations, or if he says that there is no real distress and suffering in some livestock units, I would not agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the hon. Member's nodded assurance that he does not take that extreme view, which is sometimes put forward by individuals who believe that all our regulations are unnecessary. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
is not doubt in my mind that there is great concern in the country on this question. My hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friends the Members for Hemel Hempstead and Brigg and Scunthorpe, and, indeed, the hon. Member for Gillingham (Mr. Burden) are reflecting, when they pursue these matters, as they do time and time again on the Floor of the House, a genuine concern which is felt throughout the country that more must be done to minimise the risk of cruelty to animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was my hon. Friend intending to give the Committee the assurance about the revision of the code and the making of any new codes being in conformity with article 3 of the European convention? Is he able to do that this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Certainly it would be out inrention to comply with that convention in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I in conclusion make this observation? I refer to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Dorset, South when he asked whether any animal will be better off as a consequence of the draft regulations, and the statement made by the hon. Member for Gillingham that the word "unnecessary" should not be included. He said that the law should prohibit any cruelty where it can be avoided, which in my view is the same as "unnecessary pain or unnecessary distress". There are instances where a bit of pain is necessary. Clearly, where young piglets have to be injected—a routine operation—that causes pain. So we must confine ourselves to the situation where the pain or the distress is unnecessary.

The hon. Gentleman asked whether one animal would be better off as a result of the passage of these regulations. They are technical regulations and if the hon. Member is asking whether, suddenly, there will be an immediate change as a consequence, the answer is "No". He must recognise—and I think the Committee will agree with me—that we are interested in a general improvement in the level of animal welfare.

Advice and education are very important. But we need an improved legislative back-up. I believe that we are right not just to be concerned about animal welfare in the United Kingdom. Cruelty, if it occurs in France or Germany, is just as harmful and just as much a matter for our concern, as it would be if it happened when

animals were in transit from Shetland to the United Kingdom mainland.

That is why we want to enact this technical measure, to enable us to participate in the Council of Europe, so that we can not only help to make progress in the United Kingdom but participate in the general pressure to improve welfare standards throughout Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
