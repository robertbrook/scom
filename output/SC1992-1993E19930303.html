	<div class='bill'>Hedgerows Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 1, line 11, after "offence", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that, in respect of paragraph (b) above, he intended to significantly impair the quality of the hedge."</p></blockquote>
This is probing amendment and is in the same vein as the amendment that was generously accepted last week by my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey East (Mr Ainsworth).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to establish what would constitute an offence. The Bill has been of considerable interest to the farming press and, as a consequence, we have received requests from farmers for clarification of the Bill's provision. They raised the problem of damage caused by livestock. The Bill seems to imply that placing livestock in a field bounded by hedges would be acceptable even though the animals might damage the hedge. We are worried about that. The Bill mentions another person, and clearly animals are not persons. If the farmer were to put, for example, sheep or farmed deer in a field, they could damage the hedge roots and branches. I do not believe that that would significantly impair the quality of the hedge because that is normal farming practice. It would be nonsensical if farmers had to put modern wire fences around a hedge to protect it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I get an assurance from my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East about the meaning of this part of the clause, I should be happy to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, South and Finsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge the hon. Member for Surrey, East to resist the amendment. Apart from the fact that it contains a split infinitive, it would cause the major problem of bringing intention into consideration about whether an offence had been committed. That would be difficult to prove or disprove and potentially would create a substantial loophole into the protection of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Significant impairment has been dealt with by the amendments previously moved by the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). The qualification of intentionality, which he is seeking to add to the Bill, is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are numerous precedents for the word "intent" which have been tested in the courts. For example, section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981—a substantial Act that covers many rural issues—makes it an offence to damage intentionally the nest of a wild bird. The concept of intent is understood by the rural community and it might be worth considering including it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be helpful if I explained the background to the part of the clause that is addressed by the amendment. Amendment No. 116 aims to make it an offence to impair the quality of a hedgerow only if there were intent "to significantly impair"—I agree with the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) said about the split infinitive—the quality of the hedgerow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment attempts to import a specific intention to commit the offence into the lesser offence of impairing a hedgerow. Clause 1(1) aims to prevent hedgerow removal and destruction. The purpose of the lesser offence is to provide a stopgap. It would not be possible to prove that the hedgerow had been destroyed or that the damage done to it had resulted in its destruction—for example, if severe root damage had taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, it would mean that, where work to a hedgerow or work on adjoining land was done unthinkingly, with little or no regard to the well-being of the hedgerow, no offence would have been committed, even if the hedgerow were significantly impaired. Notwithstanding what my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) has said, it would be extremely difficult to prove intent to impair, significantly or otherwise, hedgerow quality. If the amendment were accepted, the onus on the fanner or landowner to take due care would be removed. I suggest that the amendment would unacceptably weaken the Bill's provisions and should not, therefore, be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury referred to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the passage of which I was heavily involved with. That Act and others, which have aimed to serve the purposes of conservation, contain phrases which provide a loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to case law. I mentioned last week legislation on the protection of badgers. Loopholes have until recently been found in such legislation and have been exploited by the irresponsible or the barbarous. I do not mean that the farmers or landowners of Britain are irresponsible or barbarous; they are not usually responsible for the persecution of the badger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would create a loophole whereby the irresponsible individual who is prosecuted away with it. That would gravely weaken the Bill, and I trust that the hon. Members for Cirencester and Tewkesbury and for Hexham will not seek to ruin it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The killer of the amendment is almost certainly the split infinitive and, on that basis alone, it should be withdrawn. The amendment would also shift the burden of proof. A genuine accident could be brought up as a defence, but in such a case it would have to be proved that it had been a geniune accident and not intentional. If the amendment were accepted, intent would have to be proved. That would be difficult and would undermine the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for my grammar. I fear that either my education was deficient or I did not read the clause clearly enough. My intention was not to create a loophole in the law but to voice concerns about the management of grazing. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East has partially reassured the Committee, but we may want to return to the subject later for further clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amentment No. 7, in page 1, line 12, leave out from 'that' to end of line 21 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(a) the hedgerow—

	<ol>

	<li>is on or adjacent to land used for agriculture or forestry, or</li>

	<li>is on common land, protected land or a golf-course or racecourse, and</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) the work of uprooting or destorying the hedgerow, or the work which caused the quality of the hedgerow to be impaired, was not permitted under section 2 or 5 of this Act, and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(c) the hedgerow was protect under this Act.'</p></blockquote>
Under clause 1, if someone is accused of uprooting or otherwise damaging a hedgerow on or adjacent to agricultural or forestry land, obligation is on not the local authority but the owner of the hedgerow to serve the notice. A local authority should have to prove whether a hedge is covered by the Bill. That is in line with all other prosecutions. If a writ or summons is served, the prosecution must prove in court that the offence has been committed. The amendment would shift the burden of proof to the local authority, which would have to prove that the hedge was covered by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would, as my honourable Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury said, shift the burden of establishing the facts, which at present may provide a defence, away from a person charged with the offence and on to the local authority. The local authority would have to prove that a hedge on which damaging work had been carried out was protected by the Bill, that approval had not been given through the notification procedure and that the work was not permitted under clause 5, which covers, for example, the resiting of a gate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires a landowner to establish in his defence that work was permitted or that a hedge was not protected. By dispensing with that as a defence and requiring the local authority to show that the work was not permitted, the burden of proof would be shifted from the defendant to the local authority. I see that my honourable Friend is nodding, so he is in agreement so far. The prosecution—the local authority—would be doubly burdened. In criminal proceedings the burden of proof rests initially with the prosecution. Once the facts have been established, the burden shifts to the defendant. The role of the prosecution—the local authority—is to show that an offence has been committed: that there was a hedgerow, that it was on land within the scope of the BUI and that the person accused of removing it did so. The defendant must establish that, because of facts particular to him, he did not commit the offence. That is the general nature of a defence inlaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
It is wrong in principle for a local authority to have to establish that facts exist that are better known to the accused. The defendant, who carried out the work, is in a better position to establish the facts of his defence than the local authority—for example, evidence of removal and fact that it had not extended for more than 20m. It is surely right that the landowner should be required to consider carefully any work that he undertakes. The incentive to do so would be considerably and unacceptably relaxed by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That approach is recognised in other legislation—for example, the tree preservation order system under which the burden of establishing that a tree that was felled without consent was dead, dying or dangerous and that its removal was therefore permitted rests with the defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not contradict existing and well-established legal practice and the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay the Committee, but the amendment is contrary to the rules of natural justice, under which people are innocent until proven guilty. It is reasonable that the onus should be on the local authority to prove conclusively that an offence has been committed—that the hedge in question was within the scope of the Bill when the notice to remedy was served. As my honourable Friend the Member for Surrey, East has already said, the local authority must judge whether an offence has been committed. Therefore, it is reasonable for the local authority to bear the onus of proof rather than it being borne by innocent owners of hedgerows who may be acting perfectly legally, and on whom the local authority has erroneously served a notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not change the accepted legal principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty. In the first instance, the local authority will have to prove that an offence has been committed. It is then up to the accused to use whatever defence is available to justify his position. That is well-established legal practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of that assurance and our other discussions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>No. 53, in page 1, line 14, after "on", insert "or adjacent to".</p>

	<p>No. 57, in page 1, line 15, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or (c) runs adjacent to a public right of way.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important group of amendments. Last week, we touched on the restrictive nature of the protection afforded by the Bill. Subsection (2) provides that, to qualify for protection, the hedgerow must be,
	<br><blockquote><p>"on or adjacent to land used"—</p></blockquote>
presumably, currently used—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for agriculturee or forestry, or on common land, protected land or a golf-course or racecourse."</p></blockquote>
The amendments would extend protection to some hedgerows not currently included in those definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, we discussed broadening the definition even more widely than the amendments provide. Sadly, the Committee did not approve of that, but I hope that the more specific extensions of protection in these amendments may strike a chord with hon. Members. Indeed, last week, the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) referred to the issue of whether a hedgerow is on or adjacent to common land. That point is specifically addressed by amendment No. 53.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly explain each of the amendments. Amendment No. 52 provides that a hedgerow would qualify for protection, not only if the land adjacent to it, or on which it was situated, were currently used for agriculture or forestry, but if the last use of the land was agriculture or forestry. For example, if the land were now set aside, the hedgerow would still be protected, even though it was not currently used for agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 have been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who may wish to speak in a moment. Those amendments attack the problem in complementary ways. It is suggested through amendment No. 3 that if at any time during the previous 20 years land was used for agriculture or forestry, it should qualify for the protection offered by the Bill. Amendment No. 4 deals with land that has been set aside, and it is suggested that protection should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 provides that hedgerows adjacent to, as well as on, common land, protected land, a golf-course or a racecourse should be covered. That is an important provision because hedgerows of some antiquity often grow at the boundaries of such land. Those hedgerows would not be protected by the Bill's provisions. Amendment No. 53 would provide that protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 54 provides that a hedgerow on an open space, as defined in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, should be protected. That relates to our discussions last week on the need to protect urban and suburban hedgerows on open spaces. We do not want to interfere with a hedgerow which bounds a person's garden, but we believe that the preservation of hedgerows on public open space is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
The same issue is tackled by amendment No. 56, which gives an alternative definition of public open space in an urban area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested through amendment No. 55 that hedgerows on land which is used for nature conservation purposes should be protected. That is because while many nature reserves would be covered by clause 17, which defines protected land, not every nature reserve would be included in that definition. For example, a nature reserve which is owned or managed by a non-governmental organisation would not be covered by the provisions of the Bill, unless it were managed for agriculture and forestry. Therefore, a hedgerow on a nature reserve which is owned and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds—there are many reserves of great importance in Britain—and which is not managed for agriculture or forestry, would not be protected. We believe that that protection should be afforded, not, I hasten to add, that I would dream that the RSPB would want to remove or destroy hedgerows. None the less, if we want to make the Bill complete, it is important to include such a provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 57 deals with a hedgerow which is adjacent to a public right of way. Often, hedgerows grow on one or both sides of a public right of way and would not automatically be covered by the provisions of the Bill. As many people pass along public rights of way and derive great enjoyment from hedgerows, it would be useful to include such a definition in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a quick summary of the aims that lie behind the amendments. Some are alternatives and some are complementary. We should welcome an indication from the hon. Member for Surrey, East whether he might be prepared to consider one or more of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had to nominate particularly important amendments in this group, they would be No. 3, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, and Nos. 53 and 54, which would extend the provision to hedges adjacent to common land or on open spaces in urban and suburban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Andrew F. Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not support amendment No. 52, it was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Islingtron, South and Finsbury because it is defective. It could be called the pop festival charter. A piece of land on which a pop festival was held would not be covered because the last use of that land would not have been agricultural. I suggest that the effect of the amendment would not be what my hon. Friend intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 is an attempt to cover a matter which I raised at our previous sitting. Land on urban fringes may have been used for agriculture in the past but may now be neglected. The quality of hedgerows around such land is important to those who enjoy it and I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East will consider the amendment sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 covers setaside land. Will the Minister confirm whether such land is defined as agricultural land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0975">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for the Environment and Countryside (Mr David Maclean)</div> <!-- member --> indicated assent.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that it is. Is the Minister saying that amendment No. 4 is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, because land would not qualify for set aside unless it was agricultural land and remained so, subject to the normal restrictions and uses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there a risk of problems with the definition if farmers cease to produce food on land? Many of the farmers whom I know who are putting land into set aside are going to grow industrial crops. That is agriculture, but as the crops are not food crops an element of doubt may arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt, The Ministry of Agriculture Food and Fisheries and my Department run schemes on countryside stewardship to encourage other set aside—for example, hedgerow planting and wildlife enhancement schemes. The hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr Hardy) referred to industrial crops. Coppiced willow is the industrial crop of the future, and more important than obtaining biodiesel from oil seed rape. Land on which such crops are grown will remain agricultural land and there should be no problems with definition. Farmers will want it to be classed as agricultural land and the European Community will maintain that classification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Paul Tyler 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be 150 per cent. sure, will the Minister confirm that what he has just said will apply to non-rotational set aside as well as rotational set aside. We all understand that rotational set aside is temporary and that the land remains agricultural, but non-rotational set aside is a more permanent change of use. We want to be absolutely certain about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Maclean</div> <!-- member --> I must enter the caveat that it is not possible to predict what would emerge from the Commission in any plan to reclassify land if, in five, 10 of 20 years time, there were a large movement into industrial crops. I cannott give an absolute guarantee for now and ever more. There are no plans to change the classification of agricultrural land. Every expert would say that even if non-rotational fallow worked as well as we would like it to in our wildest dreams, it would still be agricultural land. I cannot envisage circumstances where there would be a mood among agriculture Ministers or pressure groups in Europe to have land use changed to industrial or any other use if it were
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
still growing a crop, be it hedges, trees, coppice willow, or biothanol—it would still be agricultural land. If a fanciful change were to take place in many years time, one could always amend hedgerow legislation to tie in with a hypothetical classification.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure of the advantage of trying to get assurances of 150 per cent. from the Minister. The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) might have done better to have settle for 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Set-aside land will be covered by the provisions. My anxiety about that I have put to one side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support amendment Nos. 53 to 57 and I hope that the hon. Members for Surrey, East will be sympathetic to amendment No. 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Islington, South and Finsbury and for Denton and Reddish have presented us with an interesting pot pourri of measures. They have shown us their best buys. I agree with some of these amendments, disagree with others, and have questions about still more. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish put his thumb on the flaw in amendment No. 52 about the last use. I agree with his aims. We need to examine the history of land use. I do not think that last use is necessarily the best approach, and I was unable to hear exactly what the last use was that the hon. Member gave as an example. Did he say "pop vessel"? Perhaps the hon. Member was referring to a supply of lemonade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman had difficulty hearing me. I said that the amendment could be a pop-festival charter because a farmer could organise a pop festival on his land, which would mean that the last use would have been for a pop festival, not for agricultural purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There could be all sorts of changes of use, from go-kart racing to the building of an estate. At that stage the provision would no longer apply. We need to find another way of achieving the hon. Gentleman's aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is "20 years" stipulated in amendment No. 3 rather than 50 years or whatever? The amendment seems to be aimed at meeting the aims of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury but I am unsure that "20 years" is an appropriate period. Perhaps the local authority could decide. Why not ask if the local authority to deem what hedges should be protected on land that has ceased to be used for agriculture? That might be the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had multiple exchanges of views on the set-aside scheme and that has been covered. I wonder whether there are other areas of doubt about farm land that goes into abeyance. I understand that the land would still be designated by the local authority to be agricultural land. That should be acceptable but the Bill refers to the land begin "used for". If it is not currently "used for" something, I hope that I will be reassured that we are not leaving a loophole in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 concerns, as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, precisely what we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0976">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
discussed during our previous sitting and I hope that it will be accepted by my hon. Friend. The wording "adjacent to" has been used in clause 1(2)(a) and I do not understand why it should not be added to subsection (2)(b) which would tidy it up and make hedgerows adjacent to the land specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 54 is concerned with open space. I would be interested to hear the response to that and why one amendment refers to "open space"and another to "public open space". That might be because of definitions in law which have been spotted by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, but if not, it would appear to be a variation. The non. Gentleman referred to urban open space and that the Bill's provisions should not touch garden hedges if they are adjacent to public open spaces such as a local park. Local parks are often bounded by the hedges of gardens and the fencing of the open space can be just a couple of strands of wire on the park side of the gardens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recognise that the 20m provision would still apply. The overwhelming majority of private garden hedges would be excluded by that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I move on to amendment No. 55, which is worth pursuing because it concerns those nature conservation areas that are not covered by the Bill. Again, the local authorities could designate those because they do that for planning purposes. If an area were designated by a local authority with reference to clause 17(4)(a), (b) and (c), to which the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred earlier as also applying to an urban area, that might achieve the desired result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced of the need for amendment No. 57. The public right of way covers a multiplicity of rights of way. The amendment would extend the Bill unnecessarily. It would be better to provide protection in other ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have, in a sense, been here before because the group of amendments covers terrain similar to that which the Committee examined at length during our previous sitting. The amendments would extend the scope of the Bill. Although they are all different, they can be broken into three principal categories—those that relate to previous use of land, those that reiterate the existing scope of the Bill and those that would extend the Bill's provisions to include domestic hedgerows. I shall deal with the amendments in that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 52 and 3 relate to previous uses of land. Amendment No. 52 would extend the Bill's provisions to include hedgerows on land "whose last use" was for agricultural forestry. Amendment No. 3 would add to the Bill hedgerows that would be on or adjacent to land which has been used for agriculture or forestry at any time during the previous 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that both amendments are prompted by concern that land which was used for agriculture, or forestry and is then used for a building development will slip through the net of hedgerow protection. I reassure hon. Members that that would not be the case. Clause 16 clearly states
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In granting planning permission … the local planning authority shall ensure … that adequate provision is made by the imposition of conditions for the preservation … of hedgerows",</p></blockquote>
where appropriate. That applies as much to urban areas as to rural ones. There is a practical problem with the amendment. The hon Member for Denton and Reddish made a valid point about pop festivals—or pop vestals, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea originally heard, which sounds even more alarming. Establishing the current use of land is, one would hope, relatively straightforward, but establishing the use of land in previous years would be more difficult. In the context of amendment No. 52, the change to the existing land use may have taken place many decades previously. The introduction of the amendments would result in confusion for countless householders, who would be uncertain whether work on the hedgerows in their gardens would need to be notified. That uncertainty would result in an increase in unnecessary notifications to local authorities for recently planted, relatively low-value hedges. That seems difficult to justify, particularly as planning conditions for built development should cover the potential problem. I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendments are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 4, 55 and 56 are also unnecessary because the areas to which they refer are, by and large, already covered by the provisions of the Bill. Amendment No. 4 would include in the Bill land which is covered by the set-aside scheme. My hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned that matter. I understand that set-aside land counts as agricultural land and will, therefore, be covered by the Bill's provisions. United Kingdom management rules for set aside already require farmers to maintain hedgerows on, or immediately adjacent to, set-aside land. That provides further comfort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 55 would include in the Bill hedgerows on, or adjacent to, land used for the purposes of nature conservation. The hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury raised several reasonable points on that issue. The amendment is unnecessary because the Bill already contains provisions for major designated areas which are associated with nature conservation in its definition of protected land. That includes areas of special scientific interest and nature reserves established by local authorities. There is a technical problem with the amendment because there is no legal definition of what constitutes land used for the purposes of nature conservation, so such a term would create confusion. Additionally it is unlikely, as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said, that organisations which are responsible for land which has been put to the use of nature conservation will spend much time defiling the countryside and removing hedgerows. That is a compelling argument against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 56 would include in the Bill hedgerows on, or adjacent to, areas of public open space in urban areas. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea is concerned about such hedgerows. The amendment is unnecessary because the Bill already includes common land. Common land will include many important urban public spaces. For example, it will include Wimbledon common, to which reference was made last
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0977">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
week. The amendment would also include in the Bill public gardens owned by local authorities, which would mean including ornamental and privet hedges which are found in rural areas. I shall say more about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the amendments that would extend the Bill to include a great many domestic hedges. Last week, I explained to the Committee why I thought that that was inappropriate. Amendment No. 53 would include hedgerows that are adjacent to common land, protected land, a golf-course or racecourse. Amendment No. 54 would include hedgerows on open space. Amendment No. 57 would include hedgerows that run adjacent to public rights of way. I understand the good intentions of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury in tabling the amendments. However, in trying to protect valuable hedges, which may be associated with recreational land, public gardens and rights of way, the amendments would, inevitably, include many private domestic garden hedgerows, I fear that to attempt to include hedges of that type would cause great difficulties. The hon Gentleman's intentions are certainly honourable, but I fear that they are incompatible with the Bill. In principle, extending the scope of the Bill may seem equitable—something we discussed last week—but it would be inappropriate for several reasons. It would go against the general principle of the Bill, which is to protect hedgerows made up of our native woody species in the area in which they are most commonly found; the countryside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider the example of a hedge beside a road. About 1–2 ft from the hedge a line of barbed wire has been put up to prevent stock getting on to a footpath, which runs inside the hedge, taking people away from road traffic. Would that hedge, which is between a road and a public footpath, separated from the agricultural land by a fence or a strand of barbed wire, be covered by the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that that particular example would be covered, but there are several reasons why that must be the case, which I shall explain, if the honourable Gentleman will be patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of urban domestic hedgerows is very different from the hedges that the Bill attempts to protect. There is a world of difference between a mature rural blackthorn hedge and a heavily trimmed privet hedge in someone's back garden. I hope that the Committee will accept that. Similarly, the reasons for protecting urban hedgerows, while certainly worth while, are very different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the honourable Gentleman is taking the Committee down a blind alley. He keeps talking about domestic hedgerows and privet hedges. The provisions of clause 2(4) are such that those hedges will not fall within local authority protections. I hope that the honourable Gentleman will acknowledge that and accept not only the sense but the letter of our proposals, which are not to attack the normal sort of domestic hedge, which will clearly fall out with the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
tabled by Opposition Members would bring privet hedges and such like within the scope of the Bill. The honourable Member for Islington, South and Finsbury referred to clause 2(4). I was about to discuss how the value of urban hedges might be assessed because I suggest that a very different set of criteria would be appropriate in considering urban hedgerows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for protecting urban hedgerows would be very different from those for protecting rural hedgerows. For example, a holly hedge planted by John Innes during the previous 100 years, when he was laying out a garden suburb in the London borough of Merton, could be said to be of historic interest. That is different from the presumption that a hedgerow in a rural area should be ancient and have a high species richness to be of historic interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be asking too much of local authorities, and would be too complex to administer, to expect them to be able to value hedges on completely different scales or by using completely different criteria, depending on whether the hedgerows were in rural or urban areas. That would be the effect of the amendment. In addition, the inclusion of domestic ornamental hedges would create vast confusion among the general public about whether they needed permission to remove privet hedges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that we agree that we do not want any urban privet hedges—I am not sure that I want privet hedges anywhere—to be protected. I am concerned—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am about to cause the establishment of a privet protection league.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is for common land and protected land, which are included in the Bill. My honourable Friend the Member for Surrey, East referred to Wimbledon common. As there are not private hedges on the borders of that common, I do not understand why the adjacent land and hedges should not be protected, as they are on farm land. Farm land also has private gardens that are adjacent to agricultural land. While I accept my hon. Friend's comments on the urban measures in general, amendment No. 53 wants only to use the same wording for subsection (2)(a) and (b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention and am sympathetic to his comments. However, I must maintain that amendment No. 53 would not produce the result that he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combined effect of the amendments would be to impose a disproportionate burden on local authorities as so few of the hedgerows with which the amendments are concerned would be of real value. I know that that is a sensitive issue, which was raised by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish in our previous sitting. I am not saying that there are not hedges of real value to urban communities in urban areas or in areas such as those that concern my hon Friend the Member for Battersea. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish spoke eloquently on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea made an interesting point during an earlier debate. If there is a need to reinforce existing legislation that covers hedgerows such as those dealt with by the amendment, so be it. I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0978">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
have the power to initiate an inquiry into that, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister is listening carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a simple point: The Bill has its origin and being in the issue of rural and countryside hedgerows. The amentments proposed by Opposition Members aim to extend the Bill's provisions to urban landscapes and inevitably fail to deal with the problems that they aim to solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East is consulting his notes. I should like to add some clarity and light to our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right to group the amendments into three categories: those that deal with what land was used for; those that deal with what land might be used for; and those that extend the Bill's scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that agricultural and forestry land has been clearly defined by many prvious Acts: it remains agricultural or forestry land until it receives planning permission to convert it to something else. The point that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish made was, therefore, irrelevant. His pop festival might require a public entertainment licence but would not require planning permission, unless the site was to be used permanetly for a pop festival.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16 provides that the Bill and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 are to have effect as if the BUI were included in the 1990 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already covers developments that require planning permission and it also covers the subject matter of amendments Nos 54 and 56, which deal with future uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to resist the amendments that aim to extend the Bill's scope. Last week, we had a long discussion. The Bill's intent is clear. The hedge that the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish mentioned would be covered because it would be clearly marked as forming a boundary to that field on the Ordnance Survey map and, therefore, would be included within the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to resist the amendments on the grounds that the Bill is already sufficientiy clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that that intervention was intended to give the promoter of the Bill some breathing space.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was receiving enlightenment, Mr. Hill. I and, indeed, the Committee, have since received further enlightenment from my hon. Friend the Member for Circencester and Tewksbury, who made some extremely valid and compelling points. I hope the Opposition Members listened carefully to his remarks and that they are able to accept the points that I have struggled to convey to them. I believe that the amendments are not in the interests of the Bill, which, in principle, Opposition Members support. I ask for the amendments to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

reserves. I listened carefully to the arguments presented by the hon. Gentleman which, by and large, were rational. However, there may be small loopholes in this matter, which should be covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most nature reserves in Britain are already designated as sites of special scientific interest, and, therefore, are protected. Many of those reserves are in national parks, which are covered by the Bill. However, many nature reserves, especially those which are owned and managed by regional naturalists' organisations, are on leased land. Often, although the land is lease, it is farmed and, therefore, covered by the Bill. However, not just small nature organisations but some larger national ones have leased adjacent land for access, car parks or secondary woodland. That land is not farmed. It is not owned by the nature conservation bodies, but by the landowner. A landowner might exercise his right to remove hedgerows on that land, which would not be agricultural land and, apparently, not covered by the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will give us an assurance on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) and should like to take up some of the points that were made by the hon. Member for Surrey, East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished when the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury said that he wants us strenuously to resist extending the scope of the Bill, yet he tabled an amendement last week that would have extended the scope much further than any of the amendments before us. Since last week, he has completely changed his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Surrey, East said that the overall purpose of the BUI is to protect rural hedgerows. That is so, but it should protect important hedgerows wherever they may be. The bulk of them will be in a rural setting and the amendments would provide additional protection for hedgerows which are important but are not covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to domestic hedgerows, and the burden of his argument against amendments Nos. 53, 54, 56 and 57, rested on his observation that they would apply to domestic privet hedges. That is nonsense, first, because the overwhelming majority are less than 20 m in length and secondly, under clause 2(4), a hedgerow must make a contribution to the landscape, have historic interest or be of value as a habitat for plants and animals. Again, the overwhelming majority of domestic hedgerows will be excluded by that. Even if a hedgerow clears those hurdles, the local authority must decide whether to intervene. The subsection provides a trigger process, not an automatic mandatory process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman refers to the burden on local authorities and the great administrative hoo-hah that will be created by including urban or suburban hedgerows, he ignores the fact that a local authority will decide whether to intervene under subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a good point when he said that land managed for nature conservation purposes was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
not defined. I admit to the inadequacies of the amendment in that respect. However, it would be possible to address that if we were to tidy up the definitions at a later stage. The basic point is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe rightly identified some areas, which are clearly managed for nature conservation purposes, such as a nature reserve, but which fall outside the scope of the Bill because they are not included in the definition of protected land. The hon. Member for Surrey, East said that all such areas were, by and large, already covered. That may be true, but we are worried about the areas that are not covered. The sweeping generalisation with which the hon. Gentleman dismissed that point did not do justice to the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He fell into the same trap when talking about public open space. He told us that common land included most of the relevant open spaces in urban areas about which we are concerned. That may be the case, but some urban spaces are important; they have important hedgerows on them or immediately beside them, and they are not covered by the definition of common land. I must say that I am disappointed in the hon. Gentleman's response. Having, last week, readily accepted amendments tabled by his hon. Friend the Member for Hexham, which weakened the protection offered by the Bill, he is now extremely reluctant to accept the amendments tabled by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish will press amendment No. 3 to a Division. I admit that it is an improvement on amendment No. 52, which attempts to address the problem that only land currently used for agriculture or forestry is included. I hope that we may test the feeling of the Committee on amendments Nos. 53, 54 and 55. They are important amendments, the principles and aims of which were not addressed by the arguments of the hon. Member for Surrey, East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee for long in answering the points raised by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury, but, as he repeated his view, I shall simply restate some of the issues that I and other Conservative Members feel strongly about. The hon. Gentleman said that he was concerned with the protection of all hedgerows, wherever they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Important hedgerows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All important hedgerows, wherever they are. That is a worthwhile concern, with which I have considerable sympathy, but it is not the purpose of the Bill. As I have mentioned before, one of the principal origins of the entire debate about Britain's hedgerows was the report produced by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology. That report on hedgerow loss produced some extremely worrying statistics about hedgerows in the countryside. As far as I am aware—I hope that the hon. Gentleman will tell me if he knows otherwise—no report refers to hedgerow loss in urban areas. There is no evidence on which to form even the basis of an opinion about the problem of hedgerow loss in urban areas. That is not within the scope of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said the majority of urban
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
hedgerows will fall within the 20 m exclusion. It is conceivable that many will not. For example, a hedgerow that runs beside a road may have many owners, but it is still one hedgerow. Hedgerows adjacent to common land are likely, in many instances, to be more than 20 m long and would thus fall within the scope of the Bill. If there are houses on the other side of those hedgerows, the hedgerows would not be covered by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned about the phrase "or adjacent to" which appears in subsection 2(a) but not 2(b). My hon.

Many farms and villages are bordered by houses with hedges. I can think of one such hedge which is more than 20 m long. I presume that that hedge would be within the scope of the Bill even though it is as my hon. Friend described a hedge behind which there is a private house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill, for that kind introduction. As the matter was debated at length last week, I suggest that it has been debated to exhaustion. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, who is the promoter of the Bill, summed it up beautifully last week by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, we must recognise the practical problem that is posed by the sheer number of hedgerows in England and Wales. We must always consider the costs and bureaucracy that new legislation will entail." [

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill must be as simple as possible because it must be understood by a wide range of people. The purpose of amendments Nos. 103 and 104 is to quibble with the over-legalistic language of the Bill. It is a question of plain English versus the lawyers. The expression "work including the work" makes my head spin. I urge my honourable Friend the Member for Surrey, East to remove it in order to tidy up the text.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not have escaped the notice of members of the Committee that the point raised by my honourable Friend is a legal one. I hope to be able to shed some light on its mysteries but I cannot hope to be as illuminating as my honourable Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 makes it an offence to remove a hedgerow. Work is permitted under clause 2, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. The first condition, to which amendment No. 103 refers, is explained in clause 2(2)(a). The local authority must have received a notice which states an intention to carry out the work. I shall try to explain this with a straight face. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or work including the work"</p></blockquote>
are included to show that the notice served by the applicant may cover several hedgerows and several operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
The second condition, to which amendment No. 104 refers, is explained in clause 2(2)(b). Having satisfied the first condition, the work will not be carried out, unless the local authority has given notice that the work may be carried out. In that case, the words.
	<br><blockquote><p>"or work including the work"</p></blockquote>
show that the local authority can include, in any notice giving consent, all the works relating to a number of hedgerows and operations that were originally notified to them. When someone wants to justify the removal of a hedgerow he can show that the work in question was included with the other work in one notice. The phrase, therefore, should be read as "the work in question (or work including the work in question)". I hope that I have helpfully revealed all to the Committee. As compelling legal arguments have been made against the amendment, I hope that it will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment to identify a problem. Should the words excluded by the amendment remain in the Bill, it is conceivable that inactivity in a local authority—perhaps due to inefficiency or to an officer being on leave or being ill—will result in permission being granted to remove a hedgerow by default. That would be an unwelcome outcome and is clearly not part of the Bill's aims. I have tabled the amendment to ask why the provision is in the Bill. Does the hon. Member for Surrey, East recognise that, conceivably, there could be a problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to those remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As worded, the Bill assumes that, if the local authority does not notify a farmer or landowner within 28 days of receiving his application that the work may not be carried out, the applicant may carry out the work. That means that the local authority is deemed through its silence to have given its consent to the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Careful consideration has been given to how local authorities should deal with applications to carry out damaging work. The intention is that the system should keep the administrative and financial burden on local authorities to a minimum and allow applications to be processed quickly. That is important as there may be a relatively narrow window of opportunity for seasonal hedgerow work to be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed system is one of deemed consent and that objective is achieved by reducing the number of replies that local authorities will have to send out and by ensuring that, if necessary, notifications are dealt with within 28 days of the local authority receiving them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept and listened with care to the point made by the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury and I have given careful thought to the problem to which he referred. Swiftness and efficiency in the implementation of the Bill are vital to its success. The amendment would mean that local authorities would have to reply to every application they received, even if they decided that the hedgerow was of little value and could be removed. That would greatly increase the administrative burden on local authorities and would probably make it impossible for all applications to be handled within 28 days. The system of deemed consent is crucial to the efficient operation of the scheme. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied and will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am not entirely satisfied, I certainly understand the hon. Gentleman's response. I am concerned that there is a loophole, but I appreciate the arguments in favour of administrative efficiency and rapidity.

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment stems from a glaring gap in the Bill. It is one about which I feel stongly and I know from representations from farmers that they do as well. At the hub is the fact that there is no obligation on the local authority, when considering whether to protect a hedge, to take into consideration the practical requirements of agriculture. Furthermore, it does not have to take into consideration what the farmer has done on other parts of his farm in terms of planting woodland and new hedges. That is inequitable and unfair. The amendment would not create a loophole in the Bill because it would not reduce the ability of a local authority to protect a hedge. It would give the farmer or the tenant an opportunity to have a fair hearing in the sense that he would be able to make a case for why, in the interests of local husbandry and his fanning business, the hedgerow should be removed. Even if it is simply a matter of writing a line on the form submitted to the local authority, it is right that during discussions and consideration by local authorities those important aspects are taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many farmers who have an interest in conservation and the attractiveness of their farms, knowing that they wish to remove a particular hedge which may be of landscape value, plant new hedges in other parts of the farm to balance the landscape. If farmers take such a responsible attitude to conservation, it is right that that should be taken into account when local authorities make their decision. We are not creating a loophole. We simply want the planning authorities, which operate in variable ways, to have regard to essential agricultural interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment. It is Farmers, by and large, who will have to live with the Bill. It is incumbent upon local authorities, when deciding whether to react to the notice that is served, to have regard to agricultural needs. That is an important factor. The Secretary of State will have to take that into account when the matter goes to appeal. It would be less bureaucratic if a procedure were set in place whereby we reduced the number of appeals going to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A precedent has been set for that. Under the general development order for agricultural buildings, the local authority must always have full regard to the operational needs of agriculture and forestry. It must also take into account the need to avoid the imposition of unnecessary or excessively costly requirements, and the usual consideration of reasonableness. The test of reasonableness should be applied under the Bill; it is one that the Secretary of State would undoubtedly apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is valuable and should be considered seriously by the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0982">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
for Surrey, East or the Minister may argue that the local planning authority would not have time to weigh the considerations within the 28 days before a person can be deemed to be exempt from the Bill. Under the GDO provisions for agricultural buildings, however, such considerations must already be taken into account. That process is carried out adequately within the 28 day period. My hon. Friend has said that he does not expect a huge extra administrative burden to be placed on local authorities. The amendment is perfectly reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham, and I shall attempt to answer the issues that he raised. Taken as a whole, the amendments would affect significantly the functions of a local authority under the Bill. Amendment No. 61 is consequential to amendment No. 65. It requires a local authority to have regard to the operational needs of agriculture, when deciding whether to refuse a notification on historic, landscape or wildlife grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A related but more stringent provision than amendments Nos. 61 and 65 is that proposed by amendments Nos. 8 and 9. Amendment No. 8 is consequential to amendment No. 9. It would provide that a local authority could use its powers under clause 2(3) to refuse notifications on historic, landscape and wildlife grounds only if it were satisfied that the efficiency of any business would, as a result of the work not being carried out, be substantially impaired. Amendment No. 10 would require a local authority, when considering whether to turn down a notification, to take into account any proposal to establish hedgerows and the planting of hedgerows carried out in the five years leading up to the notification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 provides for a notification system that must be followed before work that would result in the destruction or impairment of a hedgerow may be carried out. There is no reason why notification should not be simple, straightforward and effective. My intention has always been that that should be so. It calls for the submission of prescribed information to the local authority about the proposed work, which then has 28 days in which to decide whether to give notice to the applicant, stating whether the work may go ahead. The grounds for such a decision woud relate to the hedgerow's quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been possible to put in place more detailed provisions. For example, I could have provided for consultation with statutory organisations, or set aside a period requiring the publication of notifications inviting third-party representations, but that would have been going too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why the amendments to clause 2 would also go too far. I have endeavoured never to lose sight of the fact that the Bill is designed to lessen the burden on local authorities as well as on farmers and landowners. The aim has always been to provide a notification system that can be operated quickly and sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 8, 9, 61 and 65 would compel local authorities when considering applications, having established that a hedgerow should be retained on the usual grounds, to consider the economic case for each
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
notification. That would result in a slower system, notwithstanding what my hon. Friend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unclear how the authorities could have regard to the operational needs of agriculture, as set out in amendment No.65, Authorities are not being asked to make a planning decision, where the balance of operational needs and environmental practice would be part and parcel of the decision-making process. Under the Bill, a local authority's overriding consideration should be whether the hedgerows have an environmental value worthy of retention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A requirement like that suggested in amendment No.9, for a local authority to consider whether efficiency was likely to be substantially impaired would take time. I am not clear how my hon. Friend's envisage local authorities making such judgements and how long local authorities would require to make them. They would need much longer than 28 days to make such a decision, based as it would be on a complex balancing of various factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's should bear in mind that the amendment would also be a burden on farmers and landowners, as farmers would need to provide sufficient information to enable the authority to judge how the efficiency of the farm would be affected. That could mean a farmer having to set out a detailed economic argument each time he wanted to remove a hedgerow. Is that in the interests of the farmers and landlowners?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that in some circumstances the economic cost of retaining a hedgerow would outweigh the environmental benefit of protection. That is why I have provided an economic ground of appeal to the Secretary of State in clause 4. I do not accept that the local authority or the landowner should be burdened with that additional requirement. The Bill gives the farmer access to the Secretary of State within a month of the local planning authority receiving his original notification. Farmers with genuine economic difficulties will appreciate that measure of certainty rather than the uncertainty of having to wait for a local authority to make up its mind. The fanner can ultimately appeal against the local authority's decision in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 would compel local authorities to consider proposals to establish hedgerows and recent planting before turning down a notification. I have thought long and hard about that. I sympathise with the sentiments behind the amendment and I understand the arguments in its favour. Local authorities would be given the power to reward good environmental practice, and it could act as an incentive to plant hedgerows. It is not intended that the Bill should discourage new planting. I could not, however, support that part of the amendment that deals with proposals to plant hedgerows. A notification would be approved on the basis that a hedgerow might be planted at some time in the future, but the local authority would have no power to enforce that promise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a more fundamental reservation. The function of local authorities under the Bill is to protect valuable hedgerows that are under the threat of removal. No amount of recent planting of hedgerows could compensate for the historic value of an ancient hedgerow. However,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
recently planted hedgerows could directly influence a local authority's evaluation of the landscape or wildlife value of a notified hedgerow. I hope that my hon. Friends follow me in that. For example, if a hedgerow is of wildlife importance because it provides a corridor between habitats, the presence of alternative corridors would reduce its relative importance. Similarly, if a hedgerow were part of an extensive network of hedgerows in the landscape, its individual contribution might be relatively small. A farmer who has engaged in hedgerow planting is likely to see his efforts taken into account by the local authority when it assesses the relative value of an individual hedgerow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of the utmost importance that we should consider the provisions of clause 2 in the context of hedgerow removal. We are not debating the development of land, which rightly calls for a more detailed consideration, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham has referred. Authorities must take a view on the environmental value of hedgerows within the strict criteria that will be set out in guidance to be issued by my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State. My hon. Friend the Minister might like to comment on that in a moment. I submit that to add more considerations and balancing acts to a local authority's functions would be counterproductive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some have agrued that hedgerows legislation is unecessary, with which members of the Committee would disagree. There is a real danger of overlegislating when the problem clearly calls for a light touch, which is what I have attempted to achieve. We shall consider an economic ground for appeal under clause 4, but I urge my hon. Friends to seek leave to withdraw their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East, is right to assert that we must not lose sight of the intention of the Bill to protect hedgerows of value. Local authorities are to make judgments based on the environmental importance of hedgerows and not on the number of hedgerows planted by any individual. My hon Friend gave a clear explanation of how those factors are linked and how the evaluation of one individual's notified hedgerow can be affected by the presence of other hedgerows that he or she may have planted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the guidance that the Secretary of State will issue to local authorities is clear about the importance of viewing the notified hedgerow in the context of all other hedgerows that contribute to wildlife, landscape, environment and so on. I know that the Secretary of State shares the concern of hon. Members that the guidance to be issued to local authorities should be clear because it will be a key part of the follow-up to the Bill. In line with the current norm, we will draw up the guidance, take the views of experts, go out to consultation, adapt, amend and finally publish it. I hope that that will reassure my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to think carefully about the dangers of local authorities judging the operational needs of agriculture. So that I do not have 400 local authorities writing letters to me, I pose a question: do my hon. Friends
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
trust the competence of many local authorities to make those value judgments? Do they seriously think that they are capable of deciding on the operational needs of agriculture and the countryside? I do not believe that they have that technical competence and, if they did, they and farmers would need to have so many consultants' reports that the process would be very costly and time-consuming as my honourable Friend the Member for Surrey, East said. It is better to stick to the Bill rather than allow them to decide on the operational needs of agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly reassured in relation to amendment No. 10 and the planting of new hedges by what was said by my honourable Friends the Member for Surrey, East and the Minister. I accept that guidance will form a significant part of the follow-up to the Bill and I am reassured by the Minister's undertaking that comprehensive guidance will be published to steer local authorities in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain unconvinced by the Minister's views on taking farming needs into consideration because he vastly overstated what we are seeking. Basically, we merely want a farmer to have an opportunity to state on the form the reason why someone wants to take out a hedge and a brief list of the points that he wants to make. We did not intend to go as far as my honourable Friend the Member for Surrey, East suggested, and I should like to have further discussions with him about local authorities having some regard for fanning.

I believe, however, that amendment No. 11 is not necessary as provision is already made for notice to be given in writing in subsection (2)(b)(ii), where that requirement is clearly stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept that individuals have the right to know the basis of decisions that affect them. That is in keeping with the citizens charter and it is entirely reasonable. I agree that a local authority should give an explanation for its decision to turn down a notification—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am glad that Opposition Members have livened up at the mention of the citizens charter. Local authorities everywhere are livening up at the mention of the citizens charter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply observing to my hon. Friends that the citizens charter obviously means that farmers will have to wear name badges when destroying hedgerows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(3) requires local authorities to state nothing beyond the ground or grounds on which the decision is taken. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury that that is too limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 108 would require a local authority to state the grounds on which the decision is given, with a brief statement of the matters on which the authority relies. A requirement to give a statement of reasons—as in amendment No. 11—or even an explanation—as in amendment No. 100—would not fully account for the fact that authorities must issue a written decision within 28 days of receiving the notification. A requirement to give a brief statement strikes the right balance and will at least give applicants some tangible idea of the reasoning behind the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also taken the opportunity to improve this part of the Bill by including in amendment No. 108 a requirement on local authorities when turning down a notification to state the applicant's right of appeal under clause 4. I hope that hon. Members will agree that is necessary if the appeals system is to work effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 114 makes similar changes to clause 8 on the rights of appeal arising from the service of a hedgerow enforcement notice. I therefore ask my hon. Friends to withdraw the amendment. I urge hon. Members to accept amendments Nos. 108 and 114.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because amendments Nos. 62, 63 and 64 deal with our old friend "significant". It is now in a slightly different guise: "if significant". We do not need to detain the Committee with a long justification. It is the same sort of "significant" as the one accepted by hon. Friend the Member for Surrey, East. In this case, "if significant" relates to setting landscape and other values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 12 is to flesh out what we mean by "if significant". The amendment would insert the provision that a hedgerow should be visible or considered significant to the value of landscape by virtue of being visible from a road or highway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a tenuous argument. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that if a hedgerow is not visible it does not have any conservation value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the amendment says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, as decisions made by local authorities will inevitably be subjective, we are trying to insert some guidance to help with determining the value of a hedge. Clearly a hedge that is visible from a highway is more significant to the landscape than one that is invisible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that because a hedge is visible from the M5 it is of more landscape value than if it were visible only from the footpaths around the coasts of Cornwall? That is a preposterous suggestion. People in cars are not the only ones who view the countryside. I hope that more people will do so on foot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not understand the meaning of a highway. We mean hedges that are visible by those walking on footpaths, those on roads or indeed on the M5. We maintain that a hedgerow that is visible to people passing by—walking on the Cornish paths—is of more value than one that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
invisible. We are not discounting invisible hedges. We are trying to create a scale to guide local authorities. Other legislation and rules and regulations are concerned with that. The hedgerow incentive scheme applies to visible hedges. This applies to grants given under the hedgerow incentive scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one major reason why hedgerows are important is that wildlife live in them? Is is not completely irrelevant whether they are visible or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee are wilfully trying to misinterpret the purpose of the amendment. The amendment does not mean that if a hedge is not visible it has no value for wildlife. In the landscape—not the wildlife—category, visibility must play a role in the local authority's decisions. The amendment would simply resolve the matter for local councils and local planning authorities making those decisions by placing greater value on one hedge for landscape purposes than on another. I should have thought that that was fairly clear and that public visibility would be an important factor to be taken into account by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hexham realised that, the longer he talked about amendment No. 12, the more difficult it became to justify it. There are several clear reasons why the amendment is a nonsense. The hon. Gentleman appeared to be confused about the definition of a highway and that of a right of way. Not every footpath would be covered by the definition of highway. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman's point was incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Genleman will find that his legal information is wrong. Under the Highways Act 1980, all footpaths on the definitive map are covered by the definition of a highway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point. The definitive map is far from complete: many footpaths are not on it. Why should we assume that a hedgerow is of value to a landscape only if people can see it from a park that is included on a definitive map as defined by an Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is making the same point that I made. It is important to realise that the possibilities of argument and controversy about the definitive map—which point on the map, which path, whether one could see over a hedge—are ridiculous. I shall contribute to the hon. Gentleman's demolition of the amendment by saying that large areas of the countryside are not immediately visible to people walking footpaths and that it is extremely important that the landscape value of those hedges and their function as wildlife habitat is maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Furthermore, there are large parts of the country where people might not use a footpath to ascend a hill or hillock from which the landscape is visible, including the glory of the hedgerow cover. Most hedgerows would not be covered by the Bill if the amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 62. 63 and 64 are a little more clever.
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
They would incorporate the idea of significance. That would be a different significance from the significant impairment that was discussed in our previous sitting. If the amendments were accepted, the contribution of the hedgerow to the landscape would be judged "if significant". Similarly, that would be used to qualify the historic interest and the value of the hedgerow as a habitat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Surrey, East rightly said that what must be taken into account is not only an individual hedgerow but the way in which it would fit in with the overall pattern of hedgerows in an area. The contribution of the hedgerow to the landscape, "if significant", would immediately cause problems about how to define whether the way in which it fits into that pattern is significant. It may not be especially significant if taken in isolation, but it might be extremely significant in relation to the pattern of hedgerows in an area. I am worried about amendments Nos. 62, 63 and 64; much more worried than I was about some of those which we discussed last week. I hope that the hon. Member for Surrey, East will resist them. I certainly hope that we shall kick out with alacrity the wretched amendment No. 12, which has nothing to commend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members have dealt effectively, if somewhat partially, with the proposed amendments and I do not intend to dwell on them. It seems to me that they raise the interesting existential point about whether something exists if it cannot be seen or heard—
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> One could spend many hours debating that, but I do not propose to do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behind the amendments is a valid attempt to reduce the subjectivity that is, perhaps, inherent in any local authority assessment. If that is the intention of amendment No. 12, which strikes me as a curious amendment, it will be dealt with in the guidance notes provided by the Secretary of State when hedgerows are evaluated. I ask my hon. Friends to withdraw that interesting amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everybody else does!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to clarify my remarks. May I first return to the rather snide remark of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury about farmers having to wear name-tags on their heads when they are ripping out hedgerows—I think those were almost his words. That is a nasty slur on farmers, which, I suppose, he made because he represents an urban, not a rural constituency. Why did he not say that farmers should wear name-tags when they plant hedges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is being entirely unfair. If any slur was intended, it was on the citizens charter and certainly not on the farmers who, for the most part, pay close attention to the protection of hedges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the words of the honourable Member for Hexham in moving the amendment. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
are several precedents for the amendment. For example, the hedgerow incentive scheme, places emphasis on hedges that are visible from a highway. In Wales, the hedgerow renovation scheme makes grants of public money and gives priority to those hedges that are near a highway. Other precedents also exist. The Countryside Commission gives grants. In some schemes, money is given only for those hedges that are near a highway, so the amendment is not as frivolous as it seems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Surrey, East mentioned the issue of subjectivity. The contribution that the hedgerow makes to the landscape, as stated under clause 2(4), is a subjective concept. Therefore, as it is open to argument, it is reasonable to insert the words, "if significant". I accept that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the historic interest of the hedgerow, and the value of the hedgerow as a habitat for plants or animals"</p></blockquote>
provides a clearer concept of its contribution and that the words, "if significant" may not be as important. On the basis that the Minister is prepared to provide clear guidelines on those matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee would not want the Bill to weaken existing arrangements for the protection of hedgerows, but it is possible that such weakening will occur if amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position relates to the enclosure of large areas of lowland England before 1840. There are 4,000 Acts of Enclosure, each covering common land in different parishes. The matter came to my notice when I first tried to introduce a Bill to protect hedgerows in the early 1980s. I have an interest in local history, and I had been reading a local enclosure Act when I discovered that that Act required that the fields to be established from enclosing common land must be protected by thorn fences. The landowner who was given possession of that former common land, and his heirs and assigns, were placed under a continuing obligation perpetually to maintain those hedgerows. I was surprised and read one or two other Acts, which contained the same provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, Mr Colin Seymour was studying enclosure legislation in west Yorkshire and found that the same perpetual condition applied. A noble Lord of my acquaintance was kind enough to show me some enclosure Acts covering Lincolnshire, which also contained that perpetual condition, but in addition required the hedges to be perpetually protected by an oaken fence three rails high. I could not leave the matter there and I raised it in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
House. I was talking recently to the honourable Member for Medway (Dame P. Fenner), who was a Minister at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to whom I had addressed a question in the Chamber some time ago. She said that those old Acts no longer apply. Some of my honourable Friends and I were pleased, because if the Acts no longer apply, the land can be restored to the people. Some Conservative Members have said that they are landowners. They may hold former common land that once belonged to the community and they may have been given that land on condition that they maintained the hedgerows in perpetuity. I have not read all 4,000 Acts of Enclosure—some are contained in manuscript rolls—but every pre-1840 commons enclosure Act that I know of contains that condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Approximately 10 years ago I went to the Department of the Environment for a cordial meeting at which my non-professional interpretation was confirmed. I then wrote to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Earl Ferrers, the Minister of State, replied to my letter. In my letter I had stated that it was conceivable that during the previous 40 years millions of pounds of taxpayers' money had been provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the grubbing up of hedgerows which were legally required perpetually to be maintained. I asked whether the Ministry was prepared to do a deal and to introduce a hedgerows Bill to relieve it of that embarrassment. It was not prepared to do so, but that is another story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The response of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food brought delight to the National Farmers Union. Earl Ferrers said in his reply 10 years ago that the Ministry was not at fault because when an application was made for a grant to grup up a hedgerow, the applicant assured the Ministry that there was no statutory obligation to prevent him from carrying out the work or receiving a grant. The then Minister said that should it be drawn to the Ministry's attention that a grant had been paid for the grubbing up of a hedgerow that was subject to a requirement in commons enclosure legislation, that grant must be repaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not an uncharitable nor an unrealistic man. Several farmers are friends of mine. I have no wish for hundreds of farmers to be plunged into ruin and bankruptcy—the Government are doing pretty well without my assistance. I do not want us to go back 40 years to discover which farmers had a grant for the grubbing up of an enclosure hedgerow. I did not want to rock that boat, but the Government were not very helpful. They could have assisted me to regularise the position and to relieve people from the risk of being accused of having obtained public money fraudulently by disregarding statutory obligations that they may not know about. I have been disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggested to the conservation bodies that we needed a test case. I was given legal advice that there would be a real chance that a test case would succeed, especially if it were brought by, or on behalf of, a person who lived in the community and who could prove, whether in a motor car or not, that he had been visually disadvantaged. No such test case has been brought. The previous one, which is relevant to our considerations, was Pratt 
	<i>v.</i>Garnett in 1928, which upheld the law, although it was an ancient law which was probably in manuscript.

We must ensure that we do not so disregard an enclosure hedgerow which may not fit into the categories listed in subsection (4) that we remove protection from such a hedgerow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful clarification for the Committee if I quote clause 18(3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact that any work is permitted under this Act does not affect any prohibition or restriction imposed by or under any other enactment or by any agreement."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the obligations imposed on hedgerows by the Acts of Enclosure would still remain in force despite the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede the logic of the hon. Gentleman's intervention but that brings me to my next point, which is serious. The hon. Gentleman might feel that hedgerows are secure under that provision, which is not specific, as my amendment would be, but although the present Administration is aware of the legal position and although I have had correspondence from Agriculture Ministers at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food telling me exactly what the position was, I have recently heard a case which more than justifies the additional protection that I want to ensure for ancient hedgerows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the issue with the permission of my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), in whose constituency the example occurred and who has strongly supported my initiative. Last autumn the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, of which I have long been a patron, drew the attention of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the destruction of hedgerows in the area of the Blackshaw Clough, near Fishlake, which is just inside the metropolitan district of Doncaster, but an entirely rural area. That area is part of a drainage and flood defence scheme that involved the destruction of an enclosure hedgerow of ecological and enviornmental importance. The trust drew the Minister's attention to the fact that that hedgerow was protected in law. The Minister did not reply for a long time so, as a patron of the trust, I wrote to him to explain that the trust had presented clear evidence of the historic protection and to ask him to ensure that the trust received a reply. The nature of that reply is a sufficient justification on its own for my amendment. The letter that I received from Earl Howe, on behalf of the Minister, stated that the proposed works were cleared by the Nature Conservancy Council. I am not sure whether the Nature Conservancy Council was informed of the specific protection provided by the enclosure Acts. The letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As you will see from the enclosed copy of John Gummer's letter to the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, there is some uncertainty over the interpretation of local enactments."</p></blockquote>
The Yorkshire Wildlife Trust has no such uncertainty. The letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the circumstances we think it would be inappropriate to recover grant."</p></blockquote>
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in the knowledge that the hedgerow was an enslosure hedgerow and given the specific assurance that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
received some time ago about the conduct of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the matter, the Minister has paid the grant and refuses to recover it. In those circumstances, I have no alternative but to send details of the case to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration this week and ask him to investigate what is an almost perfect example of maladministration. If that investigation fails, I shall dig out another case in which public money was spent improperly and submit that to the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case opens a door that might have been more sensibly closed with proper cooperation from Government Departments some time ago. It is apposite, however, and coincidental that the case has arisen as the Bill is being discussed in Committee and at a time when a relevant amendment has been tabled. I have considerable pleasure in tabling my amendment, which would ensure that enclosure hedgerows that may not qualify under the category are provided specifically with the protection under the law which was introduced years ago and which has not been repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of my earlier point; it might strike to the heart of one or two hon. Gentlemen. If the laws do not apply, my hon. Friends and I and many thousands of people in our communities may cheer. Farmers would not; nor would the landowners. Perhaps landowners had more power in the past than they have today. They hold land on the condition that they must preserve and protect the hedgerows for all time. We are not justified in standing history on its head and removing a law that was considered right so long ago—or has the Conservative party so rejected the traditional values that it long supported that it can take a light-hearted view of the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hargreaves 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hall Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's argument. Birmingham city council is controlled not by the Conservative party but by the Labour party, and has been for some time. It is a substantial landowner and has served compulsory purchase orders for development purposes on a large area, which was formerly owned by landlords who are still resident in the area. One or two conservation groups have expressed worry about the rate at which hedgerows in and around the conurbation are being ripped out. Those hedgerows were part of what was previously common land. It would cost Birmingham city council a substantial sum to put that right. Given the city's finances, I scarcely think that it would welcome such action. I urge the hon. Gentleman to think carefully before using that argument as anything other than a pressure point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our interpretation of the law does not have to depend on the nature or political allegiance of a specific organisation. I do not know the position with regard to enclosure legislation for parishes around the city of Birmingham. Some of the hedges in that area could have been required to be protected perpetually, which is why I suggested a while ago that the conservation bodies should bring a test case. People from areas other than my own have written to me about the possibility of protecting a threatened hedgerow. I advised them to visit their local library, or wherever the county archives may be and examine the enclosure Act for their area. In several cases,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
the individual who was going to remove a hedgerow has been challenged by those who have taken my advice and the hedgerow has been saved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken similar action myself. I recall being told by a friend who is knowledgeable about such matters that a hedgerow not far from my home in my constituency was threatened. I wrote to the landowner, saying, "If you can't find the local enclosure Act go to Rotherham central library, where there is a copy ready for you to inspect, but I think that you have a copy in your estate office." The landowners looked in the office and found that Act. Then he said, with some remorse, that he had found it, and said that I was threatening him. I said, "I am not threatening you. I am merely saying that I know one individual well who frequently walks along a nearby footpath with his dog and would act as a private individual to challenge any removal of that hedgerow in court." The hedgerow still stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I await a reply from a farmer who has removed another hedgerow that is clearly shown to be protected by the 1810 enclosure award for his locality. He has pulled down the hedgerow and some of my constituents want to take action about that. There are many possibilities, but if we do not reflect past legislation in the Bill, we shall worsen the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fascinating though the discussion may be, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of local enclosure Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. The Bill is national in scope. Each local enclosure Act is different and requires different interpretation. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would be completely unworkable. I submit that clause 18(3) makes it clear that scope of the Bill does not include the enclosure Acts. It is therefore up to the court in each case to interpret the local Act. It would be folly to pass the amendment. The purpose of the Committee is not to interpret or clarify the enclosure Acts, it is merely to deal with hedgerows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. As I said, 4,000 such Acts were passed before 1840, when a general measure was established. There is considerable similarity between them and the Bill. For example, vast numbers of such Acts were passed in Yorkshire between 1810 and 1815. If the Committee wants, I can tell it the reason for that. During the great Yorkshire election, more money was spent on returning the eldest son of Earl Fitzwilliam, whose estate is based in my constituency, than was spent by the Conservative and Labour parties, between 1945 and 1983. He successfully contested the election, securing 11,000 votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following that expensive election, a vast number of enclosure Acts were passed that provided large amounts of land for the estate of that family—the members of that family were superb landowners, extremely noble and
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
forward-looking Whigs of the day. Those hundreds of Acts are very similar. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury should not try to mislead the Committee by suggesting that there are 4,000 quaint old pieces of legislation, all of which are entirely different. They have much in common, because they all rested on the assumption that land was to be taken from the community and given to an individual, with the major concession that the fields should be surrounded by hedgerows. There is no great difference between them. Vast though their numbers may have been, those Acts are identical in intention and character, which should not be weakened. That is why there should be a specific reference to those matters in clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Wentworth, who has a fund of knowledge and experience regarding the enclosure Acts which commands the repect of both sides of the Committee. I must tell him, however, that in my view enclosure hedges have little to do with the Bill, save that it affords them greater protection than now exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 gives local authorities the power to refuse notifications on historic, landscape or wildlife grounds. That calls for an environmental judgment. I do not believe that it is for local authorities, in the context of their functions under the Bill, to look into general obligations that attach to land or to the hedgerows on it. That is clearly a matter for the landowner or his tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that the Bill does not recognise the possibility of a local authority permitting the destruction of a hedgerow that may be subject to other restrictions. That is why clause 18(3) makes it clear that any work permitted under the Bill will not affect "any prohibition or restriction"—such as an enclosure Act—
	<br><blockquote><p>"imposed by or under any other enactment".</p></blockquote>
If approval to remove the hedgerow is secured through the notification procedure provided for in the Bill, an owner of land would not be able to use such approval to override any other obligation to maintain the hedgerow under an Act of enclosure, if such an obligation exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 2, the purpose of clause 6 is to allow the destruction of small hedgerow remnants without the need to notify a local authority. To require the notification of a hedgerow remnant, which must in any case be maintained under an Act of enclosure, would stifle the practical application of the clause. If there is an obligation on the landowner to maintain the hedgerow, it is for him to ensure that he does so. That is not a matter for the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My intention is to afford protection to hedgerows of value on environmental grounds. The Bill provides additional protection to enclosure hedges; it does not interfere with the provisions of the enclosure Acts. I hope that honourable Members will agree that the amendments, well intentioned though they are, are not necessary. I hope, too, that honourable Members will accept that the notification procedure will not be effective if authorities are invited to make wider judgments based on non-environmental factors. I therefore ask the honourable Member for Wentworth to withdraw his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely sorry that I cannot oblige the honourable Gentleman. I sought to intervene to suggest to him that there may be greater force and more value in amendment No. 2. Clause 6 refers to unprotected hedgerows and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A hedgerow is not protected if—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) it does not exceed twenty metres in length".</p></blockquote>
There may be some small hedgerows which are extremely short but very ancient which may enjoy existing protection under the enclosure Act. Under clause 6, that ancient protection could be questioned or endangered. That applies to small hedgerows less than 20 m in length. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
not happy that the honourable Member for Surrey, East should seek to reject amendment No. 2, which confirms an ancient protection that should continue. If the honourable Gentleman is resistant, I am prepared to go part of the way and withdraw amendment No. 1, but I certainly want to insist that amendment No. 2—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
