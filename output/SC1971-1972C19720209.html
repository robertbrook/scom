	<div class='title'>PROVISION OF VOLUNTARY VASECTOMY SERVICES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Amendment No. 1 proposed (2nd February),</i> in page 1, line 11, to leave out paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) after the words "giving of advice on contraception", there shall be inserted the words" and voluntary vasectomy (provided that the arrangements made for giving of advice on vasectomy shall include either the advice of a psychiatrist or advice given by a counselling service approved by the Secretary of State)", and after the words "seeking advice on contraception", there shall be inserted the words "and voluntary vasectomy"':—[
	<i>Mr. Abse.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I was not in command of the Floor when we rose last Wednesday, it was only because one of my hon. Friends was asking me a question. I invite him to continue asking his question because he had not finished. However, this is a very pleasant experience for me because it is the first time since I made my maiden speech that I have come to any meeting in the House knowing that I would be called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask you, Mr. Fitch, and the Committee to be indulgent of me this morning because the view I wish to put is not held generally in the Committee, other than partially by the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), who so brilliantly moved the Amendment last Wednesday, and by my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly ask the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), who is responsible for the Bill, to take a different view of me from that which he took last Wednesday and not to think that I am attempting any form of burlesque. Everything that I say will be aimed at putting
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
what I consider to be an enormously important view which is, nevertheless, opposed to that of the hon. Member for Derby, North. This does not seldom happen in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I view with some qualms the Report of the Simon Population Trust. I understand that there was some counselling given by the doctors who spoke to those who were to become patients, but we do not know what that counselling was. The operations took place only a year, or not much more than a year, before the conclusions were reached by the Simon Population Trust, or at least before it started interviewing all the people who had had the operations, which I believe took place in 1967–68. I am not certain of this because I have only read it in a document. The Simon Trust published its Report in 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be difficult to argue that there had been enough time for people to be examined after the operation had taken place. The hon. Lady the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill), who made such a moderate speech on Second Reading, was most careful, owing, no doubt, to her medical experience and perhaps to similar mistrust of the amount of time that had elapsed between the operations and the publication of the Report of the Simon Trust. I do not want to quote from that Report; most of it is not relevant to the Amendment and I wish to stick as strictly as possible to the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke at some length last Wednesday, and with his usual kindness and moderation. He spoke of the doubts of local authorities about counselling:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I undertake to consider issuing specific guidance to local authorities if the Bill is passed, highlighting and specifying in an unusual degree—unusual in the sense that we shall not have specified this topic before—the necessity and the relevance of counselling in the matter of the provision of vasectomy services by local health authorities."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C</i>, 2nd February, 1972; 
	<i>c.</i> 47.]</p></blockquote>
I should have though that that was almost unnecessary because it was the least that any Minister could promise who did not frown on the introduction of such a far-reaching and controversial Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that I can remain in order by referring to the consultative document already published, setting out the proposals that the Government have in view for the development of the health services, amongst which is the proposal that all local health authorities should lose their existing powers—and that would involve these existing powers"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C</i>, 2nd February, 1972; 
	<i>c.</i> 49.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
He was really saying that the Government would take everything over. This caused me to say that that was exactly what I was terrified of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go too far on this, because I do not wish to incur your displeasure, Mr. Fitch. Suffice it to say that nothing in the Minister's speech lessened my theory that the Government should never take over any responsibility in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Social Services (Mr. Michael Alison)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for giving way on this narrow point, and I seek to reassure him. When I talked about the Government taking over the responsibilities of the local health authorities, I meant that it would be in the context of laying before Parliament a fresh National Health Service Bill in which the whole question of principle and practice in the provision of family planning will once again come before the House. There will be the fullest possible opportunity for hon. Members to debate this great issue afresh before any further legislation is implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leo Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman replies, I wonder if, in commenting on the Minister's view, he would not also have to consider that practices which have become established as the result of the passing of this Measure would almost inevitably already have been carried over into the National Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) for dotting one or two of the i's before I had uttered them. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has, with his usual courtesy and helpfulness towards the Committee, tried to reassure me. However, I fear that he has achieved precisely the opposite, for he has convinced me of the point made by the hon. Member for Pontypool. This is what I meant when I referred at our first sitting to my horror and terror.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to return to the Amendment, I should like to quote the words of the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton):
	<br><blockquote><p>"We all know from past experience the difficulties that arise from imposing on the Secretary of State responsibility for authorising some standard, some permission, or some licence under which services may be given.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It has proved troublesome enough in the case of the Abortion Act, under which the Secretary of State has responsibility for granting licences to nursing homes in which abortions may lawfully
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
take place. We all know the difficulties that have arisen there. But it is much more complex to stipulate, specify, and approve of a specific form of counselling service."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C</i>, 2nd February, 1972; 
	<i>c.</i> 30.]</p></blockquote>
That is precisely the point which worries me. We are talking glibly about counselling services, but such services can be given only by men and women who are as fallible as are members of this Committee. It is conceivable that some members of the Committee are more fallible than most counsellors on these matters, but the reverse may also be true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing which is certain, however, is that, if this sort of activity is to receive the blessing not only of the law but also of the Government, we must be extremely careful about what we mean when we talk about counselling and about what counsellors are to say to parents who are in this sort of trouble. I shall not speak of what many people would say if they were told that they needed outsiders to tell them how to run their lives and get over their problems. That would probably necessitate the use of four-letter words, which I should not dream of doing. However, it is certainly not known that the majority of people who get into family troubles want outsiders to tell them how to get out of those troubles or would willingly receive outside advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to discuss what should be put across—a relevant expression these days—to the poor couple who find themselves being counselled, perhaps as a result of the suggestion of a psychiatrist that they should go for advice on mending their lives or perhaps simply in search of a way to stop future life. I should like to speak about the legal advice which they may be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phillip Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we may follow the thread of the hon. Gentleman's argument, is he using the word "poor" in the financial sense or in the sense of misfortune? Does he assume that everybody who seeks this advice is unfortunate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I should do—and I am sure that I could not possibly do it if I used better English—would be to try to mislead the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), and such is his percipience that that would not be an easy task. Though I may have used the word wrongly, I feel sure that the hon. Gentleman understood that I was speaking in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
sense of "poor in spirit". Their homes might be breaking up or they might be in trouble of one sort or another and, at the last ditch, the advice of their doctor might be to see a psychiatrist, who, in his turn, might send them to counsellors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take first the question of the legal advice which I think it absolutely essential that such a family should receive from the counsellors. By "legal advice", I mean expert legal advice on the position in which they may put themselves as a result of a vasectomy. Although the hon. Member for Derby, North last week reminded the Committee, with his usual unfailing courtesy, that legality had nothing to do with the Amendment, I beg to differ. The question of legality must surely come into counselling of the unfortunate couple of whom we are speaking. What are they to be told? Would it be right that a couple should go for advice on their future lives and should encounter the possibility of being advised that the husband should have an operation which would for ever make him sterile? We have to use the words "for ever" because that is what the hon. Member for Derby, North has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the husband and wife, who, after all, usually calls the tune, should know where they stand if they should opt for this mutilation. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] That made the hon. Member for Derby, North laugh. Let me say at once that I did not intend to make him laugh. If he thinks that I am exaggerating in calling this operation a mutilation, I ask him to think again. However open-minded he may be, he must admit that any form of operation is a mutilation. It may not be an evil mutilation and it may be one which is absolutely necessary for the health of the patient, but the clients of the counselling service must at least be told where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the legal basis we have for discussing this matter is infinitesimal. There has been no decision. 
	<i>The Times</i>, which is not usually backward in these matters, has agreed that the legality of such an operation is not fixed. This is the sort of thing that I think should be brought before such a couple as I referred to earlier who are receiving counsel. I hope that I am not trying anyone's patience. I feel strongly that it is essential that, if counselling is to be given, it should be full and should point out all the possible dangers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
I fully realise that what Lord Justice Denning said was in a minority judgment by three judges. But Lord Justice Denning is not a man whose views I easily reject, although the views of the other two judges must not be rejected out of hand. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair) wishes to intervene. If not, perhaps he will hold his peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a husband undergoes an operation for sterilization … without just cause or excuse, he strikes at the very root of the marriage relationship. The divorce courts should not countenance such operation any more than the criminal courts. Lord Justice Denning went on to limit severely the category of ' just causes'. He acknowledged that preventing the transmission of hereditary diseases could be such a cause, but he then continued: 'Where a sterilization operation is done so as to enable a man to have the pleasure of sexual intercourse without shouldering the responsibilities attaching to it, it is illegal'."</p></blockquote>
For a judge of the importance of Lord Justice Denning, whose opinions on freedom of the individual have been rated so highly, that is a categoric statement which must be made known, in my humble view, as well as statements by the other judges. I apologise if the hon. Member for Derby, North does not like my quoting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not become too involved in this case, but the hon. Gentleman surely knows that in the case of Bravery v. Bravery the two parties concerned had not both given valid consent to the operation, and the case of the plaintiff was that the husband had had the operation despite her and without her knowledge and consent. That is not the kind of situation we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, what he has just said is not relevant to the quotation from Lord Justice Denning that I have just read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very relevant to the words "without due cause", which Lord Justice Denning used before the 
	<i>obiter</i> into which he then launched on the question of sex and pleasure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the hon. Gentleman means "just cause". But let me read the quotation again so that he will understand that this is a different part of Lord Justice Denning's speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He acknowledged that preventing the transmission of hereditary diseases could be such a cause,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
but he then continued: 'Where a sterilization operation is done so as to enable a man to have the pleasure of sexual intercourse without shouldering the responsibilities attaching to it, it is illegal'."</p></blockquote>
There is nothing non-categoric about that. There was no doubt in the mind of the judge who made that statement as to the situation. I agree with the hon. Gentleman—and I am surprised that he did not take up the point because it is legitimate—if the man was going in for the operation for that reason. But how can it be proved? How does the counselling service prove it? How does Lord Justice Denning prove it? How can anyone? No one can prove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that this is a very difficult matter to determine. How can it be determined if a man is questioned by the Simon Trust and says, naturally enough, that the main reason he wanted the operation was to relieve his wife of the difficulties of being made infertile? How can anyone say that he said that only to put the responsibility on his wife? How can anyone say that he was not speaking the truth? No one can say that. It is a question of judgment, and Lord Justice Denning's judgment was that this operation should not be performed in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate his remarks to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your rebuke, Mr. Fitch. I shall earnestly attempt not to cause you to call me to order again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The end of the quotation from Lord Justice Denning was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'The operation then is plainly injurious to the public interest.</p></blockquote>
I want the counselling people to have to point out this sort of matter to their clients. Lord Justice Denning continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'It is injurious to his wife and any woman he may marry, to say nothing of the way it opens to licentiousness; and, unlike contraceptives, it allows no room for a change of mind on either side. It is illegal, even though the man consents to it.'"</p></blockquote>
The reason I have troubled the Committee by reading that quotation is that it is unlikely that any other Member, with the exception of my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell and the hon. Member for Pontypool, would read it. Any one of us might have done so, but it happens that I have done it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
As the Committee has talked at great length about the Simon Trust Report—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the point of the importance of counselling on the legal aspect of the question, would he venture the view under what statute the operation may be illegal? Is it under the Offences Against the Person Act? How does he see the position legally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. I wish he had not interjected, simply because I do not pretend knowledge of matters legal other than from a purely common sense view. I do not know the answer to that. However, the article in the 
	<i>British Medical Journal</i> of 21st March, 1970, goes into the history of the legality of operations, a question which was perhaps first tackled in 1604 by Lord Chief Justice Coke. I am sorry that I cannot help my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell further on that point, but he was right to ask me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Committee has been so helpful to me, I am getting on, from my own point of view, at speed, and though I cannot resist any interruptions, the fewer interruptions I have the more will the Committee be saved from the length of my discourse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg my hon. Friend's pardon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me hasten to add that what I said was in no way aimed at my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell. No intervention of his would upset me in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, a lot of weight has been attached to the Simon Trust Report. It is my job to attempt the difficult task of convincing those hon. Members who, though open-minded, look on the Amendment with slight scepticism. I want to put forward another view on vasectomy and to point out how clients for a vasectomy should be counselled when they seek such counsel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the views of Professor Hubert Campbell of Cardiff, which have not been made public prior to this, so far as I am aware. I shall leave out the introduction to the paper, and I shall leave out as much as I easily can for the convenience of the Committee. Nevertheless, I am sure that the Committee will want to hear this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
because it puts so succinctly the other side of the case. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why has the man come to seek surgical intervention? Frequently the cause will be the condition of the wife, gynaecologic or obstetric, sometimes medical or psychiatric, occasionally surgical. It is essential that a full consultation should take place with those doctors responsible for the medical management of the wife to assess exactly what are the factors involved and what are the risks attached to them.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Sometimes the cause will be social or economic, and again it is essential to make an exact diagnosis of the situation and its implications with any professional social workers concerned. Possibly the couple consider their family complete."</p></blockquote>
These must be the preliminary thoughts of those who are to counsel the couple, and it is very important that these should be deep thoughts and that the couple should be advised not just from one point of view but from all points of view about the operation that the male may be advised to undergo, with the consent of the wife, which is not always easy. The quotation continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nearly always there will be complications due to failure of various techniques of family limitation which may be abstinence or hormonal, rhythmical, or mecho-chemical control. Again it is important that the doctor should be quite clear what is the situation so far as marital intercourse is concerned and that the patients have some understanding of its implications and what it means to their married lives."—</p></blockquote>
that is, for either the male or the female to be sterilised, the male in perpetuity.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Frequently there will be additional marital stress and anxiety which may require skilled counselling."</p></blockquote>
I am sure this is true. I am sure that the counselling must be skilled. It must not be done by people who set themselves up as counsellors without having the necessary skills, the necessary experience to counsel people about the whole of their future married lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one stops to think about what is being discussed in the Bill, it is a matter of such importance and of such seriousness that it behoves hon. Members to think most deeply about what they may be letting young married couples in for by supporting a Bill of this nature. Professor Campbell went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These investigations will take time and trouble, they will involve seeing both partners of the marriage either separately or together. When they are complete the precise nature of the problem in each individual case will emerge and the possible solutions may be examined."</p></blockquote>
This is another difficulty in the Amendment. Even if it were accepted—which would at least give some safeguards to
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
these people, which is why I support it so strongly—it is not just a matter of providing that there shall be a counselling or psychiatric service. It is a matter of finding highly experienced people with the time to do the work. Ask the psychiatrists of Britain today whether they have the time to spend with families who cannot look after themselves, unless they are literally weak mentally. Ask the psychiatrists whether they have the time to delve into each and every problem that is set before them by a worried and distraught family doctor or panel doctor of parents with whom he has had some trouble, and so he sends them along to the counsellors for advice from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unthinkable that they should not have medical advice at their disposal for counselling purposes, and that is why the Amendment says that they should have
	<br><blockquote><p>"either the advice of a psychiatrist or advice given by a counselling service approved by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
If the Bill is to come under the aura and have the blessing of the State, then the counsellors must be approved by the State. Does anybody believe that the Department of Health has so much spare time that it will be able to ensure that all people who should go to counsellors approved by the State will get the full treatment? Will it be insisted upon that they put the legal side 
	<i>pro</i> and 
	<i>anti</i> for the operation of vasectomy? Will the counsellors be trained in some special way? What is a counsellor? Is he just a social worker? Can anyone tell me what the qualifications for a counsellor are?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a friend who was a very good social worker, but what qualifications did he have? How would my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and his Ministry weigh up and decide whether a counsellor was fit to tell other people how to run their lives? How would the Ministry be certain under the terms of the Amendment? I want to make sure that the Amendment, if passed, is acted upon by the Ministry by making certain that all the people concerned in founding these counselling groups, or whatever their name may be, are fitted to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My friend was a social worker of the greatest merit, I have no doubt, and perhaps purely on the grounds of being a social worker, he should merit acceptance by the Ministry as a paid counsellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I support the Amendment because I want safeguards for couples who may be misguided enough to be led by their overworked doctor, or by their psychiatrist, to go to such a counselling service. I want to make certain, as no doubt the hon. Member for Pontypool does, that the counselling service is of the highest proficiency. Those who provide the service must not be ordinary people. They must be dedicated people if they are to do their job properly, and they must have the necessary experience for the job. They must not be young people. They must be people of maturity and experience of a rare kind if they are to be fit to counsel other people on how to mend their lives.

To the delight of the hon. Member for Derby, North the Government have given overall blessing to the Bill, but I feel for the hon. Gentleman. He is delighted that he has the Government's overall blessing for his short-lived Bill, but let him not tell me that that clears up the matter and that my speech is unnecessary. It is necessary for the Committee to wake up and see what is involved, and for those who have a conscience to examine carefully where this leads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all right for the hon. Member for Derby, North. I am not being touchy, but I saw him laugh. I am delighted that he can see humour in what I am saying, but it is not humorous for the couples who may be misdirected by counsellors. There is no humour in it for the family man who has had a vasectomy operation because of advice from counsellors who do not know what they are doing and then, by some terrible misfortune, his wife dies and he wants to marry again and start another family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell has a large and wonderful family. Had he taken advice after his first three children were born, no doubt he would now be a vasectomised ghost.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making some interesting remarks about the hon. Member for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and others, but he must return to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Fitch. I shall return to Professor Hugh Campbell's paper. I apologise to my hon. and medical Friend for not being able to repeat what I said when he was not here, because to do so would be tedious repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want the hon. Member to get back to Professor Campbell. I want him to return to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the Committee for leniency in this matter. I said at the beginning that there are only two hon. Members on the Committee who oppose the Bill. I bow to your ruling, Mr. Fitch, but it would be a sad day for the Committee if the views of those who oppose the Bill were limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was trying in quoting from Professor Campbell's paper—and I quoted only a small proportion of it—is that it is a view which is utterly opposed to the view of the Simon Trust. How is the Committee to form an opinion on an Amendment as important as this if it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
cannot hear the views of hon. Members on what counsellors should do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the exception of the hon. Member for Pontypool, my hon. Friend the Member for Chigwell and myself, hon. Members on this Committee have not had strong stipulations to make about the Amendment. They seem to be content with the lack of security in the Simon Report. Far too little time was given to the making of the Report. It is a skimpy document, and it is connected—it would be surprising if it were not—with doctors who carry out this operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Campbell went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At this stage"—</p></blockquote>
that is the stage when all possible solutions are examined by the counsellors—
	<br><blockquote><p>"both partners must be seen together as the problem is that of a marriage partnership not that of separate individuals and it is at this stage that the moral issues should be discussed. If the couple have clear ideas on the moral issues involved in so far as their own consciences are concerned this simplifies matters, but usually they will have very confused ideas which they should discuss with the priest, minister or counsellor before taking any decisions."</p></blockquote>
That is good advice, which counsellors should heed, that couples should seek the advice not only of their family doctor, but also of their priest, minister or counsellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Campbell goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The doctor should not under-emphasise the seriousness of the issues concerned, but on no account should he impose his moral judgment on the patients".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that is right. It would be only too easy for counsellors, however experienced, unwittingly to impose their personalities on the momentarily unstable couple whom they are interviewing. It must be remembered that all too often the couple are just looking for an escape from their present difficulties. Professor Campbell's last sentence on that aspect of the matter is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Their conscience must be respected".</p></blockquote>
He then deals with the medical aspects of the operation, and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Similarly, the physiological and psychological effects of the operation should be explained and any possible fears of impotence, loss of virility or change or personality be brought to the surface".</p></blockquote>
To comply with your request, Mr. Fitch, I want to finish this as soon as I can, but surely it would have been wrong of me to have left that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
The professor's view of the legal issues is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Finally, the legal aspects would be discussed and attention drawn to the risk that the operation may be irreversible if the wife were to die and the widower wished to remarry or if the living children were to die in an accident".</p></blockquote>
How sad it all is. Out of respect for your admonitions, Mr. Fitch, I had better not read the rest of this document. I shall hope to find an opportunity of reading the rest of it at a later stage of the debate on the Bill, because every word of it is relevant to those who would wish to form some judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that I had it in me to be a Disraeli, or a Churchill, so that I could overwhelm the Committee with my personality and impress hon. Members. I wish that I had the logic of the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Powell), or the touch with words which some hon. Members have so that I could make a more succinct contribution to the debate. I wish that it were possible to influence the whole Committee, and particularly the hon. Member for Norwich, South, for whom I have the greatest affection, but I fear that the Committee's mind is set. The Bill was born of the Simon Trust Report. That may cause laughter, but that is precisely what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not have been possible to introduce the Bill 20 years ago. As I said on Second Reading, if we continue to think as sloppily about Government interference in the private lives of the citizens of this country as we are beginning to to do now, and if Parliament invites the nation as soon as any difficulties arise to rush to advisers who will advise vasectomies or some such operations, I fear that within a few years the horror of the killing of unwanted old people will be raised in the House again, because of the feeling that with the decreasing numbers of youth in the country such a Bill will find acceptance. On that day I shall leave this House, rather than have any part in such a Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it will save the Committee a great deal of time if I say that I completely reject everything said by the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) in the last few minutes about the relationship of the State to the individual and the individual conscience. The hon. Member and I obviously have very different
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
philosophies about how society should be conducted. We are both upholders of liberty, but his concept of liberty is different from mine. My concept of liberty is that, insofar as legislation can permit it, greater choice, and greater opportunity for exercising that choice, should be given to individuals. I think that the Bill gives additional choice to those who want different ways of limiting the growth of their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The undertakings which have been given during the discussion on the Amendment add to that freedom. The procedures which should be followed and the attitude to be taken by the Department have been specified. The undertakings given at the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) will add to the effectiveness of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about vasectomy in the context of the Amendment, we are considering a novel form of contraception, and we must take it for granted that it is an irreversible form. Because of that, it is a new departure and a new challenge. The terrifying prospects, in the view of the hon. Member for Yarmouth, appear against the background of our general cultural and social norms. Over the years, through dark centuries of superstition, we have accumulated in our philosophy, no matter how emancipated most of us appear to be, our ideas of virility, manliness and all the things that go with it. There is a dark part in many people's minds. The result is that when even modest forms of contraception are contemplated it has a bad effect on family relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attitudes are often subconscious, particularly in men, and like it or not, when vasectomy above and beyond other forms of contraception is discussed or anticipated in a family all the old fears and beliefs about the role of man in society are bound to be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk about a counselling service and providing additional advice, though not to the detailed extent that the hon. Member for Yarmouth discussed it. I thought that he was going to advocate that everybody from the tax inspector to the mother-in-law should be called in to give advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to put words into my mouth. The mother-in-law is likely to be a person
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
of some experience. I should not write her off. I should not write off experience as a qualification for counsellors doing this kind of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is right. In fact, with a mother-in-law like mine I dare not disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Good advice from experienced and concerned people is always welcome. I was not writing off experience, any more than the hon. Member for Yarmouth was writing off youth when he spoke of his hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford). We agree that both youth and experience are valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about additional psychiatric counselling. There is still a gap between those who, with the progress of technology, social organisation, family responsibilities and economics, are fairly well adjusted to the demands of modern life, which include overpopulation, and those who have a dark part in their minds. Thorough counselling is necessary, both before and after vasectomy, for those who might have feelings of guilt, quite apart from the situation which arises when the children are tragically killed or the wife of the first marriage is no longer alive. Counsel is needed in a normally happy marriage before and after vasectomy. There is a background feeling that, in some way, vasectomy is a contravention of the law of nature, and I have been glad to note that both my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) and the Minister are prepared to make a large concession on counselling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admire the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North has conducted the Bill. I thoroughly agreed with his remarks last Wednesday, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I want to look very carefully, and I know that my hon. Friends will, at the form of words which the Government are proposing in a circular to the local authorities, should the Bill become law. If I was not satisfied with it, I would be happy to consider on Report an Amendment in general terms covering vasectomy where approved methods of counselling have been followed".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C</i>, 2nd February, 1972; 
	<i>c</i>. 47.]</p></blockquote>
That is enough for me. It gives me the reassurance I needed. I knew that my hon. Friend the Member for Derby,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
North had approached the subject in a responsible and thorough manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I further reassure my hon. Friend? When I attempt, as I hope to, to get further guidance on at least the loose lines of thinking in the Minister's circular, I hope to see some reference in it to counselling after the operation, and not merely before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's additional point. It adds strength to the point that I was making in his favour: that, as a consequence of the discussion in the Committee, undertakings have been given by the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had undertakings from my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) will not be misled into believing that undertakings genuinely given by the sponsor of a private Member's Bill are the same as the limited undertakings, and certainly not affecting post-vasectomy counselling, by the Minister. Nor have we received any undertaking that we shall see the circular before the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) has saved the Committee a good deal of time, because he has said what I intended to say. I need not repeat it, except to say that if the Minister were to be as specific and forthcoming in his undertakings as my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North has been in his appeal for undertakings on the circular and on the kind of thing that should be included in it on both pre- and post-vasectomy counselling, I, and possibly my hon. Friend, would be more satisfied than we are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even though the hon. Member for Yarmouth is associated with us in the Amendment, I do not think that anything like that would necessarily satisfy him. He is entitled to his emphasis, and I am entitled to mine. I do not presume to speak on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another doubt has been put into my mind by an article in the 
	<i>Journal of the American Geriatric Society</i> by a man of eclectic information, a Dr. Roberts of the Palm Beach Institute for Medical Research, I do not know Dr. Roberts
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
from Adam; all I know is that he is not Adam. He has written a learned article, and I have to take much of what he says on trust because I read medical articles in the same way as I read Dostoevsky—when I come to the difficult words I skip them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Roberts has introduced another aspect of the cultural difference, not between generations, but between areas of the world, which is the product of environment and diet. He has doubts about the effects of vasectomy on the men of the affluent West, the people of good diet and high sugar intake, compared with its effects on people of the poverty-stricken East. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Great caution should be used in projecting the purported innocuousness of mass vasectomy programmes conducted in famine-threatened countries (such as India) on to the inhabitants of relatively affluent countries. There may be marked differences in the immunologic responsiveness to vasectomy by different populations, for nutritional and other ecologic reasons. For example, there is considerable evidence that the diathesis, to the hyper insulinised state, is enhanced in the United States by ingestion of large amounts of sugar and abundant calories. The metabolic and tumorigenic effects of androgenic action in the hyper insulinised state have also been detailed previously. Furthermore, in the United States the routine mass immunisation to multiple diseases and the repeated exposure to various drugs have activated the population's immune and insulinogenic mechanisms to a high degree".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying that if we eat too much the operation is more dangerous?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is what it boils down to. I am again obliged to an intervention for shortening the proceedings. It is dangerous to eat too much, and the doctor makes the point that, because we have already burdened ourselves with that danger, the vasectomy operation might heighten it. One would be doing less than justice by failing to bring that to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North, thoroughly interested as he is in the subject, will want the opportunity to contest what I say. I shall be glad to hear, not so much his reassurance but that he has taken it into account, as I am sure that he has. My point is that in any circular that is issued attention should be drawn not only to the fact that it is, by comparison, a new departure in contraception, or in mass birth control, but that it has impli-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
cations, as outlined at length by Dr. Roberts, and with much greater brevity and wit by my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will bear those two points in mind, and I look forward to receiving any assurances that he can give on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One last point must be made. The Under-Secretary of State told us last Wednesday, in probably the first speech from a Conservative Minister, since I have been in the House, of which I thoroughly approved—it makes a nice change—that his Department accepted the principles of the Bill but foresaw administrative, financial, and organisational difficulties arising from an acceptance of the Amendment. Those are matters which the Minister must bear in mind, and I respect that, but there is a certain dichotomy in that he is prepared to accept the principle of the Bill, but, he cannot support the Amendment. If the principle of thorough counselling is accepted, it is somewhat inconsistent not to apply practice to back it up. It is unfortunate, therefore, that while allies like the Minister are welcome, he cannot follow up his embrace of the principle with action in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that my interest in the circular is not based on semantics. My purpose is to ensure that the best practices now followed by the most thorough, committed, and dedicated counselling services, become universal. In no way am I trying to inhibit the Bill. I think that these are principles which its sponsors really want to put into practice. If the Committee has produced anything worth while it is that, by evolution as it were, certain ideas are in people's minds now which apparently were not there at the beginning of the Committee stage, and we are able to explore all the difficulties likely to arise from a vasectomy operation and try to anticipate them by proposing an adequate counselling service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the view expressed earlier—and I say this with no disloyalty to my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool—that there is a certain dichotomy in the phraseology of the Amendment in calling for advice by a psychiatrist or a counselling service. Nevertheless, I think that by widening the terms of the Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
my hon. Friend has done the Committee a great service. With a repeated request for reassurances about the two difficulties posed by vasectomy in relation to our cultural heritage, and those posed by the identification of certain health complications, I look forward to hearing both from the Minister and from my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kin-nock) in welcoming the undertaking that has been given to the Committee. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) in moving the Amendment struck a chord in the Committee. We were looking for something like this, but I am afraid that I cannot agree with the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) spoke at some length, and at the end of his speech asked for gifts from the gods in the form of the eloquence of a Churchill, and so on. He should have added, "and the brevity of my hon. Friend for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell)", and I shall try to take that gift to myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that on an Amendment of this kind so many experienced Parliamentarians do not want to make Second Reading speeches. We can keep within the rules of order and not quite make them but go very close to doing so. I wish to address myself to some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool in moving the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the Amendment in its present form, because I have to see it against the totality of the Health Service. My hon. Friend is asking for psychiatrists at a time when 45 per cent. of hospital beds are occupied by people with mental disorders, and a total of 773 psychiatrists in the National Health Service. It would be an unfair burden on the rest of the National Health Service if great numbers of psychiatrists were specified for the purpose of providing this service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our speeches not only do we, as Members of Parliament, exercise ingenuity in keeping in order, but we are brave, in that we expose ourselves to criticism. The hon. Member for Yarmouth spoke with passion, and I was interested in the emotive language he used in arguing against the Amendment. His philosophy appears to require pleasure with responsibility. He is very anxious that counselling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
should be provided, but I noticed that throughout his speech his approach was entirely masculine. He was not thinking about the pleasure of females.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool at least addressed himself to what I think is the whole basis of the Amendment and of the Bill, which is to relieve anxiety in people. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool addressed himself to the anxiety of people who elect to choose this form of contraception. But that is only a part of a much wider anxiety for which we have responsibility in the rest of the Bill. Because of that, I feel that the wider anxiety must take precedence over the smaller anxiety which my hon. Friend so eloquently put forward. I know that he will forgive me when I say that, like all of us, he has many personalities under one waistcoat, and sometimes when I listen to him I am uncertain whether I am listening to Pontypool the poet, Abse the actor, or Leo the lawyer. I hope that in his explanations of the points we are still to discuss, as on this one, we shall hear his well-trained, well-documented, and regimented arguments, rather than the flow of oratory which does not always convince.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to the precise nature of the undertaking given by the Under-Secretary. To those of us who know anything about the Health Service, a circular to a local health authority is 672/something/ something. I accept that the Minister cannot give the undertaking for which he was pressed, but before anything happens we should be able to consider the wording of the circular. We had a similar experience when we were considering the Immigration Act, when regulations to be issued by the Home Office to ports were different from the text of the Act, and there was some pressure to see what exactly the Orders were. Having read the Minister's speech, I am satisfied that he has the sense of the Committee on the safeguards that we want, and that there will be in the circular the kind of thing which I should gladly accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke about the health hazards arising from any surgical intervention. The hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) could tell us far more about that. No matter what action
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
is taken, there is always a health hazard. I have promoted a number of private Members' Bills on such matters as the large number of people who are dying from lung cancer because they inhale nicotine and tar into their lungs. Much as we should like to be a perfect society, we cannot legislate to cover all the possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that my hon. Friend is right in drawing attention to the possible medical hazards of this operation in later life, but I should put that against the medical hazards which occur in the sterilisation and abortion of women. We are talking about a tithe of those hazards. It is only my hon. and qualified Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Summerskill) who represents the fair sex. A good deal of the argument put forward by the hon. Members for Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) seemed to show an entirely masculine view of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They feel that the Amendment is needed to protect the men, that the Bill relates to men and that it does not matter much what women think, because they are second-class citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Chigwell would refute that. He has been able to build a family in his own image, a fact which We have this morning applauded, and I accept that he would probably give as much support to the suffragette movement as did Mrs. Emily Davidson in 1911. Nevertheless, throughout the debate the question of counselling advice has been looked at entirely from a masculine point of view, rather than from the point of view of the totality of marriage. Miltant words have been used. The hon. Member for Yarmouth called the operation a mutilation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) attacked me on the same issue. I had thought that vasectomy was an operation for men but, when talking to the Amendment, in relation to counselling I mentioned the family—the husband and wife, who would be there to be counselled—on each occasion. The operation is a vasectomy. We are not talking about female sterilisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, but the hon. Gentleman did not reach that point until two minutes past 11 o'clock, when he had already been on his feet for half an hour talking in general terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) and agree to look at the matter on Report, rather than accept the Amendment now. The hon. Member for Yarmouth is sincere in his dislike of the Bill. He would like to murder it. If he cannot do that, he would like to castrate it by removing its vital parts; and if he cannot remove the vital parts he would like to add something which would make them non-operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is fortunate to find his Bill being dealt with so early among the private Members' Bills. I think we should accept that my hon. Friend will get his Bill through the Committee. There is no doubt about that, we know it from our experience of the Parliamentary timetable—and all that we achieve by having lengthy debates, without sticking strictly to the point, is to lengthen the time during which the Committee sits and to prevent other very important Bills passing through their Committee stage. I hope that we shall be brief and to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only because the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) asked me some questions, and I got the impression, from the tone in which he put them, that if he obtained satisfactory answers he might consider withdrawing the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I address myself first to what one might call the medico-cultural aspect in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
West of the danger of the operation—if there is a real danger. I think that I can honestly say that the interests of the public are best served by leaving these matters where they properly belong, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) will support me in this—that is, in the realm of the professional expertise of those who are automatically and necessarily involved with the client or the candidate, namely, the general medical practitioner, who is bound to be involved at some stage, or the surgeon. I think that opinions will always be in a state of flux upon such matters. Views change, and fresh evidence comes forward. I think that it is superfluous to require the State formally or explicitly to support a responsibility which strictly lies with the profession and which has, I think, always been honourably discharged by its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the way in which we tie in the principle of counselling is important. I corroborate that the Government, in common with all the members of the Committee, are extremely anxious that counselling should be provided, and should be adequate. However, I should remind the hon. Member for Bedwellty that there are different means of achieving that aim, and I should go so far as to say that the terms of the Amendment may even be counter-productive to good counselling in the sense in which we all desire to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, some local authorities, finding that vasectomy is associated with a statutory requirement to be supervised by the State, and that a certain level, kind or specimen of counselling service must be available, that is what the Amendment implies—a service which has a national standard, as it were, and is supervised and monitored by the State, will hesitate before atempting to set up counselling machinery, in order to try to discover what the State requires by way of a standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only a short period of two years before the powers under the Bill will lapse. If the Amendment were accepted, it would take a little time for the State to set up a clearly-defined, agreed standard, specimen or type of ideal counselling service and, if, at the end of that time, local authorities which had hesitated about doing anything
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
found that there was required of them a counselling service which would need much greater resources locally they might say, "A year has passed during which the State has been deciding what sort of counselling service it wants, and it has now set us a very high standard. We shall, therefore, simply hasten slowly, since the obligation will be upon us for only another year."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result may even be that some local authorities would do literally nothing as a result of the ideal which the hon. Gentleman entertains of a State-sponsored and standardised service. It is better to accept the principle, and to rely upon the responsibility of local authorities to interpret the will of Parliament and the guidance which they may be given to set up the best possible counselling arrangements—over and above what they already have—in the short period of the Bill's life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What exactly has my hon. Friend in mind? Will he issue a circular at some time, at present unknown, about counselling, and about the sort of people who should carry it out, and so on? Will there be a circular, and will the Government give the service their blessing? I am in a muddle about exactly what my hon. Friend is going to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that context, and in order not to indulge in tedious repetition, I refer to my hon. Friend to the passage in the speech which I made earlier, and which he was good enough to quote this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being late, Mr. Fitch, but I was seeing patients in an effort to obtain the experience which may one day make me as wise as my mother-in-law. To reply to the question put by the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock), I think that he was talking about the possible immune response to the protein in the patient's own sperm occasioned by a sensitivity produced by other neurological processes which are being carried on in Western medicine. I think that this is an entirely theoretical possibility. It has never been shown in animals, and it is a hare—or rather the scent of a hare, since no-one has actually seen it—which has recently been introduced into medicine. There were questions in the 
	<i>British Medical Journal</i> about a month ago about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
long-term ill-effects of vasectomy. The short answer was, none, so far as is known. I think that will reassure the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not reassure me, having read the article referred to. I am in no position to assess it, and I suspect the hon. Member is in no position to assess it, but the view was put forward there that there was a correlation in certain circumstances between a form of phlebitis which occurred after vasectomy, and clinical cases were quoted in the paper. That was the basis upon which the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) rested. What amazes me is the extraordinary optimism which I believe is motivated by factors other than objective medical factors, and by population policies which have nothing to do with medicine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the intervention of the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) requires answer whatsoever, being entirely irrelevant to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee for more than a moment, but I should like to put a question to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that he laid too much stress on the undesirability of State interference in what is a private and professional matter, and I refer my hon. Friend to the words of the Amendment. One of the alternatives put forward in the Amendment is
	<br><blockquote><p>"… a counselling service approved by the Secretary of State …."</p></blockquote>
This does not mean that the counselling would be through a State agency. I ask my hon. Friend to consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate from which it is abundantly clear that we must get many issues clearer before the Report stage in order that we get a Bill upon the Statute Book which is acceptable to the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that one of the main arguments put forward contesting the need for such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
an Amendment as this was the first argument put forward by the hon. Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), that is, the phenomenal success rate as shown in the Simon Trust Report. Such phenomenal success rates are believed in in a dangerous fashion by the proselytisers, like the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford), who in 
	<i>The Times</i> yesterday presumably identified himself with a group of doctors who have suggested that they propose to preempt the position and will act as proselytisers for vasectomy in the National Health Service proper, Doubtless much will be heard of that elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not doubt that the Simon Trust figures are characteristic of what I regard as an extraordinarily sanguine approach which is dictated not by objective evidence but by political considerations, in the fuller sense of the term. This is bedevilling an objective appraisal of the effect of vasectomy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sponsor of the Bill and the hon. Member for Willesden, West (Mr. Pavitt) have consistently emphasised, on Second Reading and in the Committee, the favourable effects from looking at surveys of post-operative attitudes. Equally, anyone who has examined all the literature finds that there is all that evidence, on the one hand, but there is equally an abundant amount of evidence—which I hope is known to those experts upon whom the Minister places such remarkable dependence and reliance and who so modestly prepared their brief for him so that they described themselves as people of expertise in the highest quarters—to show that patient-oriented studies of individuals from psychiatrists and analysts mainly in America, who have had more experience than we have, have just as consistently emphasised the resultant psychological complications. That is the fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two sets of papers and approaches—those who are involved in the field doing the surveys giving these extraordinarily sanguine prognoses and those, largely psychiatrists and analysts who are dealing with patients, who are patient-oriented, and they constantly emphasise the resultant psychological complications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relevant to what we are discussing that at this moment, as will have been observed in 
	<i>The Times</i> of Monday, there
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
is a major controversy raging in the United States on the issue which we are discussing on the Amendment. After having vasectomy practised on a very much larger scale than in this country, there is now in the United States a serious controversy, as 
	<i>The Times</i> rightly indicated, as to whether the optimism of those who are urging vasectomy is justified, or whether the pessimism of those who are concerned about the psychological effects of vasectomy are justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that psychiatry is one of the great growth industries of the United States and one of the ways of making enormous sums of money for the medical profession there? They may be looking at it from a slightly biased point of view, as they see the dollars come rolling in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill goes through in its currrent form, knowing what consumer demand there has been for abortion, I can assure the hon. Member that under this Government there will be only two growth industries here—vasectomy and crime. The hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have taken the point. But if it is suggested that psychiatrists in the United States, people of high repute with international reputations, are influenced in their views by pecuniary considerations, it would be equally unwise and unfair to suggest that the views which have been put forward by surgeons in the United States who are privately practising vasectomy are dependent, not upon their genuine belief as doctors and healers, but upon monetary considerations. It is a very unworthy intervention and the only effect of interventions of that kind can be to undermine the confidence of the public, not only in those against whom the opprobium is intended, but by those who within the profession make such comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has already told us that we have to consider all these problems in relation to the cultural surroundings. Would he agree that the cultural surrounding in medicine are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
very different as between the two sides of the Atlantic, and therefore he is now defeating his own argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be drawn into commenting on what happens on this side of the Atlantic in certain fields like abortion, where, perhaps more categorically, the type of criticism that the hon. Member is so wildly making against the medical psychiatrists could be drawn. It is wiser that hon. Members, rather than being sidetracked in this way should seriously consider in addressing themselves to this Amendment whether there is a need for some form of psychiatric screening. We would be totally unwise if we ignored the current controversy within the United States, although it aroused the anxieties of the hon. Member for Yarmouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pavitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is aware that the Department of Health and Social Security has at its disposal the services of the Medical Research Council, of which I have the honour to be a member. The M.R.C. collects any material coming through, any reading in depth of the clinical consequences or psychiatric consequences, and the research work both in our own medical schools and universities and also reports such as that of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the Medical School at Yale. My hon. Friend is quite right that there are schools of thought in psychiatry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, on the clinical and psychiatric evidence, the Minister and the Department have to make up their minds about the propositions which are put forward and the evidence and research. The Department is in a far better position than we are because of the word-wide network that the Medical Research Council is able to draw upon to reach a conclusion about whether counselling should include this particular skill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detract from the expertise which is available to the Minister, but I do not believe that the men at the Elephant and Castle or the local councillors should determine who will be sterilised in Britain.

It is important that we should draw upon the experience of others—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw attention to the controversy in the United States which is directly related to this Amendment. There is the view, on the one hand, that there are serious psychological side-effects to vasectomy and, on the other hand, the view that these are being exaggerated, which is also the view of the Simon Trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all enjoy my hon. Friend's speeches, even when we are hearing them for the third time. He went into the question of the American opinions at great length on Second Reading. Whilst we all accept that there is controversy, would he address himself to the undertakings which we have heard from the Minister and the assurance which I have given the Committee that I will study very carefully what the Minister said? He can find the precise form of the Minister's assurance in col. 27 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of the debate in this Committee on Wednesday, 2nd February.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must contain his impatience. The less that I am interrupted—I have had about six interruptions in the few minutes that I have been speaking—the more I shall be able to develop my argument and perhaps that will shorten the proceedings and bring me to what my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North is anxious to hear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that when I spoke last time I drew attention to the American experience—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the time before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the time before. But in the meantime, because fortunately in the English-speaking world there are reverberations from one side of the Atlantic to the other, we have had this week in 
	<i>The Times</i> at least two statements drawing attention to what is occurring in America. As recently as 14th January, 1972, an important article, of which the Committee should be aware, appeared in the 
	<i>New York Times. The Times</i> commented on this earlier this week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The author is a distinguished person and regarded as an authority on the subject by the 
	<i>New York Times</i> and is con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
nected with the family service Organisation in Massachusetts and one of the serious factors that emerged from the article is that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There appeared to be a direct relation between dependent personality types and the chances of vasectomy as a method of birth control. Since vasectomy is foolproof and easy to obtain and called for no continued effort on their part for self-discipline".</p></blockquote>
the writer says that the report on which she is basing her statement says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We feel that vasectomy represented a real threat to the marriages we studied, leading in some cases to divorce, in some cases to emotional separations, and in most cases to less effective handling of their personal problems."</p></blockquote>
The argument is based on a report which has been prepared for the Family Service Association of America in which a sample has been recently investigated, and the results published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that a majority of people going in for vasectomy will necessarily be dependency types who have no sense of discipline or are not able to assume responsibility for their own roles. Many of them may be extraordinarily rational, having come to the conclusion that in the interests of their marriage it would be a good thing for a vasectomy to take place. However, it cannot be disputed that there is mounting concern in the United States that the early optimism is unjustified and that a disproportionate number of people with marital troubles are seeking vasectomy as a magical way of resolving their problems, and that it is possible, according to this very serious report, that vasectomy in these cases represents a real threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not everybody who goes in for a vasectomy is in marital trouble. They are not all necessarily of these personality types. However, it must concern the Committee that instead of evidence diminishing it is increasing that a significant minority of those who are obtaining vasectomy quite clearly are in need of considerable advice before they have this operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North is concerned that the Clause is not so intimidating as to drive people into the private sector. That is a persuasive argument. I have a feeling of 
	<i>déja vu.</i> This was the argument used during discussions
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
on the Abortion Act. Without developing that, far more abortions are conducted in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One realises how social approval in legislative form can activate and stimulate something, as in the case of abortions, so that nobody—not even the keenest abortionist—does not acknowledge that the number of private abortions today is far higher than the illegal abortions which they claimed were in existence at the time of the Abortion Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if we put forward the proposition, we must be careful that we do not put such restraints in the Bill that we shall create a private sector. Judging by the experience of the Abortion Act, that argument is unsound. The truth is that when we as parliamentarians—and local authorities, too—begin to give unqualified approval to a new form of birth control, there is little doubt that it will expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Norwich, South have identified themselves with a group of people who say they will go out as proselytes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is now talking about the general merits of the Bill rather than the Amendment. I wish he would return to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument I am putting forward is to meet the suggestion that there is no need for and we should not have an Amendment of this kind because it is too restrictive. With respect, I am being careful to keep within the rules of order. I was saying that, although at first sight the argument appears extraordinarily persuasive—and I am not saying that it is without some merit—we must treat such an argument with considerable caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the Ministry may now be saying, we have heard through the sponsor of the Bill that the Royal College of Psychiatrists has indicated its agreement with the principle of the Bill, but that it would wish to see an Amendment accepted, not precisely in the form I have put forward, but in the form which the sponsor read out. He made it quite clear on Second Reading that he dissociated himself from any direct connection with any statements which were made by the birth control movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to learn that the Royal College of Psychiatrists' letter which was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
read out was stimulated and activated as the result of approaches made directly to the Royal College by the birth control movement. The attempt to manipulate the Royal College was rather exploded in its face by the letter received by the sponsor of the Bill. The fact that, in principle, it wanted this Amendment is just one other example of the sorry trail which people will follow. I give this note of admonition to the sponsor in case they are manipulated by the same body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal College has put forward this view and no doubt will now be giving further consideration to the matter in view of the debate which took place on Second Reading. But it has asked for the Bill, and they are the people who realise the responsibilities that arise if there is more psychiatric intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's view is, in my opinion, rather curious. First, he has said that the maximum amount of counselling advice is necessary, but he goes on to refer to—and I am quoting from the First Sitting:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The overwhelming weight of evidence presented to the Committee …".</p></blockquote>
But when he spoke there had been no mention of anything except the Simon Trust, and I presume that was all he was talking about, because he intervened at an early stage in our Committee proceedings to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The overwhelming weight of evidence presented to the Committee and the Government … suggests that in the majority of cases vasectomy has no discernible effect upon mental health ".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C</i>, 2nd February 1972; 
	<i>c</i>. 22.]</p></blockquote>
But nobody on this side of the Committee has contended that in the majority of cases vasectomy has a discernible effect. What we are concerned about is the discernible effect, according to a great deal of evidence, upon the minority. The Amendment is concerned with the minority of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disturbed, as are other hon. Members, by the way in which the Minister so readily accepted the Simon Trust's evidence. Some caution is required as clearly there is considerable other evidence. We have had this curious argument presented again this morning by the Minister that, after all, we shall debate this matter again in a few years' time and therefore there is no need for cluttering up the Bill with this type of Amendment. I find that a dismaying
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
suggestion. The Minister says that there will be a need for a further debate on the whole range of birth control, including vasectomy, in a few years time so that there is no need to be troubled with it now. That is an extraordinary argument. If it is necessary to discuss the principles in a few years' time, do we in the meantime abandon all those who are coming to the Saturday clinics and leave them to their fate? Have we not a sense of responsibility to those people who may have a vasectomy in the next couple of years, as those who may have it subsequently? The Minister's is the least persuasive argument that I have heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it is at all true. I know it is an administrative nuisance. I realise that to the people at the Elephant and Castle it would be exceedingly vexatious that we should have to set up machinery to screen people which would be abandoned. That is very irritating to bureaucrats. It means that machinery is set up which is hard to build and which may be dismantled. But that has nothing to do with the fact that we are concerning ourselves with about the most important decision that human beings can make in their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a good enough reply to say that it is bureaucratically inconvenient, it overburdens the Department. Either the Department believes that there should be proper precautions taken to screen or it does not. If it says it cannot be done, that it cannot encourage the local authorities sufficiently strongly and cannot give adequate guidelines and criteria, then it has no business to be supporting the Bill. I hope it does not take that view because I want the Bill to go through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He was a skilled craftsman and when he told me the amount of money which was relevant to the background from which he came I was surprised that he had waited such a long time to see me. He complained that he had had the use of a hospital room for a very short time and had been charged a small fee. The circumstances seemed odd, as they would to other hon. Members if they found themselves with a constituent who was suggesting that he had a grievance because he had had the use of a hospital room for a short time. The hospital was not in my constituency.

I then discovered that this young man, on the advice of his general practitioner, had had a vasectomy performed privately and had had the use of the hospital facilities. He was not complaining about the fee that he had paid the doctor, nor about the fee that he had paid the surgeon. He had focused upon the fact that a small charge—£8—had been made by the hospital. He thought it was outrageous.
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
His indignation and zeal in criticising the hospital, in relation to the paucity of the amount, were totally disproportionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not need much discernment to see that on some deeper level he was left with resentment against the fact that the operation had taken place, and his resentment was focused not on the doctor or the surgeon, since he had signed the consent form, but on the hospital. I had to deal with it at the surface level, not at the deeper level. But if cases are already arising in my constituency of people trying to work through their resentment against an operation which is irrevocable or to work through feelings which should have been allayed by advice, either before or after, it must be occurring widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty puts forward the suggestion that there should be post-vasectomy advice and support, he is talking sense. The Minister has indicated the terms, without giving sufficient assurance to him on that sort of issue and without giving any assurance on the physical complications that may arise, that they should be brought to the attention of those who are seeking it. All I am left with at this stage, therefore, is the speech made by the Minister at the first Sitting of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that between now and Report, as there has been so much discussion in the Press within a week, the issues will be much more publicly canvassed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will be canvassed among the doctors as well. Not all of them have been alerted to the consequences or possible scale of vasectomy.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the great values of our institutions: they act as sounding boards—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know whether further medical evidence has much to do with the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that one of the great benefits of our institutions is that, through our public discussion of these issues, ultimate decisions are reached, not clandestinely, but only when the opportunity has been afforded to all who may be affected, professionally or otherwise, to submit evidence. I take the point of the hon. Member for Yarmouth who, no doubt, is also forming his own links to collate the necessary material so that on Report we can present to the House a complete bundle of informed evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North will be able to persuade the Minister to be far more forthcoming so that we shall have a draft in front of us before Report dealing with some of the main issues and acting as a guarantee that no local authority will embark upon vasectomy without having a full counselling service up to approved criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to have pationce, since the Report stage is yet to come, and to be conciliatory, as long as it is clearly understood that if there is no greater reassurance than we have received today we shall move Amendments on Report which will be assisted by the professional evidence which is now, stimulated by our discussions today and last week, being collated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Yarmouth, I ask him, as I know I can ask my hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty, to agree to the Amendment being withdrawn on the clear understanding that, unless more is forthcoming, the issue will be reopened at great length and in great detail on Report. I trust that, with that courtesy and reassurance coming from those of us who have put their names to the Amendment, we have reached a stage where we can be satisfied that this part of the Clause will go through in the knowledge that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
Ministry has been alerted to its responsibilities and that the Government understand that there is genuine cause for concern and that there is a need to give much firmer directives than have so far been proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise the depth of feeling of the hon. Member for Yarmouth and I know that there is a difference between us on the principle of the Bill, but I hope that, in order to achieve a better Bill, he will not create a situation where my hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty and I shall have to abstain, but will allow the Amendment to be withdrawn. He will well understand that that will mean that the matter has not been concluded by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Pontypool for his suggestion, which was charmingly put after his reasonable intervention this morning and at our last sitting. I had persuaded myself, by listening to his eloquence, that his Amendment was of the greatest importance, but I beg him to remember that he himself said a few minutes ago that the subject of the Amendment had hardly been touched upon, for there is much matter to come to hand during the next few days which could well alter the complexion of the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely for reasons of that kind that I think it wise to have the issue fully discussed on Report, should that become necessary. I am sure that the hon. Member for Yarmouth would not wish to create a situation in which it would be likely that the issue could not be discussed if it should prove necessary. I hope that he will take my point and, without in any way withdrawing from his position, which I respect, will concur with the hon. Member for Bedwellty and myself when, on the understanding that we reserve our position on Report completely and in the hope that there will be further negotiations between the sponsor and the Minister in the interim, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the promise of a nice, obstructive Report stage, I suppose that we can move on a little way before adjourning this morning. I feel that sometimes those who support a Bill come here only to sabotage it and I hope that those who have been observing our proceedings this morning will realise that without party whips this place could never function. Once again, we have had an illustration of the unsatisfactory features of the private Members' Bill procedure. However, I have moved the Amendment because I think that it would be undesirable to retain in the Bill the conditions which I wish to remove. I stress again that what we are talking about in the Bill are the conditions under which local health authorities may, by law, be allowed to provide the services which the Bill stipulates may be an extension of the Family Planning Act, 1967.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has reminded the Committee that we are legislating for an interim period. One hopes that all this can go into the National Health Service so that it can arrange its own affairs as seems best in the public interest. If it does not arrange itself to meet a substantial public demand, more and more people will be driven into the private sector. They are being driven into that sector, where there are no conditions, and it astonishes me that we should have interminable discussions on what seems to me so obvious and so full of common-sense—that is, that local authorities should use their own good judgment in providing services of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no obligation upon the local authorities to provide the service. We all know how slothful many authorities have been in availing themselves of the possibilities offered them under the provisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
of the main Act. Some have not attempted it, some object to it, others are doing it half-heartedly, others are imposing their own conditions as they are entitled to do, though Parliament, wisely, imposed no conditions. They are spending public money and they are given the responsibility for what they do. They are elected bodies, answerable to the electors, though one might think that the only people answerable to electors are Members of Parliament and that all the rest of the elected bodies consist of bureaucrats who want a lot of fussing around by middle-class "do-gooders" who always think that they know what is best for other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of patronising rubbish which is talked by such people about what is good for the working class has always roused my indignation. I would leave to the local authorities the responsibility for the services which they will by law be free to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should I wish to take the question of age out of this Bill? Because age has nothing necessarily to do with it. Age has to be taken into account when counselling is being provided for those who seek advice, but there are all sorts of conditions in which it is desirable for a vasectomy to be carried out on a man who is under the age of 30. The size of his family may already be adequate or further children in the family might put a burden on either the family or the State. I am not certain what the terms of the Clause mean. This is another drawback in our procedure, in that one moves an Amendment before hearing the arguments in favour of the main question. Any trade union branch knows the right order in which to put things when it comes to business, but we do not. I should have liked to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead) explain why he wants the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the patient has attained the age of thirty years, or otherwise on medical grounds".</p></blockquote>
I am not usually dense about parliamentary language, but I am not clear about that. However, I am against it because it is restrictive, and intended to be restrictive, and I do not think that such restrictions should be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with local authorities, who are not irresponsible people. I am sure that they will provide all the counselling service that anyone may reasonably wish to have before they will allow public money to be spent in this way. They can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
take everything into account in the particular circumstances of the case. That, I am sure, is enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Abse</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities will be able to decide whether age is a factor in particular cases, and whether, despite a person's age, vasectomy is desirable. That decision will be made when an application is made for a vasectomy. We are dealing, not with compulsory vasectomy, but with a voluntary operation. It seems to me that the whole matter can be left with local authorities, especially if they have guidance from the Minister. Everybody has to have guidance these days from bureaucrats or Ministers or Members of Parliament. Guidance is the word. No one can decide for himself. He must be told, advised, guided. Many people are not fit to decide anything for themselves. They must be shovelled into a counselling service before they are allowed to take advantage of what the State may provide for family planning reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Houghton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall finish my speech in the next few minutes, and I shall not allow myself to be interrupted by hon. Members who have taken an interminable time to explain their point of view to the Committee 
	<i>ad nauseam.</i> I shall complete my speech in time. I should hate to have to resume it next week, and probably some members of the Committee would not like it
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seriously suggest that this an unnecessary condition to impose upon local authorities. No doubt many hon. Members have received the report of the Marie Stopes Memorial Centre Domiciliary Vasectomy Service. It shows that out of 106 patients seen by the domiciliary service between June, 1970, and June, 1971, 41 were aged 30 or under, and 7 were aged 24 or under. The list contains, among others, a man of 27 with seven children, unemployed; a man of 29, five children,
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
a machine setter; a man of 25, five children, hod carrier; a man of 30, five children, engineer; a man aged 25, six children, wine drawer; a man of 29, five children, self-employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am dealing, not with the population issue, but with the issue of family planning. This is an alternative to other forms of contraception. Other forms of contraception are available in given circumstances from local authorities under the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act, 1967. All we are dealing with now, therefore, is an extension of that service, and the Bill makes that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other forms of contraception may, for various reasons, be unsuitable or unreliable. I mentioned a case in my speech last Wednesday in which vasectomy seemed to be the only satisfactory way of contraception in a family of two young persons where the contraceptive pill had distressing side effects on the wife and where other forms of contraception might provide constant strain and anxiety. That was a perfectly good case for voluntary vasectomy. It was done in the private sector, because there was nowhere else to go except the National Health Service, and in this case the man concerned felt that there was no reason why he should have the operation at the expense of the State—an attitude not to be despised, held by people who feel that they can decide their own affairs and pay for whatever treatment they wish to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is an extension of the family planning services, we should look at this service in that light, and leave the local authorities to decide the conditions on which they will provide it. We do not need telling, for hours on end, that vasectomy is different from conventional contraceptive methods because of its virtual irreversibility compared with other contraceptive devices which one simply stops using if one wants children. I grant that there is an important difference between the two. Nevertheless, with all its problems and risks, there are many more risks in life than this. We are strangely silent and cowardly in dealing with health hazards because of the enormous vested interests concerned. Parliament's hand is a palsied hand when it comes to separating health hazards from wide consumption of dangerous substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on this we have to take special care. Anything to do with sex arouses deep
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
emotions and feelings that people must not be allowed to do things which they may later regret. Many people regret a great many things in life, and we cannot provide against them all. If half as much counselling were done before people got married as they want when they are married, and when they want to stop having children, and so on, we might have a much happier society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But so long as we regard the right of procreation as one of the basic human rights with which no one must interfere—God-given and something everybody must be able to do for themselves without let or hindrance—so long as this is the public attitude, we shall not have a sensible approach to the state of marriage, but we shall have this kind of thinking, religious and prejudicial, brought into it when we come to matters of contraception and birth control, whether by vasectomy or by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will not retain in the Bill conditions which may well be imposed by local authorities in their judgment, either generally or in individual cases, but I do not think they should be stipulated in the Bill. I am against providing in the Bill stipulations which may be taken later at the judgment of Parliament on the general issue. We are not deciding the general issue of vasectomy. We are not in a position comparable with that on the Abortion Bill, where we were deciding what was lawful and what was unlawful in a matter of surgical treatment, irrespective of where or how it was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are dealing with an operation which is perfectly lawful in private practice and done in the National Health Service, and which we wish to allow to be provided by local authorities in cases where, in their judgment, it is just. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
is all we are doing. From what has been said in this Committee, one would think we were organising the sexual relationships of the whole community in a wide variety of circumstances. We are not doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always an honour for a Committee to have the presence of one of Her Majesty's Privy Councillors at its meetings. We have listened this morning, as we did last Wednesday, to a characteristically charming and restrained speech from the right hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. Houghton), in which he showed us the example of a Privy Councillor by refusing to give way to the hon. Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse), by being extremely rude to all members of the Committee who had spoken for over 10 minutes, and by refusing to give way to me. I consider that we ought all to be eternally grateful for the example that he has set to other Members of Parliament who have not been here as long as he has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendment No. 3, which aims to leave out "thirty years" and insert "sixty years", I had originally intended to insert "ninety-five", but I thought that that might be regarded as frivolous and therefore brought it down to a reasonable age, the sort of age below which it might be considered reasonable people should not have this operation—which has not even been proved to be legal yet—if they demanded it, had the consent of their wives, and were advised to have it for one reason or another.
