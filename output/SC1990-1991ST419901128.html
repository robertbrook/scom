	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (FEES FOR APPLICATIONS AND DEEMED APPLICATIONS) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS 1990</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Atkins)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Amendment) Regulations 1990.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the wish of the Committee that the draft Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations be considered at the same time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Aye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is singularly auspicious that we should meet in Committee Room 12 where yesterday a new Prime Minister was elected. That should go on the record, and I should perhaps declare an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main change introduced by the 1990 regulations is to provide for a general increase in the fees for planning applications. We have also taken the opportunity to make some very minor amendments to clarify the text of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two sets of regulations provide for an across-the-board increase in fees of around 20 per cent. if approved by this House and by another place, the new fees scale will come into operation next month. The overall effect of the new fees will be to maintain cost revovery at around its current level in England and Wales and to raise it to approaching the target rate in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present proposals, the basic units of fees will rise from £76 to £92, and from £38 to £46. A full application to build dwelling houses, for example, will be charged at £92 per dwelling house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the remaining changes we propose to make to the regulations are minor, and amount to little more than clarifying the text of the existing regulations in the light of our further experience of their operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.32 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is pleasing that the Tory leadership election is now out of the way and there can be a return to the business of governing the country. There has been little of that in the past four weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that these are minor amendments, but what is the basic priniciple behind the charges procedure? As I understand it, the fees at present should cover approximately 50 per cent. of the costs of planning
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
applications, and the figures given in the statutory instrument are a progression towards 100 per cent. charges for planning applications. Will the Minister clarify that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Department arrive at these figures? There has to be a system of figures to work to when considering the cost of processing planning applications. I assume that Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy returns are one factor to be considered here. But Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy returns do not include much of the work put in by local authority departments such as highway, environmental or legal departments. The Minister should say how the figures were arrived at. If Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy figures are used, are all factors considered? Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy does not include some items of expenditure in its questionnaire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In part II of schedule 1, paragraphs (11)(a) and (b) refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"The use of land for the disposal of refuse of waste or waste materials or for the deposit of material remaining after minerals have been extracted from land",</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the use of land for the storage of minerals in the open."</p></blockquote>
In considering the disposal of refuse and waste materials, we must remember, especially in the light of the new legislation, that local authorities often have to do a great deal of research. They frequently have to employ consultants to investigate the suitability of an area for waste—especially toxic waste—disposal. The £6,900 maximum sum for such an investigation is much too low, in view of the work that must be undertaken by local authorities and the new legislation. The Government wants to protect the environment, and we support the need for environmental protection in waste disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend will recognise that the problem presented to local authorities by toxic waste is acute in my constituency. He knows that the waste at Wath-upon-Dearne is matched by waste from the same consignment held near his constituency by British Rail. That material came to the area labelled as uncontaminated copper scrap. It should never have come and it should not remain. Ministers assured me that it would be removed by December 1989. You, Mr. Hill, will have heard me speak on the matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we shall not hear the honourable Gentleman make the same speech again. We must keep to the matter in hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hardy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that the burden on local authorities in such matters is enormous. The modest fee proposed by the Government would go only some way towards the costs incurred by local authorities and it is dwarfed by the size of the burden. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) in calling on the Minister to revise his attitude to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was my point. One incident involving toxic waste held in the areas of Rotherham district council and of Leeds city council has cost much more than the proposed fees. The planning application that should be submitted, if it has not been submitted, will cost much more to process that is suggested by the figures in this instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
We are dealing with minor changes, but we must consider the problem that faces local authorities in respect of the provision for waste disposal. Will the Minister consider the matter, particularly in relation to the point raised by my hon. Friend for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same can be said of mineral extraction. There will be an environmental assessment of an area before and after mineral extraction takes place, creating a great deal of time-consuming work for the local authority and its consultants. So the figure proposed for this type of planning application is much too low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 3 of the order, category 6 refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The enlargement, improvement or other alteration of existing dwellinghouses."</p></blockquote>
The fees for domestic applications have been increased to £46 and £92, a substantial increase which will affect people who cannot afford to buy a larger house but who want to improve or add on to their existing one. That is the reverse of what happens with waste disposal and mineral extraction, for which the fees charged are too low. People wanting to improve or extend their houses could be penalised. Blanket fees do not meet the total requirements of such planning applications. Furthermore, the increase for domestic planning applications is double the rate of inflation, which is unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Wandsworth borough council carried out an exercise 12 or 18 months ago to find out the full cost of planning applications, but its report never saw the light of day. If the Minister has any information about the results of that exercise, I should be pleased to hear it. I should also be grateful if the hon. Gentleman reconsidered the issue of complicated planning applications for mineral extraction and waste disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Metropolitan Authorities is asking its members for information on the cost of processing planning applications. Perhaps there should be a further review of the charges when the AMA receives that information. The Department's civil servants could perhaps work with the AMA to obtain the actual costs of processing planning aopplications. I understand that the returns are expected early in 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for factual information on how the figures have been calculated. I should also like to know why the increases for domestic planning applications are above the rate of inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I do not want to incur the Minister's wrath as I am seeing him on Thursday to try to extract some money from his Department for land reclamation in my area. I do not want to annoy or offend the hon. Gentleman but I should like to make one or two points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). The regulations keep the burden on the private citizen, while relieving the burden on businesses which may be exceedingly profitable and which may have schemes that are far more costly for the local authority to consider than any domestic planning application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must raise one matter with the Minister which may not be covered by these amendment regulations, but which could be relevant. If they are the Government's final change
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to planning applications, my anxiety may be completely unjustified. But, if not—and if my point is relevant—there is cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As several Committee members may know, some time ago I supported the case for the automatic right of parish councils, in a multi-tier local authority, to be informed of planning applications received by the higher authority. Parish councils in my constituency enjoy and exercise that right and express an opinion on planning applications that have been submitted for their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government are considering a change in the period of time during which a planning application must be considered. The Minister may agree that it is at least possible that, if that period is shortened, parish councils would not have time within the limits imposed by the Government to consider and comment on an application and inform the planning authority of the local view. If the Government are set on short-circuiting or reducing the time for local consideration, they may be doing a great injustice. I hope that I carry some Conservative Members with me on that—not especially partisan—matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The planning application system must continue to allow the parish or community council the right to consider applications for their areas and to give advice. I warn the Minister that, even if it is not dealt with in these regulations, it would be unwise and unhelpful to society generally if such a change were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton about the relatively low fees to be imposed in connection with profit-making activities. I do not say that profit is wrong; but if profit is to be secured by placing enormous disadvantage on a community, more questioning may be needed that the routine planning application process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Thursday, we shall tell the Minister that we have 1,000 acres in one large area of dereliction. We want part of that site to be developed; we want minerals extracted from part of that site to allow proper development; and that would help reclamation. The area has an asset for the community. However, not far away is an attractive green belt area. Suppose that someone sought planning approval for the extraction of minerals there. In my view, the local authority should try to prevent that; but, in any case, it should exercise great vigilance to ensure minimum damage. The cost of such an application to a local authority which seeks to protect its community could be enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider an arrangement to allow flexibility and to cover local authorities for the sometimes substantial work that they must undertake in the local interest? I look forward to the Minister's response to my hon. Friend's points, which I hope I have adequately supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member's for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy) who, with their usual courteous manners, have examined the regulations as I should have expected. In particular the hon. Member for Normanton speaks with authority on these matters, albeit from a different political standpoint. As he probably knows, the principle of the matter was examined in depth during discussion on the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980, when the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
principles towards which we are now working were laid out. If I do not now cover all the technical points that he raised, I shall do so in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle behind the draft statutory instrument is the requirement eventually to aim for a 100 per cent. coverage of costs. We cannot do that in the immediate future, but it is intended to achieve it within a few years. Now we are aiming for 52 per cent. The hon. Gentleman might be interested to know that the cost to local authorities of development control operations in 1989–90 is estimated at £160 million; the fee income at £83 million. That is in England; my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland might have the figures for Scotland. That represents nearly 52 per cent. of costs and it is generally accepted as fair because this is not meant to be a tax on development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where were the figures that the Under-Secretary gave the committee collected from? Are they from the local authority association or are they CIPFA figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities put submissions in. We cannot be exact about how they make their contributions. For example, some include the costs of highways and other matters; some do not. There is no unanimity on what the submissions should include. If the hon. Gentleman wishes me to examine in detail how the figures are calculated, I shall willingly do so and write to him in due course.

We intend to consult about simplifying the applications. The hon. Gentleman recognised their complexity. I was a planning chairman in a local authority some time ago, so I know that the problem with planning is that it is frightfully complicated.The applicant is often not certain what he is bidding for and how his application should be made. I have—and I am sure my hon. Friends have constituents who have come to me and said that they put in a submission, thinking that it would do one thing, only to discover that it will do somethng entirely different and cost them more than they expected.

I take the point about mineral extraction. There are bound to be differences throughout the country. This is a national fee scale, and unless we change the principle—which may or may not be right—there will be differences between local authorities. That might have to be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake to consider whether next year something should be done about minerals. I have recently assumed responsibility for the minerals requirement, and it is a controversial and difficult area. There is much interest in its costs and in related matters such as reclamation.

The hon. Member for Wentworth talked about parish councils. There is no intention to change the time scale for parish councils. Like him and many of hon. Friends my constituency has many parish councils [hon. Members "Hear, hear"]—and we have a high regard for their role in the front line of planning aplications. I have no intention of shortening the eight-week period. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.

I have covered all the points except the technical one, about which I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Under-Secretary's cooperation on the minerals point and I hope that we shall have a more realisitic approach to the charges for mineral extraction. Waste disposal and its planning implications are not his responisbility, but would he ask his colleague to examine the real cost of planning for waste disposal, particularly toxic waste disposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The hon. Gentleman knows that this is not my responsibility, but I shall certainly express the hon. Gentleman's concern to my hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and Countryside, whose responsibility I believe it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
