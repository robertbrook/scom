	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 243 in page 30, leave out lines 14 to 17 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) where the plea of guilty is tendered in writing, the accused shall be asked to complete a pro forma admitting or denying any previous convictions set out in that pro forma;".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment we shall take Government amendment No. 253.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that amendment No. 253 is just a matter of clarification. I see that we are not taking at the same time amendment No. 284, to leave out the new sub-paragraph (i).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 284 has not been selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a pity, Mr. Armstrong. I should like to have voted for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense amendment No. 243 is a probing amendment. I want to hear the Government's case in reference to previous convictions deemed to be admitted. I want to make sure that justice is done to the accused and that no problems arise. There are certain dangers inherent in sub-paragraph (i), because we are asking the accused to deny a conviction
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the writing by which that plea is tendered".</p></blockquote>
Surely it would have been much simpler for him, and make sure that we get accuracy, if attached to the plea there was a pro forma in which the convictions would be listed. He would then merely have to say "Nay" or "Yea" to each of them in turn, rather than in any complicated plea which he has to deal with. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1065</span>
an attempt to simplify matters and to help the accused to make sure that he gets it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those unfortunate situations in which I can see the strong administrative case for the change that the clause introduces. It is a matter of balancing the undoubted administrative convenience that would result against the possible confusion and injustice that could also result from this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows that in a large number of cases involving motoring offences under the Road Traffic Act there is a high percentage of pleas of guilty by letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Careless driving is an offence under section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1972. By and large people convicted under this section do not bother to give up a day's work to attend court, particularly if there is no danger of disqualification, which would almost certainly bring a personal appearance, and they plead guilty by letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often sat in court and heard a sheriff reading what is a quite explicit plea of guilty. But there is no admission of previous convictions attached to it. At that stage the sheriff says to the court, "I suppose that we had better continue it", rather grumpily. I am not sure whether it is because the sheriff is reluctant or because he cannot dispose of the matter until there has been a specific admission of the previous convictions. Can the Solicitor-General tell me?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it would be an enormous convenience for the court if it could railroad the matter through—that is perhaps a pejorative way to put it—if it could get the conveyor belt running smoothly and not have to hinder progress by going back to the accused, who no doubt in the vast majority of cases, when the matter is pointed out, will accept that the previous convictions are correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the reason for the clause, but. I do not shut my eyes to the dangers that could result. In our criminal courts, previous convictions are enormously important determinants of sentence, and a record of any substance will strongly influence the disposal of the court. Enormous statutory safeguards—advantages, in a sense—are built in for the first offender but, apart from those, when it actually comes to disposal, the most effective plea in mitigation is to say, "My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
Lord, my client has never been in trouble before. Here he is at the ripe old age of 21 without a blot on his escutcheon."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous unchallenged convictions on the record will affect the sentence. If in fact those convictions are false and have not been challenged merely because their significance was not appreciated by the accused, he may receive a much more severe sentence than would otherwise be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal of sympathy, therefore, with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). I wonder whether it is beyond the wit of man to design a pro forma not necessarily setting out all the previous convictions but if the accused is to plead guilty—I know that we go some way towards this by having a pro forma on the back of the complaint, which can be returned—specifically drawing his attention to the schedule of previous convictions, and enjoining him in forceful terms to tick it or to accept it, when sending in his plea. If that were done, and if it worked, it seems to me that we should not now need this power to allow the court to deem or assume that the previous convictions were in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Solicitor-General for Scotland accepts that it might be dangerous to give that power to the court. If we ensure that there is a proper pro forma and that people's attention is drawn to the fact that a generalised letter pleading guilty is not enough, and that they must either use the pro forma with its specific section asking "Do you admit the previous convictions?" or add a specific rider one way or the other to their plea in their letter, I think that we might be able to avoid the need for clause 39.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Armstrong. I have just realised the implications of the selection of amendments, and I am extremely disturbed that amendment No. 284 has not been selected. This paragraph introduces a totally new principle, one in which the accused is deemed to have previous convictions unless he expressly denies tham in writing. This is a tremendous change, which could have far-reaching consequences. It has precedents for other areas. It means that people who are unaware of the necessity to do this could face tremendous problems. They will not know about the problems of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
convictions which have time-elapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that this was one of the major issues of clause 39, and the amendment should have been called. I appreciate your difficulties with so many amendments, Mr. Armstrong, but without the amendment being debated I do not know how those who are strongly opposed to introducing this new principle can express their concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. It is not for me to advise hon. Members on how to deal with matters about which they feel strongly. The amendment as it is tabled would leave a bit of nonsense in the Bill. It is a question not of a substitution but of a straightforward deletion, and after careful consideration, the amendment has not been selected. The hon. Gentleman must make his own arrangements for dealing with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Armstrong. I think that the difficulty arises because, without an accompanying amendment for sub-paragraph (ii), which starts "in any other case", a kind of nonsense results. Surely this matter could have been dealt with by a further Government or Opposition amendment on Report. I was concerned that this sub-paragraph should go, and that we should leave it to the court to put the question as in sub-paragraph (ii). Therefore, I plead that the amendment be allowed to stand, as well as my own variation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the problem of having amendments which are not technically correct and which create drafting problems. I apologise for my lack of expertise in drawing up the amendments. I am one of the few non-lawyers on the Committee, which makes it particularly difficult. Notwithstanding that, I hope that we can discuss this principle and that the matter can be sorted out by the draftsmen at a later stage. As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) says it is a vital issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to deal with the Bill as it is and with the amendment as it is tabled. The amendment is not selected, but I shall be as generous as I can as regards debating the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1068</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbaim)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to advise the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) that the wit of man did conceive of a pro forma which was introduced in 1978 by act of adjournal. At present there goes with the complaint, schedule 4, "Notice of Previous Convictions":
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the event of your being convicted of the charge(s) in the Complaint it is intended to place before the Court the following previous conviction(s) applying to you."</p></blockquote>
They are then listed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Schedule 5 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<i>"Cross out whatever does not apply:</i>—</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<table class='table table-striped'>

	<tr>

	<td>PART 1</td>

	<td>I plead NOT GUILTY…</td>
</tr>

	<tr>

	<td>PART 2</td>

	<td>I plead GUILTY</td>
</tr>

	<tr>

	<td>
	<i>delete as appropriate</i></td>

	<td>I admit the previous convictions listed against me</td>
</tr>

	<tr>

	<td>I admit the previous convictions except (list those previous convictions not admitted)</td>
</tr>

	<tr>

	<td>I do not admit the previous convictions listed against me."</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

	<p>Therefore, what the amendment of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) seeks to provide already exists.</p>

	<p>The difficulty of the present situation is that, either by design or by default, many people when they send back their plea of guilty fail to admit, or deny, or qualify the list of previous convictions. The result is that it is mandatory on the court to have another diet and to serve a warrant on the person requiring him to be present at that diet. Occasionally the sheriff's clerk will write to the person and say "You did not fill up schedule 4 when you returned your plea of guilty. Would you now please do so?" A fortnight elapses during which there is no reply, so the person then has to be cited to attend. It is a cumbersome, expensive and wasteful process, and it is in a minute number of cases—practically never—that a challenge is made to any conviction.</p>

	<p>Therefore, as Thomson recommended, in summary cases there should be a mandatory assumption that the convictions are admitted. Of course there will still be the pro forma, so they still ought to be admitted. But in the absence of those admissions, a point raised by the hon. Member for Garscadden previously, there is a problem if one fails to admit one's convictions or fails to fill up the pro forma—for instance, if a person has two convictions in the past two years and eight months and can postpone his plea of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1069</span>
guilty for another four months, the totting-up procedure does not apply, because he has tholed his assize. If a person puts in a plea of guilty during the remaining period, he would have three convictions within three years and automatically he would have to be disqualified.</p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>That sort of abuse is perfectly practical and does occur. The Government take the view that this amendment, as overwhelmingly recommended by Thomson— paragraph 19.01—in summary cases, is sensible. Paragraph 19.04 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The overwhelming majority of those witnesses who submitted evidence to us on this proposal were in favour of the introduction of a rule on the lines indicated."—</p></blockquote>
that is, as appears in the subsection.
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would require to be made clear to the accused in the notice served on him that the previous convictions would be held to apply to him unless he expressly denied them. We agree with this view and we 
	<i>recommend</i> that a statutory rule should be introduced on the lines proposed."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>I understand the concern of the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). However, it is not as if the previous convictions are produced to the court and never served on the person who is pleading guilty. If he pleads guilty he must have been notified of them. He has an opportunity when filling in the plea of guilty to admit, deny or qualify them. That is part of the plea that he has to fill in.</p>

	<p>I understand the equitable concept. If the accused, who must have read the short pro forma while filling it in, does not admit or deny the convictions, he must surely be taken to have read it and not to have any comment. As the hon. Member for Garscadden said, if he has to be brought to the court to admit or deny the previous convictions it will probably mean a day off work. On the balance of equity more than on the grounds of expense and convenience I believe this to be an equitable change in the law.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Solicitor-General. The response is entirely a matter for those who are pressing the amendment. My view is that this is a matter of convenience. I do not feel very strongly about it. There is a degree of force in what the Solicitor-General has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are perhaps more mistakes in schedules of previous convictions than the hon. and learned Gentleman admits. To
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1070</span>
say that there are not many challenges is not quite the same. Many mistakes may go unchallenged. My experience of checking schedules is that if someone has 15 previous convictions, the fact that he may have been accredited—if that is the word—with a couple of extra breach of the peace convictions before the district court probably would not affect the court's disposal. However, I think that there are more mistakes than the Solicitor-General has conceded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administration of the SCRO system could be examined. It is a cause for some anxiety. If people really read through what was listed against them, there would be more challenges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note what the Solicitor-General said about the totting-up procedure. I must look at the law on that subject, as I am not sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman is entirely right. However, that can be left to his advisers. My understanding is that, whether the offence falls within the totting-up period is the relevant consideration. Perhaps that is a side issue, however.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the conviction, not the offence, that has to fall within the specified period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the position, perhaps the Government could think about correcting it. Abuses in this and many other areas should be prevented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, I accept that there is a pro forma. I referred to the fact that there was a pro forma on the matter of the complaint. I am not as familiar with it as perhaps I should be, as it was introduced in 1978, when I had largely retired from active practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens is entirely up to my hon. Friends, but I feel that we could end up making something of a mountain out of a molehill here. Perhaps we should listen to the Thomson recommendation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should explain—I think that I am right about this—that the present pro formas, as set out in the act of adjournal, are being simplified even more, so that there can be no excuse for misunderstanding by anyone who has to fill them in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing to me that I should find myself on all fours with an act
	<span class='label label-info column'>1071</span>
of adjournal. I am very pleased. It is a red-letter day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three things are to be said. First, I go along with my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) on the worry about deeming to admit any previous convictions. I agree that the balance is changing. Throughout the Bill on every clause the balance always changes in the same direction—towards the guilt of the accused. This is another minor example of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I accept that the pro forma exists. Further, we are now told that it will be simplified. That, of course, deals with the main part of my objection, and I shall seek to withdraw my amendment as the pro forma exists. But it was as well that we tabled the amendment, because at least we now know that it exists. It might be useful if, when the simplified version is available, we were given an opportunity to discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point is that we are left with the whole proposition of previous convictions deeming to be admitted, but that is a matter for the clause stand part debate. I shall seek to withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal briefly with three points. I am worried about the matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a
point of order, Mr. Armstrong. I think that the amendment has been withdrawn. Perhaps the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) can discuss the matter on clause stand part. May I move Government amendment No. 253?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 243 has not yet been withdrawn. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) indicated that he would seek to withdraw it. It is not withdrawn until the Committee has agreed to its withdrawal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The procedure is even more complicated than I realised. I do not mind when I make my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three points worried me. One was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—the question of mistakes. I have not had as much court experience as either my hon. Friend or the Solicitor-General for Scotland. All that I have seen are the forms appearing before me when I sat in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1072</span>
district court and the old burgh court benches. I have had experience of mistakes. If the sophisticated computer that is supposed to tell us that the Russians are about to attack America can make the mistakes that it has been making twice a week, we can expect these mistakes to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that I thought that that computer in America must be the same model as the Treasury use, judging by the way the economy is going at present. But I think that that point is slightly out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is on the question of convictions that are time-expired, or whatever is the appropriate phrase when they no longer count because their time has passed. Will the Solicitor-General for Scotland explain what happens to such cases if they do not appear on lists of previous convictions? I have seen convictions that occurred years and years ago still appearing on lists of convictions of some people at burgh and district courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third and important point that has not been made today is in the context of this amendment. I refer to the kind of forms that are produced. I have a reasonably high level of literacy—I put it no higher than that—but I find great difficulty in understanding exactly what is meant by the forms that appear before us in these judicial processes. They are most abstruse and very difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of people appearing before the court either have no ability to read—a surprisingly large proportion of our population is still unable to read—or have a very low level of reading ability. I ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland seriously to consider, when discussing the matter of pro formas when people are deemed to have previous convictions, ensuring that the communications that they receive are understandable, clear and simple. Otherwise, we are putting them in a difficult position. We are deeming them to have accepted convictions. We believe that they understand, when clearly they do not. They are bemused and befuddled by the complicated forms before them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 253, in page 30.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1073</span>
line 14, after "(i)", insert "in a case". —[
	<i>The Solicitor-General for Scotland.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that we had a judge in our ranks. He expressed the same anxieties, and I notice that the Glasgow Bar Association is also concerned about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It believes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the accused should not be deemed to admit any previous convictions unless he states admission of these previous convictions."</p></blockquote>
This ties up with the continual drift of the Bill towards a presumption of guilt. I should prefer to revert to section 357 of the 1975 Act, and leave it in that form, rather than bringing in presumption of guilt, as here. I shall therefore oppose the amended clause until I hear better reasons for supporting it than merely administrative convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only one brief point, because my hon. Friends have made the position very clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be some difference between the explanatory memorandum and the clause. I accept that one should read the Bill, but many who skim through such a Bill read only the explanatory memorandum, as the best way of finding out roughly what the Bill contains. The explanatory memorandum does not make clear that this provision is purely for those who are pleading guilty in writing. It leaves it open to the assumption that it is about other things as well. The Solicitor-General should consider making the explanatory memorandum more explicit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that the explanatory memorandum disappears when the Bill becomes an Act, so nobody will be confused by that. The clause is perfectly clear.

With the present pro forma it is clear that, whatever the level of literacy, one must have read the instruction that one could plead guilty by letter if one wanted to. Otherwise, one would not have pleaded guilty by letter. That is part of the pro forma. There could be nothing simpler than:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION ON PASSING SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT OR DETENTION ON PERSON NOT LEGALLY REPRESENTED</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause, which should not pass without comment and without one or two questions being asked of the Solicitor-General, if only for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I am anxious to find out what would be the position of an accused person conducting his or her own defence. Both definitions contained in clause 40 are quite clear, particularly that of "legally represented", which means:
	<br><blockquote><p>"represented by counsel or a solicitor at some stage after the accused is found guilty and before he is dealt with as referred to in subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the possibility of someone conducting his or her own defence has not escaped the attention of the Solicitor-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
unfairness to any person who wishes to plead guilty and upon whom there has been served a list of previous convictions and a stern invitation to comment on them. I do not see that in the vast number of summary cases that go through that can have any effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act dealing with previous convictions does not apply for the purposes of court appearances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 4.</p>

	<p>General. I am anxious to find out how that person would stand under the terms of clause 40.</p>

	<p>There is also the question of the suspended sentence policy as operated in England. It was proposed in the Labour Government's Bill in the last Parliament but has been dropped from this legislation. There is no proposal in this Bill to introduce a suspended sentence in the courts in Scotland, yet in clause 40—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. Clause 40(2)(
	<i>a</i>) excludes suspended sentences in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point to which I was coming, namely, that the suspended sentence in England would be excluded in consideration by the court in Scotland but, I take it, only if that suspended sentence had not taken effect under section 23 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts Act 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background. My real point is the position of two accused people, one being considered for his first custodial sentence and the other also possibly being considered for a first custodial sentence but having already been sentenced to imprison-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1076</span>
ment in England or Wales, though that sentence had been suspended for the simple reason that there was never a need to put it into effect. Although the Solicitor-General says that the suspended sentence will be disregarded, I am anxious to find out how the court will weigh the past record of both accused who are before the court in Scotland, presumably on a first custodial sentence in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to the detention of young offenders in Scotland. Subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) says that we should
	<br><blockquote><p>"construe detention as meaning— in relation to Scotland, detention in a young offenders institution or detention centre."</p></blockquote>
Hitherto these have been separate institutions where different treatment has been administered. We are all aware that the detention centre at Glenochil provides a stricter and harsher regime than that at the young offenders institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does clause 40 change the designation of the young offenders institutions in Scotland? There is one at Dumfries, but I see that the Solicitor-General agrees that the one in Edinburgh has closed down—which is why Glenochil was opened. But is the designation of the young offenders institution changed by clause 40, and does it create detention centres out of young offenders institutions? If that is the case I should strongly object to the change being made in such a clause as clause 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Solicitor-General will be able to give specific answers to all my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general terms this is a clause which most Opposition Members welcome, in that it attempts to take out of prisons people who perhaps should never have been there, and should not be there, and to reduce the prison population generally. That can only be a good result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But one or two points cause me anxiety. Perhaps they arise from the way in which the clause is worded. First, can I assume that paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) of subsection (1) apply only to a person who pled not guilty? Subsection (1) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>
"unless the accused either—

	<ol>

	<li>applied for legal aid… or</li>

	<li>having been informed of his right to apply for legal aid, and having had the opportunity, failed to do so."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
If an offender had pled guilty, would he not have had the services of the duty solicitor at all stages? If that is the case, it puts a slightly unfair burden on the person
	<span class='label label-info column'>1077</span>
who has pled not guilty to an offence as opposed to the person who has pled guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the problem of the relationship between subsection (1)(
	<i>a</i>) and subsection (4). The second part of subsection (4) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>" 'legally represented' means represented by counsel or a solicitor at some stage after the accused is found guilty and before he is dealt with as referred to in subsection (1) above."</p></blockquote>
To my mind that creates a problem if it relates to applying for legal aid, and the application were refused on the ground that the applicant was not financially eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I am open to correction by legal experts, but I think that I am right in saying that a court may deny legal aid to an accused, irrespective of means, on the grounds that it is not in the interests of justice. It would be possible for the court or a judge to have denied legal aid to a person for his defence during the trial and then—following the decision that the person was guilty and before sentencing him—to give him legal aid in order to be able to imprison him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is what the clause intends—I do not think that it is the great protection that it was intended to be—a person may be denied a defence during his trial and, therefore, may not be in a position to defend himself properly. If he is found guilty and the judge decides that he wants to put him in prison, the only way to do that if he is a first offender is to give him legal aid, which allows the judge to sentence him to imprisonment. That does not seem right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause appears to imply that legal representation for first offenders is more important than for those who have offended before. It is merely an implication, but by linking legal representation and the application of legal aid in this way—as has not, I believe, happened before—there is a suggestion that legal representation is more important for a person appearing in court for the first time than for someone who has appeared previously. We should not allow that implication to stand. I hope that the Solicitor-General will deny that that is so and state that a person who is before a court is entitled to legal representation and legal aid under all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the clause generally, but certain parts give cause for concern. I hope that the Solicitor-General will be able to answer our queries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1078</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) said, this is an interesting and quite important provision. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that it is important that we understand exactly what is involved and how the Solicitor-General envisages it working. I wish to raise with him a number of practical nuts-and-bolts questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the intention is that the court should not pass a sentence of imprisonment on an accused who is not legally represented in that court and who has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment or detention. This harks back to keeping accurate records of previous convictions, because disputes can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am curious about the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"nor impose imprisonment … in respect of … failure to pay a fine".</p></blockquote>
I assume that that means that at the means courts there is no legal representation. However, ultimate failure to pay a fine will bring the possibility of imprisonment. Accordingly, there will have to be legal representation if there has not been a previous conviction which involved imprisonment. That probably means that there will be certain practical difficulties about extending legal aid cover—for example, the duty solicitor—to these processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart. If an application for legal aid has been refused on the ground that the accused was not financially eligible, as set out in subsection (1)(
	<i>a</i>), I assume that the exclusion of the refusal on the ground that it is not in the interests of justice is specific and deliberate. If a person is denied legal aid because it is not in the interests of justice, in which event custodial sentences are likely to loom high in the sheriff's mind, is there a possibility that such sentences will be imposed only if legal representation is available?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not an unimportant question. The Solicitor-General will remember that he urged—I was going to say "incited", but that is perhaps unfair—sheriffs that in certain circumstances they should withdraw legal aid that had been granted on the ground that its granting was not in the interests of justice. That was in connection with intermediate diets under clause 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the specific advantages of the intermediate diet being argued by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1079</span>
Solicitor-General was that if the good sheriff came to the conclusion, as a result of his investigations under clause 15, that there was insufficient preparation by the defence, perhaps through the fault of the client—that is, through his failure to consult the solicitor timeously—legal aid should be withdrawn. Legal representation would have been available, but it would have been prior to the stage at which the accused was found guilty, as was perceptively pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart. Therefore, he is presumably a person who had not been legally represented in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there has been no previous conviction, I presume that there will have to be a renewal of legal aid, or does the Solicitor-General assume that that will be done by whistling up the duty agent? I take it that that is seen only in terms of a quick consultation, a properly presented plea in mitigation and nothing more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to know whether there will be a specific grant of legal aid with an element of 
	<i>delectus personnae</i>—"I want Mr. So-and-So of such and such a Bar"—or whether the duty legal aid solicitor will be made available by the court. The latter course would have some implications for the duty aid solicitor, because he would possibly have to be present in court for a much longer part of the week than at present. If so, that calls in question the issue of his remuneration, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Solicitor-General will tell us how the duty solicitor will be remunerated and whether normal rates will be paid for waiting time. In the larger cities it will not be possible easily or quickly to summon the duty solicitor from his office, and he will have to remain available in the court building for the duration of the court's sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart that there might be difficulties if a person appeared without legal representation and legitimately changed his plea at the last moment. I know that is something on which the Solicitor-General has strong feelings. Presumably at that stage we shall get into the difficulties to which I have referred. I want to know whether a full legal aid certificate will be specifically granted or whether the duty solicitor will be relied upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Solicitor-General should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0646">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1080</span>
consider the basis on which legal aid is presently granted in the courts. The clause makes the welcome point that representation is extremely important, especially where a custodial sentence is a possibility. The exception that will permit the sheriff to go ahead and sentence without the accused having legal representation where there has been a refusal on the ground of financial eligibility is of some concern to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that practice varies between courts—from district court to sheriff court and from sheriff court to sheriff court. I am not as in touch with some matters as I once was. Inflation has possibly changed the circumstances. A few years ago, when I was operating in the courts with which I was familiar, a single man living at home with an income of about £22 or £24 a week would never be granted legal aid by some sheriffs, on the ground that he was not financially eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inflation has presumably altered that threshold, but I suspect that there are still courts where a single person earning £26 or £28 a week will not be granted legal aid on the ground that there are four months before the trial, and saving at the rate of £8 a week should produce enough to meet the costs. That can operate extremely unfairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be particularly unfortunate if subsection (1)(
	<i>a</i>) meant that a person who had not been able to get legal representation—it is sometimes almost impracticable—found that he did not even have the safeguard of the clause. In other words, he would be sentenced without the benefit of legal advice, because the sheriff would be able to say "We do not need to bother about that, because he was refused legal aid on financial grounds."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Solicitor-General cannot do anything immediately, but I hope that he will at least give me some assurances that he will consider legal aid practice, especially at some of the courts where legal aid is refused to unmarried men on a low income. The result of that would be that accused persons, if they found themselves in jeopardy of a gaol sentence, would not be covered by the sensible safeguards of clause 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know a little more about how the system will be operated and we want to make sure that there will be a reasonably total encompassing of those whom I believe the clause is genuinely meant to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can answer all the points that have been raised. I do not know whether the latter observations of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) represent a special pleading as a single man, but I undertake to examine the practice in the various courts when defining and dealing with the concept of financial ability. That is an important issue and perhaps I may be allowed to write to the hon. Gentleman about it on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful, and I am grateful to the Solicitor-General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. and learned Gentleman considers the matter and writes to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), will he consider the weight given by sheriffs, when considering legal aid applications, to their estimate of the length of the trial? There is the well-publicised case of a few years ago, when a sheriff estimated that a trial would last a given number of weeks and refused legal aid on the basis that within that time the person would be able to meet his own expenses. But, lo and behold, the trial lasted much longer and legal aid had not been made available. Therefore, I shall be grateful if the Solicitor-General will consider that point as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, but that would not apply in this instance, because sentencing would not last very long. However, I undertake to consider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of "in the interests of justice", while legal aid may be refused in the interests of justice for the purposes of the trial, legal aid cannot be refused in the interests of justice. In other words, it cannot be refused for any reason except as set out in the statute, namely, financial eligibility. There is no difficulty about that from the point of view of the accused person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Garscadden asked me about the means court. As clause 40 says, there shall be no sentence of imprisonment or detention
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of failure to pay a fine, on an accused who is not legally represented in that court and has not been previously sentenced to imprisonment".</p></blockquote>
It is our hope that people do not automatically fall through the slot into prison when they have failed to pay a fine.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1082</span>
Therefore, in those circumstances they would be legally represented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of real importance in practical terms. The means courts are a fairly common feature of many sheriff courts. What exactly is envisaged here? As the Solicitor-General knows, when a fine is imposed with a condition of instalment payments and the convicted person pays a couple of instalments and then stops paying, ultimately the system will catch up with him and he will be brought to the means court. If, when he comes to the means court he says "My mummy was ill and I was off work", or makes this, that or another excuse, the sheriff may say "I shall take that into consideration but you have to pay. I shall reduce the instalments from £5 a week to £2 a week and will impose an alternative of 90 days." In a sense, that is not sentencing the person to a term of imprisonment, because if he pays that £2 a week he will not go to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in another sense that is sentencing him to imprisonment, because if he does not pay that £2 a week the 90 days automatically comes into effect. Therefore, the phrase in clause 40
	<br><blockquote><p>"A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment … in respect of failure to pay a fine"</p></blockquote>
seems almost meaningless, unless one is saying that there must be legal representation in circumstances where an alternative prison sentence is being imposed. I hope that the Solicitor-General follows me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Gentleman absolutely. However, whenever any fine is imposed there is by statute, theoretically, an alternative of prison. When a person goes to the means court, the court is saying, theoretically, "Give a good reason why the alternative should not take effect." Therefore, that is the situation in which he would be legally represented. The point of the means court is to try to prevent the automatic arrest and imprisonment provisions applying if there is an equitable explanation. That is why the means court was introduced. Before that one went along and if one saw the person one said "Oh, that person hasn't paid the fine, I remember his name", and he was arrested and taken to Barlinnie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is clear, and I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1083</span>
am perhaps lumbering along in the rear on this point, but I, at least, wish to understand. Is the Solicitor-General for Scotland saying that the sheriff, sitting on the bench in a means court, would be able to impose new instalments, with the specific alternative on payment failure, without legal representation, but that if, for rather unusual reasons, the sheriff did not wish to give a second chance to someone, because he thought that his failure to pay had been such condign cheek, and thought that that person should be removed forthwith, he would have to arrange for legal representation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly so. The hon. Member for Gars-cadden has it right. There is a Russian proverb which says that even the longest rivers wind their way to the sea. No doubt the hon. Member for Garscadden is now at sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Cathcart. First, he raised a point which gives rise to doubt under the definition of legally represented, because the clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after the accused is found guilty".</p></blockquote>
May I look at that again to see whether we should not add the words "or pleads guilty", because it could be exclusive, although I do not think that it is. However, I undertake to look at that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of first offenders being given a superior right to others. Here we are not dealing with first offenders. We are dealing with people who, whether first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth or tenth offenders, have never been to prison. Therefore we are talking about first custodial risks, and I do not think that first offenders have preference. Where the first offender would be at risk of imprisonment there are statutory provisions already, and we shall come to others which protect first offenders in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point made by the hon. Gentleman was about legal aid, namely, that the sheriff could make prison a possibility by granting him legal aid. Of course that is so. But that is standing the matter on its head. The sheriff cannot send him to prison without granting him legal aid, so that a plea, probably in mitigation, can be made. But to say that the sheriff says to himself, "Ah, I will give thee the gift of legal aid because I also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1084</span>
wish to give thee the gift of prison," is artificial. Clearly, the sheriff cannot imprison unless legal representation has been offered, made available and either accepted or refused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As that last paragraph reads, it is possible that a person might not be legally represented at any stage up to the time that he had been found guilty, and then be legally represented by the granting of legal aid, and as a result of that representation at that stage be sent to prison. Am I right about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is right. Let me give three examples. First, if a person pleads guilty, he is probably not legally represented up to that stage, but he must be offered legal representation thereafter, before a sentence of imprisonment can be considered. Secondly, the sheriff may say "Do you have a solicitor?" and the person may say "Na". The sheriff may say "Do you want a solicitor?" and the reply may be "Na". The trial goes on. The person is found guilty. The sheriff says "I may have to sentence you to imprisonment because you have an extremely bad record and have been lucky in the past—and you may be lucky in the future, once the hon. Member for Garscadden has been summoned to speak on your behalf." So the person would then be legally represented and the sheriff would consider the plea in mitigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very rare for any legal representative to say "I plead with your Lordship that it is in the interests of this man that he should go to prison." For one reason or another I have occasionally had to say that, though it sounds a little odd. The reason might be to keep him out of harm's way, or that he is an incurable drunk, or to keep him out of Carstairs. But such occasions are rare, and in almost all circumstances the legal representative will be urging the court on cause shown why the man should not be imprisoned for the first time. That is the safeguard introduced in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the points raised by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing). First, the clause does not change the status, or equate the status, of the young offenders institution and the detention centre. It is not an 
	<i>ejusdem generis</i> clause. Simply, those are the only
	<span class='label label-info column'>1085</span>
alternatives of detention available in Scotland and the available forms of detention in England and Wales. So there is no risk about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a suspended sentence is excluded specifically if it is not served. What the position would be in reverse I am not quite sure. If the person on a suspended sentence in England is sentenced in Scotland to, let us say, a fine of £500 for assaulting a policeman, I presume that the court in England could then dis-suspend the sentence; but that court's reaction to a conviction or a plea of guilty during the suspension of a sentence is not a matter for the law of Scotland, or for us. But a sentence of imprisonment that has not been served—a prospective sentence of imprisonment—cannot be taken into account in this matter. The person who has been sentenced in England and Wales to a suspended sentence and has served no part of that sentence in prison shall not in any circumstances be deemed to have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth raised the question of someone who conducts his own defence. People quite often elect to do so, for a variety of reasons. They may think that they can tell their story better out of their own mouth than through the mouth of somebody else. That is quite common. Certainly if one's story is as complicated as that of the late Mr. Peter Thomas Anthony Manuel one might feel that it would be much easier to tell it oneself rather than to get someone to take it from one by question and answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of the accused conducting his own defence and being found guilty, or pleading guilty at any point, the clause comes back into effect and if a period of imprisonment is in consideration he must be offered the opportunity of legal aid so that he may be represented before sentence. Whether he defends himself or not, he must then be offered the opportunity of representation. Whether he is represented by the duty solicitor or by any other solicitor will, I imagine, be a matter of equity and convenience in each court on each occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to anticipate the effect on duty solicitors. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden must be happy that the income of those representing people in Glasgow sheriff court and district court will inevitably be increased by these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1086</span>
proposals. I do not know whether the duty solicitor's job will become impossible, and I do not know how the duty solicitor is remunerated. If the hon. Gentleman really wants me to investigate the matter, I will do so, but I am sure that the Law Society will have very strong protective feelings for the duty solicitor, and I do not think that the Committee need concern itself with his fate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION ON PASSING SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT ON PERSON NOT PREVIOUSLY SO DEALT WITH</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 298, in page 31, line 19, leave out from "age" to "unless" in line 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one for trying to make progress in the Committee, Mr. Armstrong, and my view is that it would be convenient to take amendments Nos. 298 and 299 together. It was my hope that they would be grouped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is acceptable to the Committee, with this we shall take amendment No. 299, in page 31, line 22, leave out from "and" to "the" in line 24 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"before any sentence of imprisonment shall be imposed".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause enters an area which is perhaps of more general interest to the Committee than some of the highly technical and legal points that we have been discussing, and will have a considerable impact on the workload of social work departments in Scotland. The amendments are designed to strive for the ideal situation—although I may be convinced by the debates that idealism is impractical and not press them to a Division—and they will also give an opportunity to consider what the effect of the halfway house recommended in the clause will be on the resource crisis, which any one of us who is in daily contact with the social work departments knows to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will understand the effect of clause 41, namely, that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment on a person of or over, twenty-one years of age who has not been previously sentenced to imprisonment or detention by a court in any part of the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1087</span>
The effect of that, as I understand it, is that anyone who is a first offender in the sense of not having been previously sentenced to imprisonment cannot be sentenced to imprisonment over the age of 21 until a social inquiry report has been made available to the court. This puts offenders on the same footing as offenders under 21, who presently have to be the subject of court reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will remember, this was not the recommendation of Lord Thomson, not in the sense that his committee would necessarily disagree with the clause, but it argued strongly that it did not go far enough. The relevant and interesting paragraphs are Nos. 55.06 and 55.07 of the committee's report which record the fact that there were a number of, in its view, misguided attempts to suggest that we should cut down the number of reports that have to be provided, on the basis that social work departments were not in a position to provide them or to get on with other work. The committee said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is true that the social work service is under considerable pressure at the present time and this is no doubt in part due to the transition from the old to the new arrangements. It seems to us that the proposal to reduce the number of background reports required by the courts stems from a desire to relieve the immediate pressure on the social work departments rather than from a consideration of what is best in the long run. While we understand and sympathise with the immediate objectives of the proposal we do not think that the answer lies in altering procedure sound in principle for the sake of expediency—as we suggest this proposal does—but rather in improving the social work services.?"</p></blockquote>
The committee went on specifically to recommend
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the present requirement for background reports should be extended to include all cases in which a person is charged upon indictment and all summary cases where the sentencing judge is contemplating a custodial sentence. The date for implementing these proposals should be deferred until such time as the resources of the social work departments are adequate".</p></blockquote>
The effect of amendments Nos. 298 and 299 is to go down the road fully with the Thomson committee. They take out the qualification
	<br><blockquote><p>"who has not been previously sentenced to imprisonment or detention by a court in any part of the United Kingdom"</p></blockquote>
and merely leave the kernel of clause 41 as
	<br><blockquote><p>"A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment on a person of or over twenty-one years of age unless the court considers that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1088</span>
The clause then goes'on to argue'that
	<br><blockquote><p>"before any sentence of imprisonment shall be imposed"</p></blockquote>
a social report shall be obtained. In other words, a sheriff is sitting on the bench with a convicted person before him. It comes into his mind that inevitably he will have to consider the possibility of imprisonment. He should call for a social inquiry report in all cases, even where there is no previous sentence of imprisonment—not limited as it presently appears in clause 41.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although that is recommended by Lord Thomson—a respectable basis for agurment—I am aware that it will impose a considerable additional burden on social work departments. It is fair to ask, at this stage, whether the Government have any estimates of what will be imposed by clause 41 as it presently stands. If they have been making estimates, can they give some calculation of the effect of the implementation of amendments Nos. 298 and 299?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have been reading the various briefings, usefully provided, recall that the British Association of Social Workers' Scottish committee produced some interesting figures when it said that in 1976 2,090 adult first offenders were sent to prison. First offenders is not necessarily the same category as that envisaged in clause 41. It is not a matter of being a first offender. One could have offended before, but as long as there was no custodial sentence imposed before, one would not necessarily have to call for a report. It would be interesting to have an update of that figure of 2,090, which I am sure will be available to the Solicitor-General. Perhaps he could sophisticate the figure a little by trying to tailor it to the impact of clause 41.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also be grateful if he could go a little further and try to estimate what the impact would be if my amendments were adopted. No one should go to prison without a social inquiry report being obtained and the court having the fullest possible information about the accused and his circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will appreciate—I do not think that there will be any argument about this—there is a fairly broad welcome from the Opposition Benches for moves in this direction. Anyone who has been involved in the courts or in social work departments will appreciate that the social inquiry report is an extremely valuable sentencing aid to the court. Sometimes one can become a little cynical about it. As a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1089</span>
solicitor making a plea in mitigation, I know that I sometimes regard it as a rather better prepared background to my plea in mitigation than anything else. But the vast majority of the reports are objective. They are skilfully done and provide a great deal of useful information. They ought to be available in any circumstance when we are taking the serious step of depriving a man of his liberty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that there is no one in the Committee who takes the rather cynical view, that one used to hear in attacks on the social work profession, that the people involved were too inexperienced and too prejudiced in favour of the accused. I hope that it shows how far in the past it is, but it used to be expressed as mini-skirted little girls running around and being taken for a ride by hardened criminals, and giving the court a lot of totally unrealistic advice and information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that that is the position. I think that most social workers do an extremely good job and it is important that the court should have the benefit of their advice, while recognising that always the final decision remains with the sentencing judge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that I wish to press the amendment and go that bit further than clause 41 by taking in the Thomson recommendation in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is the amendment generally welcomed by Opposition Members but there is a recognition among most of the social workers who have written to us that it is of positive value to supply social work reports in the way that I have described, either on the basis of clause 41 or, in the ideal world, to go along the road what is made out in amendments Nos. 298 and 299.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1975 Lord Thomson said that social work departments were under great pressure. However, that optimistic man then worked from the assumption that that pressure arose from transitional difficulties following the introduction of the generic social worker and the integrated social work department. Unfortunately, that pressure is still very much with us. As we push forward the frontiers of service, we recognise that there is an incredible unmet need in the world of social work. Unmet need is a cliche of the legal profession. Everyone worries that we do not supply sufficient legal services. But if there is an unmet need there, there is an infinitely greater unmet need in the world of social work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1090</span>
There are an enormous number of statutory demands on social work departments to produce court reports and reports for children's panels. Having been a reporter in what I believe was the second biggest reporters' department in Scotland, I know what an enormous burden I placed upon the social workers in Lanarkshire. There is a fear that soon there may be no opportunity to do remedial casework, no opportunity for any kind of preventive social work. Social workers could become mere suppliers of reports to courts for sentencing purposes, and be squeezed out of the broader, more constructive role that they should be fulfilling in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7.1 of the BASW report to which I referred says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By opening up a new area of demand this clause may effectively nullify the advances towards specialisation being made by some departments and the time spent on preparing reports may prevent any increase in the time available for prevention and intervention in the personal and family problems of offenders."</p></blockquote>
I cannot, of course, go down this road now, but I might quarrel with BASW about the level of specialisation and how it should be managed, although I agree that there must be a certain degree of weighting of caseloads within departments. However, the second part of the sentence expresses exactly the worry that I have been airing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people have pointed out that there is now considerable doubt about the use of probation. Probation is becoming a less popular option with sheriffs. That reflects the fact that social work departments are less able to carry out the intensive one-to-one casework that successful probation demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the report of the director of social work in the Lothian region, Mr. R. W. Kent, has been circulated to members of the Committee. Paragraph 4.2.4 of that report says that Mr. Kent is worried that the admirable motivation of the clause may come to nought because the point and validity of reports
	<br><blockquote><p>"becomes lost if all they catalogue is the inability to afford courts any alternatives to custody: in that event they become merely passports to prison instead of arrows showing potential diversions".</p></blockquote>
Mr. Kent has a turn of phrase which is not mine. None the less, he makes the point clearly. There is a major crisis over resources in social work departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1091</span>
Recommendation No. 3 of NAPO's memorandum says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless further resources are provided for social work departments, social workers will spend more time writing reports and will be less likely to be able to offer probation as an alternative to the courts".</p></blockquote>
A further quotation from the BASW report sums up the reaction to the clause. Paragraph 7.5 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Again, the Bill does not provide for, or even mention, the extra costs falling on local authority social work departments and without additional resources the purpose of this clause will not be achieved.”</p></blockquote>
The clause is well intentioned, and we welcome it. However, it does not go as far as Thomson wanted, and Thomson was right in wanting to go further. The amendments would achieve that further journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to press the amendments. However, given the present financial climate, I recognise that they may be difficult to implement. I am not unreasonable. I know that the Solicitor-General will tell me that if I look at the recommended limits under the rate support grant I shall find that there is an increase of about 2 per cent. on the social work budget. But in my area and there is no doubt that social work departments are under an increasing strain as more and more demands are being made on their time and resources. I fear that even implementing clause 41 as it stands may turn out to be an empty gesture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking for specific and proper assurances from the Solicitor-General for Scotland and his colleagues. It is unfortunate that the Under-Secretary of State is perhaps more involved mainstream in political decision making than is the Solicitor-General for Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the expressions of horror but I fear that that is the position. Perhaps the Solicitor-General is not the best person to give those assurances, but assurances there ought to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regard my amendments in terms of what is said to me during the course of this debate. If we can have some sort of assurances that resources will be made available, I think that we should push ahead with amendments Nos. 298 and 299. I would expect the Government to accept that they are desirable ends. If we receive no assurances at all, I would not pursue the amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1092</span>
ments, but would regard it as another example of the Government falling far short of what ought to be provided in regard to adequate social services. That is especially sad in an area where they have always maintained that they have a peculiar sensitivity and a special commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we receive no assurances, I shall even feel extremely cynical about clause 41—the halfway house as it presently is—because without some positive help, a diversion of resources to social work departments, the understandable reservations and caveats about the clause which I have quoted from various professional organisations will be well-founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I look forward to a debate on the role of social work departments, but especially to some hard information from the Solicitor-General for Scotland about how he will expand the social work effort to take up the strain that the new provision will impose upon them. I would like evidence in figures that there has been real work, real consultation, about its impact. I would like to know what the new case load will be. I would like to know how many court reports are presently done and what percentage the expected increase will be of the total. I would like some account of the many consultations that have taken place between the Solicitor-General for Scotland and his colleagues and those who will have the job of implementing the new policy on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those comparatively brief introductory remarks, I shall sit down to allow other hon. Members to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Armstrong. I intended to intervene earlier when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden rose. I am not clear whether you are taking amendments Nos. 298 and 299 with amendments Nos. 285 and 286.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will be taken separately. We are taking at the moment amendments Nos. 298 and 299 together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. When I promise to be brief, I am brief. I fully approve of the intention of the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). They are absolutely right and are in line with the Thomson report in this matter. It seems
	<span class='label label-info column'>1093</span>
to me that in many cases people who have been in and out of prison all their lives probably need a social report from a social worker more than do those who are first offenders. There must be an attempt—it is often only the social work department which can make that attempt—to stop this constant pattern of being in and out of prison and to try to break that pattern by another form of treatment. But unless there is a social work report, that is not possible, and, therefore, I go along with what my hon. Friend has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about resources I leave until we come to the later amendments tabled by my hon. Friends and myself in relation to the social work. In the phrase we are attempting to remove, which is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"who has not been previously sentenced to imprisonment or detention by a court in any part of the United Kingdom"</p></blockquote>
Will the caveat in clause 40, in relation to suspended sentences in parts of the United Kingdom other than Scotland, apply?—in other words, must the sentence of imprisonment have actually been served rather than merely passed? As the clause reads at the moment, it would be a sentence. If the person had been sentenced to a suspended sentence in England and was then found guilty of an offence in Scotland, he would not be covered. He could be sentenced to imprisonment without any social worker's report. I should be grateful if the Solicitor-General would look at that point and say whether suspended sentences elsewhere are included or whether it is, simply as it reads, a sentence. A suspended sentence is a sentence of imprisonment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I
think I can assist the hon. Gentleman. If he looks at 41(3) he will see that the provisions of clause 40 apply for the purposes of this clause also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. I should have read one stage further, or at least looked back. That was the point that I was worried about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come to the major debate about the social work aspect later in discussing other amendments. I fully support the purpose of my hon. Friend's amendment. I hope that unless we get very clear assurances from the Solicitor-General he will press these amendments, because they seem to me to be very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1094</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Hogg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too fully support the amendments which stand in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I agree that the half-way house, as he described clause 41, is also desirable. However, he is a reasonable man, and he has said so to the Committee. He has said that he will not press his amendments if he obtains assurances from the Solicitor-General. That is a matter for him, but there is always a case for arguing that we should set ideal standards and see what can be done to achieve them. I support his amendments because they go that bit further, and move towards the evidence that was submitted to the Thomson committee. Although the Thomson committee made firm recommendations in paragraphs 55.06 and 55.07, it also drew attention in paragraph 55.03 to the evidence that it received from the directors of social work, the British Association of Social Workers, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, and some High Court judges. The evidence was that ideally background reports should be provided in all cases punishable with imprisonment coming before the courts. That, as I understand it, is what my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden seeks to achieve. I think that that is a proper objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the Opposition is to create the best possible conditions for the rehabilitation of offenders. We do not attempt to disguise the fact that there are in our society serious difficulties, and a high rate of crime and violence that we should like to see eradicated. Where we differ from Conservative Members is in what we see as the causes of that problem and how we tackle those who fall foul of the problems and become offenders. We are attempting to achieve the best possible conditions for rehabilitation. That is why I think that background reports in all cases, which would give information on medical and psychological conditions, would form the best basis for making a decision and arriving at correct sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, much of the criticism that is directed at the courts today is founded on the assertion that there is insufficient information on which to make decisions concerning individual offenders and the best treatment for them. That contrasts with the children's panels, to which my hon. Friend the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>1095</span>
for Garscadden referred. There is a great deal of detailed information in those cases, founded on the one-to-one relationship between the social worker and the child. We and the panel are able to act on the best possible information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden referred to his experience as a children's reporter at Lanarkshire and Rutherglen, perhaps he is a little modest. In fact, when he was there, it was said that the information before the panel was at a very high standard and it was therefore possible to make good decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Government's general intention in regard to clause 41, but I should like them to go further. I therefore support the amendments that seek to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I may say something about social work without incurring the wrath of Conservative Members, who are getting a little weary of my support for social workers. I should like to make a serious point about social work departments. When I was employed by the National and Local Government Officers' Association, I had to travel around Scotland and visit the social work departments in most of our main cities and large towns. They are woefully understaffed. The resources are not available and the physical environment in which they are expected to discharge their duties is not adequate for the task before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, we should write the statute in a way that sets the ideal and that makes the demand on social work departments. But equally the House and the Government have a responsibility to ensure that they have the money to carry out the job. It is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the present time we are suffering cuts in public expenditure. Even with the limited application of clause 41 to first offenders, the Solicitor-General for Scotland will have to tell us how the Government will cope. I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will be able to tell us that the Government intend to make more money available, that there will be greater opportunities for training and social work, and that there will be a greater endeavour to find more people to enter the profession so that these objectives can be achieved. If he is able to do that, I shall be pleased to join my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden and say that the amendments be not pursued. I hope that we shall receive that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1096</span>
There is no doubt in my mind or in the minds of any of us who are in touch with social workers and who generally support them in the community, that they are over-strained. I do not believe that it serves the interests of the community in Scotland that the Government should make cuts in this area. The workers in this area have never been able to fulfil the remit of the Social Work (Scotland) Act. Although it lays down much that is idealistic, it is rather sad that its objectives have not been achieved. It is also true that as a consequence social work departments are finding different priorities, and that there is a greater priority on one function than on another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BASW paper referred to specialisation. I am not an enthusiast for specialisation. I happen to think that the generic social worker approach to social work, which we in Scotland pioneered, is the right one. When we abandoned the specialisation of the probation service—although it exists within the general framework, of course—and of child care, our objective was to involve the department in the totality of the problems facing our towns and cities and the people in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the right thing to do, but even with that we have lost some ground, because it is simply not possible for local authorities to embrace the generic principle in the way they wish, because they do not have the resources. I hope that today we shall hear from the Solicitor-General that a new dawn has finally broken, that the Government realise the value of social work to the community, that even within the limitations of the clause as it stands, they will make more resources available, and that, having regard to the case advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden, they will make even more resources and allow us to accept my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am in great difficulty regarding both the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). With respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) we are living in cloud-cuckoo-land if we think that the Solicitor-General will in a Standing Committee make major announcements about increases in public expenditure. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is arriving now. He knows
	<span class='label label-info column'>1097</span>
only too well that White Papers on public expenditure are making clear to local authorities that not only will there not be more money next year, there will be less. The Under-Secretary is constantly berating local authorities about cutting down their expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who served for nine years in a local authority, I know that passing legislation which imposes duties on local authorities when Members of Parliament know that the resources will not be available is totally irresponsible. I should like to think that if we were to gain the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) by our rhetoric, argument and intelligent debate, to win this point, and pass the amendment into legislation, the money would automatically become available. I am advised that it is then a Crown responsibility that the money should be available, but experience has shown that that is not so. There is much legislation for this purpose at present on the statute book which local authorities are unable to implement properly for the aftercare of offenders, which is much more important. Therefore I have grave doubts about my hon. Friend pursuing his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that I do not think that the amendments are excellent, or that if we had a Labour Government committed to increased public expenditure these would be ideal, sensible and intelligent amendments. That does not mean that when we have a Labour Government after the next election—which, inevitably, will be soon—we will not have the opportunity when we are repealing clauses 1 to 6, as we shall, of including this type of new provision. Nevertheless, I have grave reservations about supporting my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that it would be irresponsible to pass these amendments on the ground that it would make a charge on the already over burdened local authorities. On the contrary, it is those of us who recognise the necessity of this who would be responsible if we did not pass these amendments. The Government must put their money where their mouth is. They fought a campaign on the issue of law and order, saying that there would be no cuts—on the contrary, that there would be increased expenditure on law and order. They have introduced a clause which involves the use of social workers, or others, to make reports. It is now up to the Government to make good their promises. They have hammered local authorities and cut back unnecessary social provisions, but that is their irresponsibility, not that of the Opposition, who have sought to increase that expenditure and that work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that the police as well as social workers are also involved in community work? There could well be a report from the police, if one reads the clause carefully. The report on the person's background could come from the local police force. Tayside police are certainly active within the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to make his own speech in his own way on how he interprets the clause. We are concerned with the one point that an involvement of social workers would be an undue charge on the local authority. On the contrary, as part of a Criminal Justice Bill it is part of the law and order pledge given by the Conservative Party, and it is up to the Government to fulfil it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a worry that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1099</span>
the Solicitor-General could give a commitment to allow increased expenditure on this aspect of social work and cut back on other aspects? For many of my constituents I would consider that extremely detrimental. He could give such a commitment, and the unemployed, the single-parent families and people who are not in trouble with the law but who need the support of the social work departments would consequently suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The Government are capable of doing almost anything of that nature, which must be opposed. It is not the Opposition's function to advocate a cut-back on one necessary aspect of social work expenditure in order to save another. It is our task to tell the Government that if they make such a pledge they must fulfil it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are so mean-minded, petty and vengeful as to cut other aspects of social work expenditure, they will merely hasten the day when two things will happen—first, a proper understanding by the people of this country of the nonsense of their election pledges, and secondly, the Government's rapid demise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Education (No. 2) Bill, the other place threw out the proposals on school transport. The Government then said that they accepted the will of the other place, but that no more money would be made available, and therefore there would have to be cuts in other areas of education. We know what to expect from the Government, and we must be wary of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I meant by saying that the Government were petty, mean-minded and vengeful. On that occasion they were petty, mean-minded and vengeful towards poor Lord Salisbury and Lord Butler who put forward an irrefutable case which the Government had to accept, but the Government then vented their spite in another form. It is not our job to participate in this Government's vengeful actions; it is not our job to facilitate the attacks that they make upon social work; it is not our job to save their necks when they have made false election promises which they are now apparently unable to fulfil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Solicitor-General declares that the Government will make money available, it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1100</span>
must mean money available from central Government. It must—by definition—be additional expenditure and not money from local authorities and general social work departments. But this is the least that he must do. I shall support my Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), despite the rhetoric of my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire, and I hope that he will stick to his amendments. The Government must have regard to the meaning of their own legislation. Clause 41 must mean something, and if it does mean something, it must be this type of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be said that the onus is on us to support these amendments. On the contrary, these amendments merely spell out what should have been intrinsic to this clause from the beginning—that in all circumstances this should happen. Incidentally, there is no reason to think that there will necessarily be increased expenditure. For example, the paper from the BASWsays:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The concern, therefore, is not that social workers should be asked to provide this service, but that the resources will not be available, mainly through trained staff, to carry out the extra work stemming from better consideration of the needs of adult offenders. Again, the Bill does not provide for, or even mention, the extra costs falling on local authoiity social worker social work departments and without additional resources the purpose of this clause will not be achieved."</p></blockquote>
The point being made here is that they do in any case require the additional resources. But the figures from social workers show that in 1976 2,090 adult first offenders were sent to prison. Underlining the argument in the clause, the most costly way of dealing with offenders is to send them to prison. An extension of these amendments will in fact save cash for the Government rather than increase expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most expensive way of dealing with young offenders is not to send them to prison, because a young offenders institution is even more expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends whether they are under or over 21. By "prison" I include detention in custody. This is an extremely expensive method, and if anything, it would save the Government money if they were to accept my hon. Friend's amendments. Since I cannot appeal on one prong of Morton's fork, perhaps I can appeal on the other. I do not believe that this will of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1101</span>
itself cost money. On the contrary, it can save money. But regardless of that aspect, the duty is upon the Government to fulfil their promise and to put their money where their mouth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that No. 10 or the Chancellor will reject such a promise, remembering their devotion to law and order. If the Solicitor-General for Scotland, who is the leading Law Officer for Scotland in the House of Commons, were to make such a pledge, there is no doubt in my mind that it would have to be fulfilled. I look forward to his reply with eagerness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 41 protects those under 21 who have never had a period of imprisonment because we recognise that it is a major climactic to change a person from an offender to one who has been in prison. That is a step which must be taken with the greatest reluctance. For that reason we believe that clause 41 is an important safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we are sympathetic to what Thomson recommended we should not forget his last sentence, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The case for implementing these proposals should be deferred until such time as the resources of the social work departments are adequate."</p></blockquote>
From whatever side of the House we come, it is irresponsible merely to call for money. All of us can spend money—we can go and buy up Harrods tomorrow and spend it in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or a castle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one had been sensible one could have bought a castle—it costs only £100, so one could have saved some money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, anybody can spend money or run up an overdraft, be it national or private, but the penalties for that on everybody, and particularly on those one is trying to help, are far reaching indeed and we are presently paying those penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Solicitor-General accept that it is equally irresponsible to put legislation on the statute book which cannot operate unless proper resources are made available? Is he suggesting that he is prepared to put that on the statute book and make these sort of speeches to say that resources will not be available because we do no have any money? That is just as irresponsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1102</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a long history of such situations. We had a long stand part speech from the hon. Gentleman the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) who told us of the graces, favours, shortcomings and difficulties of social work departments. I presume that he paid close attention to the marriage service and realises that he is a 
	<i>unum quid</i> with his wife who is a social worker, so perhaps he was speaking as one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to appreciate that the Social Work (Scotland) Act was passed with resources which were claimed to be inadequate by the former Government. There is perhaps no end to the resources which one could spend on these matters in what the hon. Gentleman described as an ideal world—presumably a world without offenders, in which we would have no social workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it was made necessary in all cases, even if a person had been in prison before, there would be a vast number of cases in which it would be a complete waste of time, money and effort on the part of a social worker. I have read hundreds of social work, background and other reports in cases in which they were superfluous in spite of the fact that there was a statutory obligation for them to be made. It is important that Parliament should not put obligations on local authorities for which a large percentage of the work is pointless and superfluous. That cannot be defended by merely saying "It happens to be useful in one case so let us have it in all cases."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite apart from whether what the Solicitor-General regards as useless work is extended in this way—which we do not accept—is he also saying that any additional expenditure caused by the clause will come from local authority expenditure and not from the Government's pledge for more money for law and order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that matter in a moment when I have dealt with the first point. In our view it is not acceptable to extend it to all cases of imprisonment regardless of whether a person has been in prison before or of the circumstances. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court shall obtain (from an officer of a local authority or otherwise) such information as it can about the offender's circumstances".</p></blockquote>
Under clause 41 it does not have to get a social inquiry in every case. It can ask the solicitor, who may be able to provide all
	<span class='label label-info column'>1103</span>
the information the court requires. It can ask a headmaster. It can ask innumerable persons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two points of great importance arise here. It is clear that the Solicitor-General is going to reject the amendment. Is he rejecting it on its merits? Does he regard it as not desirable that there should be a social inquiry report before anyone is sent to prison? If so, the position is much more serious than I expected, which was that he would say merely that the amendment was not practicable because of financial stringency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Solicitor-General has just made a point of great novelty. Is he suggesting that "or otherwise" does not, as I had assumed, refer to a report from another source but refers merely to a subjective judgment by the sheriff that he has heard enough from the plea in mitigation? If he had been sufficiently impressed by the defence solicitor's comprehensive account could the sheriff then send the man to prison, considering that he did not need the report because everything worth hearing had already been told him by the fiscal and the defence solicitor? That is clearly the implication of the Solicitor-General's last few sentences, and if that is what he is saying, clause 41 is total nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The court must be fully informed of the circumstances of the person under clause 41, and it must obtain that information from whatever source.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a totally new factor, and a quite extraordinary one. The Solicitor-General will appreciate that under clause 40 there must be legal representation where someone not previously imprisoned is likely to be sentenced to imprisonment. That means that in a clause 41 situation there will be a legally represented offender before the court. The Solicitor-General now seems to be saying that if the sheriff is satisfied that he has all the information he needs, from a source—the example of a source is the defence solicitor, or, in other words, the plea in mitigation—it is then open to the court to pass a sentence of imprisonment without calling for any report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the sheriffs have that discretion, the procedure under clause 41 is not mandatory even within the narrow group of people for whom it is drawn. It is purely at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1104</span>
the discretion of the sheriff. We are, then, not a whit further forward, and what appears to be a limited but important safeguard has suddenly, by the Solicitor-General's interpretation of the phrase "or otherwise" been blown wide open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cases will differ vastly. For instance, the hon. Gentleman referred to sheriffs, but it may be a High Court judge. Let us suppose that somebody with no previous convictions has been convicted of attempted murder. The background information required in that circumstance to decide whether one considers a sentence of imprisonment appropriate is quite different from that required in a summary case when a person has been convicted of assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the appropriateness of imprisonment will vary over a vast range. The presiding judge will decide what information is appropriate. The slighter the offence, the more information will be required. Similarly, far more information will be required if one is dealing with a younger person. I think that that is obvious
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the issue of expense. Members will appreciate that the new work is expected to be offset by the decrease in the amount of statutory after-care supervision provided by the passage of clause 44 and schedule 5. There will be a major saving there. We expect that that saving will more than compensate for the expense of the present proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I tabled the amendments, because they have resulted in an interesting debate. I personally have been given a totally new insight into how, in the eyes of the Solicitor-General, clause 41 is likely to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said before, I hope that the Solicitor-General is not a typical pair of eyes. But he is the second pair of hands for the legal system in Scotland—or so we are told by 
	<i>The Scotsman</i>—and, I think, the first brain. If that is the product of the first brain, I am very worried indeed. I shall say a word about that shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up the point made— in typically rumbustious style—by my hon. Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). I do not know whether he will have an opportunity to sit on the bench in Ayrshire. However, if he does, I recommend that he read the works of John Gault on the adventures of Provost
	<span class='label label-info column'>1105</span>
Pawkie. It would suit his oratorical style.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend will be aware, with his undoubted legal knowledge, that Members of Parliament are excluded from sitting on the bench. I therefore hope that I never again have the opportunity of sitting on the bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some special talents should be recognised. My hon. Friend's strain of eloquence impressed me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He raises an important point of principle. I accept that we are faced with a dilemma. He was good enough to say that the amendments were admirable in intent and that he strongly supports the idea behind them. I understand his point that it is not right to put statutory duties on the statute book, however admirable, if they can only be carried out at the expense of other important functions of the Government Department or local authority department concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that an important argument is hidden in his speech on that point. I am sure he will accept that the most outstanding recent example was the raising of the school leaving age. For years we were told that it could not be done because of financial stringency and lack of teaching staff. The Committee will remember these battles. Ultimately the nettle was grasped. The school leaving age was raised and many of the difficulties were overcome, because they had to be overcome. When operating among the deeply misconceived attitudes of Government, we shall have to decide whether to go ahead. We should at least record a vote on the amendment, although I understand my hon. Friend's reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason I strongly take that view is that the Solicitor-General's reply is totally unsatisfactory. This limited statutory duty, although not as wide in its scope and coverage as the safeguard which my members wish to write in, nevertheless places a new burden on social work departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However irresponsible—to use the fashionable word in this debate—speakers on the Floor may be, I do not believe that civil servants have been so irresponsible as to persuade the Minister to include this in the Bill without having done their investigations and sums. When the Government were looking at the rate support grant and deciding on financing the local authority, what provision was laid aside, and what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1106</span>
additional factor was put into the budget to account for the clear added burden being laid upon local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I quoted—I think it was from the British Association of Social Workers —a provisional statistic for 1976. There must be more modern statistics as to how many first offenders are sent to prison from the Scottish courts in any one year. I do not know whether their use of the words "first offenders" was exactly tailored to clause 41, because a first offender might be someone who had been fined, but who had not gone to prison, whereas section 41 deals with those who are only first offenders in the sense that they have not previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, I do not believe that the Government have gone ahead with the clause without some idea of how many people are involved, how many court reports will be involved and what percentage will be added to the total work load of the social work departments. We had no estimates or figures. We had nothing at all from the Solicitor-General. In a matter of such importance it is totally unsatisfactory that no attempt should be made to explain the impact of Government policies and how local authorities are expected to manage in this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point, which I wish to make because it came up in the Solicitor-General's speech—some of my hon. Friends will have thought about it—comes down to the interpretation of the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"from an officer of a local authority or otherwise".</p></blockquote>
I took that "or otherwise" to mean that there would be a report from some other third party outwith the agents and the accused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) that it might be the police. I should have severe reservations about that because, although I greatly value police involvement in community work, particularly in Strathclyde, where we are lucky that they have made an effective and far-reaching contribution in that respect, the division between the responsibility of the police and the prosecution of a case should be jealously
	<span class='label label-info column'>1107</span>
guarded. I would not favour the police being asked to provide a court report as an aid to sentencing, because I believe that they should not be involved in the sentencing process in the same way as they are not involved in—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the next amendment. We shall be discussing this point on amendment No. 285. The Solicitor-General for Scotland will probably make his reply then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish briefly, following that guidance, which I find most helpful, Mr. Armstrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons I have given I would not favour the police being involved. Clearly, the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire saw the police as providing a report as an impartial outside body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If "or otherwise" encompasses a situation in which a sheriff can say "I have listened to Mr. Fairbairn"—or the solicitor who might be appearing in a plea in mitigation—"I have heard the facts from the procurator-fiscal. I now sentence you to six months' imprisonment. I shall not call for any social inquiry report because, in my view, I have heard enough about the case." Clearly, that was envisaged by the SoJicitor-General for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause becomes a sham and a deception because if, as defence solicitor, I took an appeal on the ground that, although my client was over 21, he had never been sentenced to imprisonment and he went for six months, without any report being obtained by the local authority or otherwise, the sheriff, in the view of the Solicitor-General for Scotland would have a good explanation which would be accepted by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheriff would be able to say to the court "It is all right. I didn't need to call for any kind of report, because, in my view, I had heard enough." That drives, not a cart and horses, but a bloody Centurion tank through the middle of the clause. I hope that the Solicitor-General will withdraw it for the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let the hon. Gentleman consider this. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the purpose of determining whether any other method of dealing with such a person is appropriate the court shall obtain (from an officer of a local authority or otherwise)".</p></blockquote>

Suppose that the hon. Gentleman says "My client is one of ten children. They have been deserted by their parents. There was nothing for the other children to eat.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly perplexed not only by the law, on which I have expressed my perplexity before, but also by the procedure. With the best will in the world no doubt, you Mr. Armstrong, allowed my hon.

Your kindness, sense and intelligence in allowing my hon. Friend to range so far allow me to take up a number of other points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I was unhappy about voting for my hon. Friend's amendments and why I previously abstained was that I am very concerned about the passage of legislation for which resources—clearly</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1109</span>

	<p>sheriff can send a man to prison, even if he is a first offender 
	<i>simpliciter,</i> solely on the basis of his decision that, having listened to the plea in mitigation, he does not want to bother to obtain a report.</p>

	<p>A protection is a protection. If one says that there are examples in which the protection is not needed and, therefore, it is to be eliminated, there will be need for the protection and that loophole will be used. If the Solicitor-General for Scotland's interpretation is right, the clause is nothing more than waste paper.</p>

	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>

	<p>We have a number of submissions that, even with what the Government suggest in clause 41, without my hon. Friend's amendment, will pose extremely difficult problems for the social work departments. In the context of the additional responsibilities placed on social work departments by the current clauses—not the amended clauses—how will the resources be made available? As my hon. Friend asked, is the rate support grant to be increased substantially to take account of this?</p>

	<p>I am a strong advocate of the social work departments. I think that the professionalism in that sphere should be encouraged to develop. I confess—if this is an opportunity for confession—that the person to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden earlier referred as having described the mini-skirted dolly-bird social workers was myself, when I was a member of the Edinburgh social work committee. Indeed, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Rifkind), the Under-Secretary for Scotland, was a member of the same local authority.</p>

	<p>At that time we were arguing that many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1110</span>
young and inexperienced social workers were having to deal with grave social problems, and we suggested that people with wider experience might be recruited to the profession by means of a special recruitment scheme similar to that for teachers. Now many more experienced workers have been recruited, and I may, in retrospect, regret having used that description.</p>

	<p>The Yellow press—not, of course, 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> and the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i>—gave the matter the wrong slant. I have a great regard for the social work profession. I remind my hon. Friends that it is under a grave strain at present. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) said, we have generic social workers in Scotland. Social workers are not just faced with the problem of deciding on priorities in dealing with offenders as to whether to have to produce more and more reports to the court or deal with the aftercare of the offenders. They also have to deal with the other areas of social work.</p>

	<p>Not BASW or the Lothian director but the Association of Directors of Social Work says that more and more reports have been provided under existing legislation, and yet the use of probation has declined. So the current position is that, although more and more reports are being made available to the courts, the practice does not seem to indicate that the courts are using those reports to avoid imprisonment and to make greater use of probation.</p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>The association goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The implementation of clause 41 without any extra resources would only serve to exacerbate this situation."</p></blockquote>
It then says that the validity and the usefulness of reports to the courts will become less and less if they are provided in a ritualistic, procedural way. If they have this major responsibility, if there is a huge burden of providing reports, it will be done as a ritual in a casual, speedy way, instead of the detailed professional way that the social workers would like to do it.</p>

	<p>There is the dilemma of the social worker dealing only with the treatment of offenders or being able to spend more and more time on aftercare. My hon. Friendand I would like more time spent on aftercare and less time spent on the ritual of provid-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1111</span>
ing reports. The reports should be provided in areas where they are particularly useful and where experience has shown that they are valuable.</p>

	<p>As I have said, the generic social workers do not deal only with offenders. They are the same social workers as deal with the mentally handicapped, for whom provision is lamentable at present. They are the same social workers as may be called out to deal with the problem of an old person living alone. We have examples—we have had them year after year—of many old people living alone in cold, damp surroundings, who are found dead days, weeks and sometimes months after they have died. That will happen more often if social workers become tied up with more and more red tape and reports.</p>

	<p>It is all very difficult unless more resources are made available. I am not saying that these duties should not be put upon the social workers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) said, we should like to see them take on this responsibility. But when a social worker is faced with the problem, on the one hand, of dealing with an old person who may die if he or she does not get support, or, on the other hand, providing written reports for the courts, I can see the dilemmas and difficulties that arise in the minds of social workers.</p>

	<p>I am concerned that clause 41 puts an extra burden on the social work departments without the extra resources. That is said by BASW and by the Lothian social work department, and it is said by the Association of Directors of Social Work. I therefore ask the Solicitor-General for Scotland to indicate, after consultation with the Under-Secretary and other appropriate persons if necessary, what extra resources will be available for this purpose.</p>

	<p>Amendment No. 286 is equally important. It asks that the court shall take into account the social circumstances of the person concerned as well as the
	<br><blockquote><p>"character and physical and mental condition".</p></blockquote>
I include social circumstances because they can often be the most important factor in deciding—</p>

The court
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall … take into account any information … concerning the offender's character and physical and mental condition".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, "circumstances" covers all circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I underlined that in my copy of the Bill for precisely the purpose that the Solicitor-General has indicated, namely, to ascertain whether it included social circumstances. I should like to see "social circumstances" specifically included as one of the areas of which account must be taken. They are especially important. They are very important to the understanding of how crime arises in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether Conservative Members ever see the circumstances that lead some people into crime. Do they realise the difficulties that many young people might experience, the grinding despair that is created by the inability, year after year, to obtain a job? The unemployment statistics for Scotland indicate that a larger percentage than in the United Kingdom as a whole are unemployed for more than two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether Conservative Members realise, for example, the difficulties that will be created by the cutbacks that they are imposing in education. Do they understand how, because of those difficulties, more and more people are turning reluctantly and almost inadvertently to crime of various sorts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do Conservative Members realise what they are doing by cutting back on recreational opportunities? It is all right for them. They can afford their expensive membership of golf clubs and all the wonderful recreational opportunities that are open to them. Indeed, I can too, as my "pair" the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's confessions are going a bit wide. I ask him to return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When reading the colour supplement of 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> last week I was inspired when I learnt of the recreational pursuits of the Solicitor-General. However, many of my constituents and those of my hon. Friends do not have those recreational opportunities. Their
	<span class='label label-info column'>1113</span>
recreational opportunities are being diminished by the Government's cutbacks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When those people appear before the court it is important that detailed information is available about their social circumstances. As I said in the Scottish Grand Committee, the sheriffs and judges live in great circumstances. On the whole, our sheriffs and judges come from a public school background or, as we properly call it in Scotland, a private school background. It is important that they understand and have specific, clear information about the social circumstances of those who appear before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a clear and explicit statement from the Solicitor-General about the resources that are to be made available, including those to implement the proposals in clause 41. We also want social circumstances to be taken into account when offenders appear before those exalted sheriffs and judges. That is not too much to ask. I hope that the Solicitor-General will be able to answer the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal very briefly with both matters. The hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) answered his own case for inserting "social circumstances". In his judicial declamation he said "I do not believe that Conservative hon. Members understand the circumstances in which people live". As there is a statutory requirement to know the circumstances—namely, the social circumstances—that issue is covered by the statute. That is exactly the sort of thing that all these reports, from whatever source, will cover. We want to know whether the person concerned is more sinned against or sinning, and that is the factor covered by "circumstances".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that central Government must not impose disparate and separate duties on local authorities and then ask them "Why are you spending so much?" However, clause 44 and schedule 5 remove considerable burdens from the requirements of the social work departments. Their work will be different, their burden will not be more and the Government are satisfied that the requirements will be covered by the savings in clause 44 and schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say in passing, hoping that I will not disturb the waters, that if amendment No. 285 is passed it will aggravate rather
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty, Mr. Armstrong, and I hope that you will guide us. I absolutely agree with amendment No. 286, but I want to know whether this is the appropriate moment to discuss the issue that arose earlier, when it was virtually suggested that a report could come from anywhere, including from the defence solicitor.

	<i>adjourned the Committee without Question put. pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1115</span>

	<p>West (Mr. Buchan) has raised an important point. As the Solicitor-General for Scotland rightly and kindly pointed out, my amendment would exacerbate the problem raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). I do not intend to pursue amendment No. 285, but it is an opportunity to discuss this phrase. I cannot understand why it is in brackets, or what is meant by "or otherwise".</p>

	<p>I appreciate the points raised earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Garscadden, that it raises a lot of doubts about who might be able to provide the reports and that it might be possible to slip something in with a minimal report. Therefore, I am prepared, if we are to have a discussion on that topic, to leave it to clause stand part. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
