	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. For the Committee to hear me speak once on this subject is interesting; to hear me twice is a pleasure; to hear me three times is an unmitigated delight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a brief recap of my intervention. The Minister made it clear to the Committee that students post 18 could be educated in maintained schools. Can the Minister give a categoric assurance that students aged 19 and more will continue to attract funding for their school places? There cannot be a member of the Committee who does not want to know whether they will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that the Secretary of State now and the funding agency for schools in future will, under the Bill's arrangements, include annual maintenance grant calculations in deliberations on a school's funding. Any 19-year-olds who have begun their studies before their 19th birthdays will be included in the form 7 returns on which funding will be based. Schools can use their AMGs to pay for the education of such pupils and the three categories that the hon. Gentleman referred to will be covered. Not only can I confirm that, but I can confirm the funding arrangements. They are as the hon. Gentleman and the rest of the Committee would have wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only wish I had had the presence of mind to intervene on the Minister before dinner. I have a question about paragraph 4(a) relating to part-time exclusions, which I am sure that the Minister will have considered. A pupil aged over 16 with special educational needs may have begun to attend a local college part-time while still at school to ease the transition from school. There are several examples of this. Organisations of the disabled, including Deaf Accord, have expressed concern that grant-maintained schools will not receive the funding to allow the continuation or the setting up of such an arrangement should they have special needs pupils who want to go on to college but do not want to make the transition in one leap. Will the Minister confirm that they will be covered, despite subsection 4(a)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take a chance and give the hon. Gentleman a snap answer and then consider it more
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
carefully and write to him. Such pupils could expect to be registered as pupils at one or other of the institutions and we would expect the two institutions to make appropriate arrangements between them to ensure that such pupils were properly covered. I am satisfied that the Bill provides for that and that the arrangements could easily and properly be made. That is an initial response. I shall take another look and either confirm what I have said or inform the hon. Gentleman if there is anything different. I do not expect the answer to differ greatly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SPECIAL PURPOSE GRANTS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 267 in, page 43, line 5, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the financial year or, as the case may be, each of the financial years to which the grant relates".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 268, in clause 75, page 44, line 45, after "grant", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of any financial year".</p></blockquote>
This probing amendment is interesting rather than important. In view of the pressure on time, it may be best if I speak briefly to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Précis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the seated intervention from the hon. Gentleman who suggests that I precis my comments. I am more than happy to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 79(1) of the 1988 Act refers to the annual maintenance grant being specifically
	<br><blockquote><p>"expenditure … incurred or to be incurred by the governing body in the financial year to which any such grant relates."</p></blockquote>
I have tabled the amendment to find out why the Bill does not tie the special purposes grants to a specific year. Funding authorities are to be regarded as non-departmental bodies and will be required to follow the guide for NDPBs, which outlines clearly the need for annual reports and budgets. I do not see how that can possibly happen if the grants are not tied to a single year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also anxious about the possible implications for the use of unspent moneys and the possibility of SPG money being subsumed into the annual maintenance grant. Those important questions need to be answered. I hope that the Minister will treat the amendments as a probe and respond accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. In response to his gentle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>927</span>
probing, I shall try to cover briefly the points that he raises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally speaking, although it is expected that SPGs will be given annually, there are some important examples of non-annual or continuing purposes for which special grants may be made. I shall give a few. Special purpose grants may be made for early retirement, so payments would continue over a long period. Another grant might be given to help schools meet the cost of insurance for the premises; this also would be a continuing payment. I need not weary the Committee with other examples. I wish merely to establish the principle that special purpose grants can and will be given for purposes that go beyond one year. Therefore it would be wrong to limit them to an annual basis, as the amendment would do, although my right honourable and learned Friends in the Treasury might be intrigued and pleased by the proposal. Indeed, if they were members of the Committee, they might support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>9.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I should have hated him to finish his remarks before I had an opportunity to respond. The hon. Gentleman cited examples of continuing purposes for grants, but they are no different from the continuing nature of the purposes for which annual maintenance grant is given. For example, the employment of teachers, if it were continued, would presumably have some on-going element, too. I have difficulty in understanding the difference between the examples that the Minister is giving and those examples of the use to which annual maintenance grant could be and is put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is due to the way in which we have had to define the purposes of different grants. It means that such matters fall within the use of special purpose grants. That is how the lines of definition were drawn. I suppose that they could have been drawn differently, but the purposes are sufficiently special that they are dealt with by special grants. As long as it is conceivable that there may be matters of a continuing nature that are best dealt with by special purpose grants, to limit such grants artificially to an annual basis would be unduly restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way to deal with the issue is administratively, under the detailed financial conditions in clause 74(6). That would take into account the relevant grant regulations that would then be enforced. I am not arguing that the point of the amendment should be lost altogether, but that it can and will be dealt with satisfactorily under the aegis of the clause that we are yet to debate. For those reasons, the amendment would be unduly restrictive and I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am not entirely happy with the Minister's response. The few examples that he cited have a specific sum attached to them for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>928</span>
specific year. At present, special purposes grants cover development, restructuring, value added tax and premises. It is possible to identify the annual costs of each issue. For example, a specific amount is allocated to cover the cost of insuring premises—£6,000 or half of the actual cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly said that clause 74(6) enables certain requirements to be specified. Nevertheless, it is strange that that greater freedom is attached to the special purposes grant, not to the annual maintenance grant. At the outset I said that I was interested in exploring the issue. Perhaps it can be examined in more detail on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 541, in page 43, line 12, leave out 'or'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 542, in page 43, line 12, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) in making any provision under sub-section (b) above, in conjunction with any other school or local education authority, for meeting any special educational needs of the population of the wider area than the area served by the school, or"</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>No. 543, in clause 78, page 46, line 11, leave out 'or'.</p>

	<p>No. 544, in clause 78, page 46, line 11, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) in making any provision under subsection (b) above, in conjunction with any other school or local education authority, for meeting any special educational needs of the population of the wider area than the area served by the school, or"</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to encourage grant-maintained schools to work with other schools or local education authorities to make provision for children from an area wider than that usually served by the school. Clause 72 will enable grant-maintained schools to have a share in the grants that are made available for training and education purposes for LEAs. LEAs must bid for those grants and many of them are not accepted. Each grant has a specific purpose and, if the bid is successful, the LEA receives funding for a particular time to continue the work for which the grant was given. The special purpose grants for grant-maintained schools have no similar conditions: the schools do not have to apply for the grants, or specify the special purpose for which they will use the money, or provide such information to the Department for Education. An LEA must provide 40 per cent. of the funding, whereas grant-maintained schools need not top up the special purpose grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that work currently funded through the grant for education support and training programme—it started in 1992 for deaf-blind children and is due to end in 1994—should be available for grant-maintained schools. While we may not believe in the principle of such schemes, once they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
are working we want full participation in the provision of education for children with all types of need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present there are eight consortia, covering 32 LEAs, which work on providing services for deaf-blind children—a small number, but, nevertheless, children with special needs. All those participating in the scheme are happy with the way in which the scheme is developing. The consortia are trying to find ways to get the extra funding themselves when the Department for Education grant ends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that our amendment will allow grant-maintained schools to participate in a similar programme with other schools or LEAs, providing, for example, for deaf-blind children with special needs, but without statements. Clause 72 does not give such an opportunity, although I hope that the Minister is able to tell me otherwise. We have it on record that the amendment is unnecessary, but I hope that he will consider, ith favour, the purpose of the amendment and either take it on board and redraft it or tell us specifically that it is covered by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman something that I raised on Second Reading? When the GEST funds for such a purpose for an area are allocated to a particular school, what happens if that school becomes grant-maintained? Can we ensure that that service continues? I add that point to the hon. Gentleman's remarks so that the Minister can reply to the whole problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for intervening, because the principle was raised on Second Reading. At one time, I had the relevant part of the debate with me, but I have mislaid it. Anyway, having covered the point, I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask about the use of special purpose grants, in Wales, but first I shall speak about the general principle of the grants. I shall speak to the clause as well as to the amendment, if that is acceptable to you Sir John, as it will be more convenient to speak once than twice. Perhaps you will give me guidance as I proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We shall see how we go. I take the hon. Gentlemen's point and I am prepared, on the basis of what he has said, to let him proceed—at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seems to give the lie to he idea that grant-maintained schools are able to escape from some kind of local authority stranglehold—the word used previously—and enter a system in which they are free to exercise their own discretion. The special purpose grants provisions seem to give enormous and undefined power to the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
Special purpose grants will, as I understand them, be used for some of the purposes presently dealt with by the LEA from the proportion of revenue spending that it reclaims for various purposes. The split in Dyfed county council at the moment is 85 per cent. to the schools for their own use, and 15 per cent. that is retained by the authority for various purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sum that is retained is used at the LEA's discretion for activities that it considers to be socially beneficial. They could be subsidies for the swimming pool, theatre in education, the maintenance of a theatre that plays an important community role in the county, or perhaps the provision of a more generous pupil-teacher ratio for small rural schools. There are many other activities that I shall mention later with reference to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general impression has been given that grant-maintained status gives schools all their revenue money with which to pursue their own choices and purposes, but that is belied by the clause. It can be seen from clause 72 that grant-maintained schools would have to go, cap in hand, perhaps, to the funding agency, which would then be able to prioritise at its own discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sum will the funding authorities retain for special purpose grants—especially those to be paid for the expenses of particular occasions or periods? What percentage of the funding agency's budget will be retained to be distributed then as special purpose grants? Is there anything to prevent its being greater than the percentage currently retained by the LEA for such purposes? It appears that schools will be just as much at the mercy of the funding authority as schools can now be said to be at the mercy of LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distribution of special purpose grants from the funding agency to grant-maintained schools would seem to be a less flexible and efficient way than the present system of providing for relevant needs. I should like the Minister to give an account of how it is envisaged that some of the activities maintained by the 15 per cent. of revenue now retained by the LEAs will be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give some examples of the current uses of that 15 per cent. in Gwynedd and Dyfed. Youth organisations meet in schools. The young farmers clubs and the Welsh League of Youth clubs meet in schools and the LEA covers the cost of the caretaker's presence for such occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the eisteddfod visits a locality, committees are held over a period of two years. They meet in school buildings free of charge. Arrangements for local eisteddfodau also involve the use of school halls, which are provided by the LEA free of charge. When such a network of events occurs, all that is required is one decision to be taken by the LEA, but in future a series of decisions will have to be taken by individual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>931</span>
9.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to discuss the residential camps owned by the Welsh League of Youth, the Urdd. The camps are essential for the development and operation of language policy in some parts of Wales. At such camps weekend courses are held, but sometimes the courses last for a week. Several schools will send their pupils to the courses and the arrangements are made by the LEA. The LEA will cover at least some of the costs of the courses which are held as part of its language policy. Through the use of its advisory staff, the LEA will also help to put on the courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the LEA organises such courses, it will deal directly with the Urdd, the Welsh League of Youth, as a single movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those courses are important for the development of language policy in schools. There are courses for new learners of Welsh, courses for near fluent speakers and further courses for fluent native speakers to enable them to develop their language skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of grant-maintained schools means that the operation of the courses will require negotiations with individual schools. There will not be one set of negotiations between the movement that organises the courses and the LEA. In those circumstances, I presume that SPGs will be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the national eisteddfod visits an area, pupils will take part in rehearsals to prepare for a major cultural event, such as a pageant, for a long time. Scores of pupils from many schools—mainly primary schools but also secondary schools—will participate. The LEA will enable its advisory staff to conduct rehearsals so the costs are provided, in a concealed sense, by the LEA. Teachewrs will be released from their duties in schools to conduct rehearsals and the LEA will provide supply teachers to take their place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example is the use of what are called in Welsh athrawon bro—district teachers. They carry out invaluable work dealing with the complex linguistic position in what were entirely Welsh-speaking areas before rapid demographic change brought about by many English-speaking families moving into them. The district teachers, the athrawon bro, are essential in such areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered only a few of the services provided by LEAs. I assume that in future those services will, in some way, be provided by SPGs if the grant-maintained status movement takes off in Wales and many schools opt out. I have grave worries about the maintenance of that network of services and provisions, which is vital for the maintenance and promotion of the Welsh language. That looms very large in the educational scene in Wales, and that network of provisions is beginning to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What proportion of the funding will be retained by the schools funding council for Wales for SPGs?
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
When will that proportion be decided? Will there be a guarantee that this vital network will be maintained under the new regime? Does the Minister believe that that network can be maintained when there is a mixture of LEA and grant-maintained schools or when, as in the Conservative dream scenario, all schools are grant maintained? Will the network of services be provided more efficiently than at present? Finally, what mechanisms will the Government set up to ensure that the services are provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can fairly readily give the assurance requested by the hon. Member for Bridgend and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis). Clause 72 will not prevent the continuation of the cooperative regimes and arrangements between grant-maintained schools and LEA schools or LEAs. I understand the motivation behind the amendment, but it is unnecessary, as the clause allows the present arrangements to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has slipped my mind, so I hope that he will repeat it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked whether it would be ensured that the GEST funds provided to one school to look after an area's deaf-blind needs, for example, would be maintained if that school were to go grant maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend—it must be the lateness of the hour, or something—but the answer to that question is yes, as it was to the question asked by the hon. Member for Bridgend. Those funds will be secure and will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis), there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a continuation of the arrangements that he described, albeit in a different way. When more and more schools, after the due process of the parental ballot, decided to become grant maintained, we must accept that things will change and that the arrangements that the hon. Gentleman described are unlikely to remain unaltered. However, there is no reason why grant-maintained schools, individually or in co-operation with other schools or LEAs, should not continue to make the type of provisions that have obtained in the past. The Bill would not prevent that. Providing each school can decide that those arrangements are a reasonable and proper use of its premises or grant, they can continue. I concede that people may have to arrange matters rather differently, but that should not inhibit the arrangements that were described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North asked a more detailed question about which percentage of what would apply when. I must reserve my position and that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by saying that the detailed, appropriate arrangements for England and Wales will be made under the watchful eyes of the Secretary of State and the Welsh Office. Like the English

arrangements, they are likely to be broadly in line with those in force at present. The hon. Gentleman will understand that it would be wrong and irresponsible of me to give commitments in advance. He can, however, be reassured that things will not be radically or dramatically different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee need have no fears; arrangements mentioned by hon. Members will continue as in the past. In many respects, they may be strenthened by the new independent and diverse provision of education by grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I described amendment No. 267 as being interesting but not important. This amendment is most important because it would provide balance. We agree that most of the Bill centres on the means by which a school can become grant-maintained. However, if this group of amendments is not accepted, nothing in the Bill would enable a grant-maintained school to terminate that status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and other Conservative members of the Committee referred to the concept of democracy and how vital to that concept parental balloting is. Conservative Members stressed their wish that parents should have the right to determine the future of their schools. The Bill and the Education Reform Act 1988 give a particular group of parents, at a particular time, considerable power. The concept of parent power has been referred to many times by Conservative Members. Sadly, evidence suggests that the power that they wish to give to parents can be exercised only when it is likely that parents' decisions will support Tory party dogma. Notice is taken of the wishes of parents only if they are in line with Tory party philosophy. After all, 93 per cent. of parents wanted the Inner London education authority to be retained but those wishes were ignored. Many parents desperately seek increased resources for education, yet their wishes are ignored. Parents are increasingly anxious for the Minister to take a decision to postpone the introduction of key stage 3 SATs for English, but those wishes are also ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this Government, the democratic power given to parents is like a one-way valve. They can vote on anything, as long as the vote goes a certain way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>937</span>
They are not given the democratic power to vote to reverse an earlier decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At national and local elections, as part of the normal democratic process, people are given an opportunity every few years to think again and to decide whether they want to change their minds about a decision that was taken a few years earlier and vote for a different political party and policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That two-way process, which is so much a part of democracy should be included in the Bill. The amendments would achieve that, by providing the mechanism through which we could have that important two-way process. The opportunity to terminate grant-maintained status was not included merely for the sake of the democratic principle. There are many circumstances in which the termination of grant-maintained status may be in the interests of the quality of a school's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents should be given an opportunity to exercise choice in the face of changing circumstances. The changing circumstances may lead parents to feel that the termination of grant-maintained status is in the best interests of the maintenance of the quality of education in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More simply, parents may take the view that grant-maintained status seemed a good idea at the time but that now they have had the chance to experience it, they realise that they have come to a dead end. Such parents should be given the opportunity to change their minds. It may be that the much-vaunted and promised benefits of grant-maintained status do not materialise. Again, parents should be given an opportunity to reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the much-predicted avalanche of grant-maintained schools does not occur, it is possible that some grant-maintained schools will be isolated from the rest of the school community and miss out on exchanging ideas about best practice. In such circumstances, parents should be given the opportunity to change their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a reult of the restrictions in clause 244, a grant-maintained school may find that it is unable to avail itself of excellent local education authority services such as the advisory service, inset provision, and music provision. In those circumstances, parents should perhaps be given an opportunity to re-think grant-maintained status so that they can again avail themselves of those excellent services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fears were expressed about sponsor governors, who may lead a school in a direction with which many parents are uncomfortable. In that situation also, parents ought to be given an opportunity to change their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers that the amendments would provide would make the head teacher, staff and governors more accountable to parents. Those are some
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
examples of the way in which the amendment would provide an opportunity to address the issue of the quality of education. No Conservative Members could fail to acknowledge the possibility that a grant-maintained school might arrive at a situation in which the quality of its provision falls dramatically and in which the governors lose the confidence of the parents. That possibility is reflected in the Bill. Clauses 56 and 59 provide solutions should that situation arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that, the guillotine prevents me moving a number of amendments that would have provided opportunities to prevent the sort of breakdown that I described. The amendments would create measures to ensure the inclusion of a management plan in the proposals for grant-maintained status, and measures to place greater emphasis on the appraisal of head teachers and ensure that the annual report includes reference to the steps taken by the governing body to improve the quality of provision in the school. Sadly, those amendments have not been selected for debate. Therefore, in the event of breakdown, we are left only with clauses 56 and 59, which introduce the concept of replacement or additional governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those measures assume a local availability of suitable new governors with sufficient time, skill and expertise to help rescue the school from its difficulty. Such governors might be available in urban areas, but additional governors might be hard to find in rural areas. Many problems are associated with limiting the only support mechanisms to the two in the Bill at present. It is interesting to note that even the concept of education assocations does not seem to apply to grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment and proposed new clauses would offer a school that has got into difficulty, perhaps through mismanagement of the governing body, a chance to return to LEA status and possibly to use the powers in the Education Reform Act 1988 to return it to LEA status with the local management of schools delegation removed. I hope that I have demonstrated that they would avoid binding successive generations of parents to the decision of one particular generation and would establish a fairer reflection of the two-way process that is an important element in the democratic process. Moreover, they would provide a set of mechanisms to help safeguard the quality of education provision for pupils in future generations. Ironically, with the knowledge that a decision can be reversed in future, parents might be more persuaded than they would otherwise have been to vote for grant-maintained status in the first instance. That might make the amendment more attractive to Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to an important point, of which Conservative Members must be aware. It would not be right for people to be able to vote first one way and then the other way, willy-nilly, every other week. There must be a period of stability. That is why the amendment and proposed new clauses make clear
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>939</span>
that it would not be possible to hold ballots to terminate GM status for up to two years after such status was achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members will be interested in the responses from Conservative Members and the Minister. If they support the amendment, that will give them sole justification for their claims to want to devolve decision-making powers to the parents in a particular area. However, if they oppose it, either on principle or on a clever technical objection, that will remove their credibility and will demonstrate to everyone that they are really interested, not in genuine democracy and parent power, but in pushing forward by whatever means Tory party dogma. I hope that they will take the former view and support the amendment to demonstrate conclusively that they genuinely believe in the democratic processes that they say that the Bill is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to a great principle that involves practical consequences. It is whether a group of transient parents—which they will be because they will not have children at the school all the time—has the right to determine, for ever and a day, the status of a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate, we discussed whether a school should always be in the ownership of one group of parents. The Opposition argued that a school should be regarded as a community resource, but our amendments along those lines were defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to a proposal that a vote by a set of parents for a school to be grant-maintained should not, as I said, determine its status for ever and a day. That is the issue of principle. There have been ballots in the past two or three years where, in my view, parents were deceived into voting for GM status because of promises that additional resources would be made available to a school that achieved it. Earlier today, we heard that those promises of additional funding can no longer be delivered by the Government because of their current financial difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the information that at a recent conference in Sheffield, organised by the Department for Education to promote grant-maintained schools, a GM head was warned against opting out on financial grounds, is evidence that the initial bribes are drying up? Is not that another reason why carers, head teachers, governing bodies and anyone associated with schools might want to review their position after their experience of GM status because it does not live up to the image portrayed to them on so many occasions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend shows clearly the way in which head teachers and parents have been deceived into entering the grant-maintained sector. Those promises are no longer on offer and we have the example of head teachers of GM schools stating publicly and clearly that the attractions of financial incentives have disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>940</span>
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth argued that the real attraction of GM status is that it provides heads and governors with the freedom to run their schools. Perhaps that freedom was lacking two or three years ago and it may have been provided by GM status. However, the majority of schools are operating under local management with budgets provided by their local education authorities, so they have freedom under the present local authority setup. That provides the benefit of exercising day-to-day responsibility in schools with the important safey net of the protection and support of individual LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents have been deceived into voting in favour of GM status, so some are now questioning whether they made the correct decision. The Minister will urge the Committee to vote against the amendments because the Government do not want to give parents a chance to think again and vote their schools back to the LEA sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall listen to the Minister with interest to learn why he wishes to deny parents the opportunity of opting schools back into LEA care. We have heard much this evening about the exercise of democracy, but if the Government reject the amendments they will be denying those parents choice and a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments propose not an imposed parental ballot on continued grant-maintained status, but an option to choose. One would have thought that, if the grant-maintained initiative had been the resounding success that the Government would have us believe, they would welcome the opportunity for parents to vote resoundingly in favour of grant-maintained status. What are the Government scare of?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experiment has failed. If the Government reject the amendments, it will be a triumph of political dogma over democracy. If the Minister denies parents the choice to vote for that reason, he will rightly stand condemned by future generations for his inability to recognise parents' right to the democratic choice whether to return to local authority control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and the speech of the hon. Member for Devonport. It is worth recalling that the decision to become grant maintained is of the deepest significance for the school and the community. It has already been pointed out that one generation of parents take the decision. It is also true that it can be made by a minority of those parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governing body starts the process by a simple majority vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that could represent a minority of the governing body. For example, on a governing body of 16 members, three of whom are absent when the vote is taken, a minority of the governors can set the process in motion. The same is true of the ballot. A simple majority is required on a single ballot for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>941</span>
which only 50 per cent. of parents are required to turn out. A school can become grant maintained as a result of a decision taken by a minority of governors and a minority of parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That can happen without reference to the wider community. I tabled an amendment to clause 25 that would have made special provision for Wales to enable community consultation. Unfortunately, because of the guillotine motion, that amendment was not discussed. However, I shall seek to reintroduce it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that objections may be presented. That is not the same as allowing the systematic consultation of the community, the recording of its view and for that view to be either a veto of the process or a significant opinion to be considered by the Secretary of State when deciding a school's application for grant-maintained status. I devised a mechanism for such consultation in Wales through the community councils that exist throughout Wales. I shall certainly table that amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the lack of safeguards to ensure that the original decision to become grant maintained genuinely reflects the wish of the community—indeed of parents—it would be intolerable if such a decision were irreversible.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir John, I welcome you back to our deliberations. I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend, who spoke about the change of mind that might occur in a community or in a local school. Governors might recommend, and parents might accept, that they should return to local authority control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
I hope that the Minister of State, Welsh Office, as well as the Under-Secretary of State for Schools, will be able to respond to my argument. Many governing bodies will be rushed, or even panicked, into making a decision. Only this week the local education authorities in Wales have been pressing the Secretary of State for Wales to reconsider the grant settlement to county councils with respect to education budgets. If budgets are cut by local education authorities, they will be cut by the schools. Schools may see in grant-maintained status an opportunity to avoid such reductions in speding. In months or years to come, governors and parents may conclude that they took the wrong decision and that it would be best, after all, to return to local education authority control and all the security that that offers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North on the previous amendment are extremely pertinent. A Welsh-medium school in the Rhymney valley called Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, provides a classic example. The governing body recently wrote to all parents with children at that school, whose catchment area extends beyond the Rhymney Valley to other parts of Mid Glamorgan. The school has suffered for some time because of problems of repairs. The buildings are inadequate and unsatisfactory. Because of the problems of the local education authority in maintaining the school, the governors want to apply for grant-maintained status—not simply for repairs to take place, but for a new school to be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the letter that was sent to parents, the chairman of the governing body said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will arrange a ballot for you on G.M. Status provided that we are certain that we will get a new school."</p></blockquote>
That is an entirely new situation. We have heard about the problems and anxieties that LEAs are experiencing because of repairs and maintenance, but the possibility of opting out in order to get a new school is a completely new dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governors go on to say that there are good reasons for that. I am glad that the Minister of State is present, as they are worried about the state of the roads surrounding the school. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Governing Body is extremely concerned for the safety of pupils at this school … There have been a number of near misses, including Sir Wyn Roberts' chauffeur, who was almost knocked down by a fast speeding taxi during his visit to the school three years ago."</p></blockquote>
Happily, the Minister of State, and presumably his chauffeur—or chauffeuse—are still reasonably well, but that is hardly a good enough reason for a school to become grant-maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the final page of that letter—if that is what it is—the governing body states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that there is an answer in the future, however, and we know that the Minister of State is empowered to provide funding for the construction of a new school building as described in Schedule 5 of the Education (Grant Maintained School) (Finance) Regulations 1990. This is why we are seeking a meeting with him personally."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
That school has decided to seek grant-maintained status not because it sees a new Jerusalem before it but because it wants improvements to the school buildings, which the local education authority cannot provide due to the cuts, and it wants a new school altogether. When parents and governors meet the Minister of State in a few weeks, he may say no to both requests. Presumably, the grant-maintained application will then be dropped. If the Minister does not make a positive response, the school may well go ahead. But what will happen if a new school does not emerge? The parents and governors might decide to not continue with the application for grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with my hon Friend the Member for Wallsend. The Bill should give parents in Wales the same opportunity as parents in England to opt back in. If democracy means anything, it must surely mean that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was studying the faces of Opposition Members closely to assess whether they were serious. I came to the conclusion that they were reasonably serious. However, we are now involved in a piece of high-grade mischief-making. The Conservative party has never said that that option would be open for the grant-maintained sector—not in election manifestos, or in White Papers. No pretence has been made that it would be sensible or advisable to allow a two-way process, as suggested by the Opposition. I am now able to coin a phrase for the Opposition: the one thing that would result from that prescription would be chaos and confusion. I cannot imagine the chaos that would ensue if schools were allowed to ballot every two years to go in and out of grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave aside the question of what would happen if a school terminated its grant-maintained status. That is not provided for. The schools would be left in limbo or suspended animation. I leave that to one side—it is the sort of objection that has become known to the Committee as rather technical and we should not become too involved in that argument. The real debate should be about the denial of parental choice. Because of the late hour, I shall restrain myself—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] We have other clauses to debate and I do not want to detain the Committee. I shall therefore restrain myself from embarking on a homily about the lack of parental choice when schools were forced to become comprehensive by the Opposition and the total lack of choice for schools that did not do so. I shall leave that to one side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that his noble Friend the Baroness Thatcher was wonderful at setting up comprehensive schools. The county that voluntarily established the most comprehensive schools was the Conservative-controlled West Riding of Yorkshire.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it was Labour legislation, which did not mention parents or provide for ballots. I shall

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition wish to prolong our proceedings. I shall indulge them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised an important point of principle. I know of no authority where it has happened, but LEAs that have comprehensive school systems have a legal right to revert to a system of selection. Grant-maintained schools should, therefore, have the right to return to LEA control. Solihull LEA wished to revert to a selective system, but did not do so because of the strength of parental opposition. However, the right to do that exists in law, Grant-maintained schools should have the same right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition are obsessed by what LEAs can do, We talk about parents and parental ballots. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Opposition are very excited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that we are obsessed by LEAs yet the amendment would allow parents to make a choice; it has nothing to do with LEAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not realistic to allow schools to flip flop in and out of grant-mnaintained status every two years. Under such a provision, schools could exert undue pressure on parents, LEAs and the funding agency for schools by threatening to change their status every two years. That makes no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath asked whither parental choice. Parents can elect governors; they can choose another school if they are not satisfied with the school that their child attends. If, during an election campaign, a political party was sufficiently crazy to pledge to abolish grant-maintained schools, disillusioned parents could vote for that party. That is the ultimate expression of parental choice. It will be interesting to observe whether the growth of the grant-maintained sector will give the Labour party any reason to make such a pledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like the Minister to address the consequences of the Bill, not the events of a future general election campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is reluctant to tackle choice. He has not answered many points that the Opposition have raised. If the Government support parental choice, why do not they extend it to parents who wish to return a grant-maintained school to LEA control? Why does the Minister deny parents the choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our judgment, it does not make educational sense to allow successive generations of parents to ballot in and out of grant-maintained status every two years. That is unrealistic and would be destructive to the educational process, which, all of a sudden, Opposition Members seems not to care about at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if we were to accept the Minister's analysis of the flip flop of local authority control, why, according to his logic, is it realistic that parents of one generation of pupils can opt out of LEA control yet subsequent generations of parents cannot ever be allowed to opt back in? What is so special about those parents who make such a decision on behalf of all the school's future generation of pupils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are the ones, with the continuing role of governors—one must not ignore governors' crucial responsibility, especially among the key members of the governing body—who may decide. The governors may decide that a ballot is justifiable. Parents may also petition for a ballot, which may go one way or another, and the decision is made. All that will be decided by parents, in full knowledge of the school's circumstances and so on. It makes no sense, under the terms of the amendment, to allow successive parents to ballot at two yearly intervals, with the possibility of schools changing status in and out of grant-maintained status, but not, having left grant-maintained status, being allowed to go into anything else. There may be nothing else for the school to go into—that practical consequence of the amendments is not there. That alone renders the amendment meaningless and unsuccessful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rest my argument not on my previous point, but on the fact that educational sense—not to say common sense and reason—says that such an approach, at best, is mischievous. At worst, it is intended to, rather cleverly—I shall concede that to the hon. Gentleman—undermine the entire basis of the Bill. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his final statement, the Minister let the cat out of the bag. He said that the amendment would undermine the whole basis of the Bill. In other words, if parents of children in grant-maintained schools were given the chance to change their minds, the floodgates would open and they would all want to return to the LEA network. Obviously, the Minister is extremely concerned that
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
those people who will experience grant-maintained status in the future will find it a let down and will be faced with a range of problems. The will wish that they, or their predecessors, had not voted in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister advanced some strange arguments this evening. He talked as if he were a Member of a Government who had never changed their mind. I wonder if the Minister's memory is so short that he does not remember the speeches that he and his colleagues made on the poll tax not that long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He talked about flip flopping from one sector to the other. He does not recognise the obvious fact that once a parent acknowledged the possible mistake that they had made in opting for grant-maintained status, they may not wish to experiment again—they may wish the security of being part of a local framework, with all the strength and assistance that it provides. It is clear that the Minister is afraid of opt-in ballots in grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were consistent he would accept the decision of this miraculous group of parents, composed of just the right people to determine the indefinite future of a school, as being binding if there was a no vote and not allow any provision in legislation for a second ballot the following year or the year after. If one group of parents has all that wisdom, why is there a provision for a opt-out ballot in future years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This evening, I think that the Minister has acknowledged that future parents will be denied for ever any say in the status of the school which their children will attend. He has admitted on other occasions that a minority of parents may decide a school's future. If the parents of final year children ought to be disfranchised on moral terms because their children are leaving, and the 50 per cent. rule is used, clearly a minority of parents could decide a school's future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the amendment's provision cannot be accepted because "our judgment is". In other words, the Government always know best. Only parents who agree with the Government about balloting are in the right. The Minister is nodding to confirm his remarks. He has all the arrogance and certainty of Ministers who pursue their ideological policy regardless of the impact on a school and its future. The Minister is not taking this point seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are grant-maintained schools that are already in difficulties. It is possible that they will find life difficult in future, have underestimated the responsibilities that they have taken on and have underestimated what it means to go it alone. Once a school has gone down a route chosen by the Minister, it would be folly and indefensible on his part to freeze it in a particular status. Ministers are fond of talking about the wisdom of parents, but they obviously do not trust the wisdom of future parents, nor that of parents with experience of grant-maintained status. That is the element of the debate which ought to alarm us most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>947</span>
The Minister is most afraid of parents who will know what it is like to be the parents of a grant-maintained school pupil. The Minister who believes only in choice—if those who do the choosing agree with the Government—has nailed his colours to the mast and exhibited that he will fear democracy once the Bill is enacted. Few schools have opted out. All schools considering going for grant-maintained status would do well to consider the Minister's words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister began by saying that he had looked at the faces of Opposition Members and concluded that they were reasonably serious. He did not have the opportunity to see the faces of his hon. Friends while he was speaking. I did. They were not convinced by his arguments. That is hardly surprising because his arguments were not convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the Minister's arguments about democracy, it is important to discuss the implications of what he said. I would hate it if anyone who read his speech thought that I believe that it is right for parents to be given the right to opt a school out of LEA control. I suspect that I speak for most Opposition Members. Most of us believe in delegating more responsibility and power to schools and parents, but feel that strategic planning should be decided locally by the democratically accountabel LEA. Although the amendment works with the grain of the Bill, it must not be supposed that I support parents having the power to make a school opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I though that we had nailed my next point loudly and clearly, and that the Minister had accepted it. I hope that he will not say again in this Committee that parents have a choice of school for their children. The hon Gentleman withdrew that statement earlier and was prepared to say in future that parents have the opportunity to express a preference. In most parts of the country, parents have no choice whatever. It is sad that the Minister has reverted to using his former phraseology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that he believes it right and proper that a particular group of parents, at a particular time, should without involving the local community—be able to make an important decision which affects a school's entire future. Yet the hon. Gentleman is not willing to give that same power to future generations. Why should one particular group of parents, at a particular time, be able to make a decision that will affect a school for all time—long after their children have left that school? The Minister said that he feared that the possible flip flop of going backwards and forwards will cause, to use a phrase oft heard in this Committee, chaos and—you are even mouthing it, Sir John—confusion. It is interesting that the Minister said in that respect "We take the view that that is what will happen." By emphasising the word "we", as he did, he meant the Tory Government and members of the Conservative party. That is the problem. The Minister says, "We will
	<span class='label label-info column'>948</span>
decide" when it suits his party's dogma. It is only when he knows that the vote may go his way that he is prepared to allow that power to be passed on to the parents and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the problem with Conservative dogma as seen in the Bill. I deplore that one-way-only concept of democracy. That is why I hope that those Conservative Members who looked so surprised and disappointed at the Minister's remarks may still be prepared to stand up for the democratic principles in which I know they believe and support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the hon. Gentleman's remark. I have spoken only about three times during today's proceedings. I have been incredibly restrained. Whatever the disagreements over the previous group of amendments, surely all members of the Committee support those that we are about to discuss. They deal specifically with quality control within grant-maintained schools. I referred earlier to several amendments that I had wished to present to the Committee, but which have dropped because of the guillotine motion. Amendment No. 513 is the one remaining of a sequence of amendments that deal with quality control. Given that my other amendments will not be debated, I hope that the Committee will support Amendment No. 513.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key amendment in the group is Amendment No. 515. It would widen the role of the chief inspector for schools under schedule 15 in a judged way. It identifies specific conditions by which the chief inspector would be expected to press a grant-maintained geverning body to seek advice and assistance. Amendement No. 513 would provide an additional special purposes grant if it were needed, either when Ofsted was involved in promoting the school in order to take advice or when the Secretary of State was involved in replacing governors, which might happen in extreme circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have accepted the possibility that, in some circumstances, a grant-maintained school may get into difficulty. Clauses 56 and 59 provide intervention powers to deal with such a problem. Those powers are triggered when the school is defined as being at risk. The other triggers for intervention measures are less specific that that, such as when
	<br><blockquote><p>"any action taken or proposed by the governing body of the school is prejudicial to the provision of education".</p></blockquote>
Clearly some grant-maintained governing bodies may, at some time, be likely to mismanage their affairs to an extent that justifies intervention. Amendment No. 515 would provide another way in which to deal with the problem. If the inspector's
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
report identifies the possibility that some support for the governing body would be beneficial to the school, and the chief inspector agrees with that report, action can be taken to ensure that advice and help is provided and that grants are made available. The amendments are necessary because Ofsted's role does not cover specifically the inspection of the working of the governing bodies. The amendment would allow inspectors to examine a governing body's work and to make recommendations on advice and support and the availability of funds. Those are simple but important proposals that would provide an additional tier of support to ensure the maintenace of quality in grant-maintained schools. For that reason, they should command the support of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seems eminently sensible and would be a safeguard—unless, of course, Conservative Members take the view that because a school is grant-maintained and reliant upon the funding agencies it will be perfect. We know that not even the Minister, devoted as he is to the concept, kneels each morning, before he eats his breakfast, and at noon and night—to paraphrase the President of the Board of Trade—to pray with sincerity for the completion of his programme. However, to give him his due, he is entirely sincere about what he is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Methinks that perhaps he relies a little too much on intervention by the Deity to make perfect the schools that he is about to create. I caution him this: the good God will not assist him unless he assists himself. The hon. Member for Bath wishes only to assist him, through his amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath has pointed out that there is not automatic perfection in this world. I give an example. This very morning I received a letter from the Secretary of State for Education, no less, about the shortcomings of primary education. I urge those who think that perfection is there at the top and will automatically translate to the schools to remember that we must always be on our guard. You, Sir John, will recall from your school days the phrase 
	<i>quis custodiet ipos custodes.</i> Here we have an example of it. Even the Secretary of State can err. I leave this piece of homework for Conservative Members: there were two mistakes with apostrophes which perhaps they can track down as tonight's homework—or it is possible that one is not a mistake with an apostrophe and the plural of child is really childrens. It is up to them to decide. I shall not go into the appalling construction of some of the grammar because it is not especially germane and you, Sir John, would recall me to order if I pursued it.

I use it simply as an analogy. If even the Secretary of State makes such horrendous errors, is not it true that a grant-maintained school can find itself in difficulties, they will be financial as well as academic. My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury has reminded us of the financial difficulties, and all the hon. Member for Bath is proposing is that inspectors be available for such

	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
emergencies. We need a white knight in the person of the Under-Secretary of State for Schools to come forth and give money so that schools may be properly inspected. I should not like the Minister to think that I am suggesting some kind of snooping; it is not my style to back snooping of any kind. The old idea of Her Majesty's inspectorate—I hope that this will continue into the new method of inspection—was that it should show care and concern for the schools and advise them how to put their house in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, rather than have catastrophe for the beloved grant-maintained school, it would be better for a caring inspector to go in, with the money provided, to ascertain what is wrong, rather than endeavouring himself or herself to correct that, discuss the problem with the head, the governors and the staff to establish how the school might get on the right lines again. Under the Amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Bath, that could be done with some sensitivity. Someone would not bounce in and make huge waves. He or she would go in, carefully examine what is happening, discuss the problem with all those involved and ensure that quietly, and often gradually, matters are put to rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That suggestion is unreasonable. It would be dogma if the Minister said, "No. I shall not accept that." In the same spirit as he spoke to me, I tell him that, deep down, in his heart, he is a man of reason, a man who cares and so even though, like Adam, he may have sinned in bringing forward grant-maintained schools. Nevertheless he cares sufficiently to help to keep them on the right path. Therefore, I hope that he will accept the reasoned and reasonable amendment moved by the hon. Member for Bath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath proposed the amendment not in a spirit of animosity, but in a spirit of helpfullness. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's politics. I do not belong to his political party and—you will be amazed to learn this, Sir John—it is highly unlikely, to put it mildly, that I should ever belong to it. Nevertheless, no matter to what party someone belongs, I recognise when someone is trying to do something for the good of humanity. Therefore, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Bath for all that he has done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that example.

Those reports are useful and the whole community can deliberate on them. In accordance with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>953</span>
Minister's wishes, they mean that parents can consider the schools and can choose properly and sensibly. That is all the hon. Member for Bath asks for in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point about the publication of inspection reports in LEA schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A ballot has taken place in another school in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Halton; perhaps that is why the report on the school that is already grant maintained was not published. It would have provided information to parents in that area that might have convinced them not to vote for grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not impute base motives to the Minister. I cannot think that he would manoeuvre for the late arrival of a report merely in order to win a piddling ballot. If he has done that, I would be very disappointed. I am sure that he will put our fears to rest and declare that he will publish the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. If the Minister stands up to say that he will accept it, I shall sit down and no more will be said. That will be a blessing unto us all. If not, more persuasion will have to be applied. That persuasion is simply expressed. If the Minister wants real success for his concept, he must look to quality control. I employ the phrase used by the hon. Member for Bath advisedly, because Conservative Members like to equate what happens in schools to industry. For example, the Under-Secretary for Further and Higher Education got very hung up about what the word "customer" means. I remind him that the Latin root of that word refers to buying things, and its use implies a preoccupation with filthy lucre, not spiritual values. We must inject into the Bill an idea of perfection, the platonic ideal, in the grant-maintained sector. Plato said that that ideal was a vision in the sky that must be mirrored on earth. To do that with this Bill, we must put in place practices that are desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by saying that there will be considerable problems if the Minister remains hidebound and goes no further in the control of grant-maintained schools the Bill prescribes. In some ways I should be delighted if those problems arose, as I could then say, "We told you so." However, I cannot hope that many thousands of children will have their school careers blighted merely for want of a washer—in this case, that washer would be a person paid by the Department for Education to undertake quality control. Let us have the quality and the perfection in education that we need, rather than the hit-and-miss provision that we have now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments tackle the significant question of how we can ensure quality in the grant-maintained sector. Some of the comments that I shall make could apply as well to LEA schools as to GM schools. A national system of quality assurance should be the bedrock of the education service. Only
	<span class='label label-info column'>954</span>
when such a system is in place will we be able to target the nation's resources to ensure high standards in all our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For one reason or another, not all GM schools will achieve the high standards of quality, examination success and performance that we all want, so there must be a mechanism under which resources can be provided to help schools in difficult circumstances. The amendment challenges the Minister to recognise that action will be required in certain circumstances and to provide a mechanism for that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always a danger in such debates that members of the Committee get hold of a buzz word and think that, if they repeat it often enough, it will assume a mystical meaning. The concept of quality is more prosaic than that and has underpinned our actions in education for some time. What else is the national curriculum about? What else are testing and assessment about? What does the publication of school results involve other than a guarantee of the maximum openness of the system to scrutiny as a contributor to the achievement of quality? I add to that the creation of Ofsted, which will, for the first time, examine impartially the performance of schools. Ultimately, there is the safety net of education associations, which we shall discuss later. All the mechanisms and procedures that we have put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality in our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put that aside for the moment; I mentioned it simply as the context of this debate. I concur with hon. Members' aims and desires, but the amendments are unnecessary because the mechanisms for what they want to achieve exist already. All inspection reports on schools will be available to the Chief Inspector and the Secretary of State. Action plans will be drawn up by governing bodies, which have the responsibility for quality in their schools. Registered inspectors can recommend further inspections if they regard them as desirable to ensure that such quality is achieved. The powers in clauses 56 and 59 have been mentioned already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has rightly referred to those mechanisms that he believes are dealing with quality. My amendment covers specifically the working of the governing body. Is he now saying that the inspection that will take place will consider the working of the governing body, not just through the external output of examination results, but through the day-to-day operation and mechanisms established by that governing body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Inspector would decide whether a formal inspection was necessary. If he thought that it was, he would ensure that it took place. I should be happy to leave that to his judgment. The power to intervene under clauses 56 and 59 is not confined to schools described as at risk and can be invoked in other circumstances. Clause 72 provides already for the making of regulations for the payment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>955</span>
of special purpose grants in the way that the amendment proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no dispute between us on the desirability of the maintenance of quality. Although not drawn together in one place, as the amendment proposes, the Bill makes ample provision for mechanisms to deal with the inspection cycle, the inspection of reports, the responsibility of governors, and the interplay between the governors, the inspectorate and the Secretary of State. Therefore, if those provisions exist, there is no need to repeat them. I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he responded to the amendment. I am grateful also that he has accepted that there is no disagreement between us on the importance of quality control, quality assessment, quality management or whatever else it is called. As the Minister said, although buzz words are used, we know what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read carefully the various parts of the Bill to which the Minister referred. I am not certain that the full impact of the amendment is reflected in the Bill. I spoke only of the ability of the inspector, under present arrangments, to examine specifically the work of the governing body and to include that within his report. The Minister assures me that that is possible. I propose to withdraw the amendment and read in more detail the parts of the Bill referred to by the Minister to assure myself that what he implies is the case. If not, perhaps the Minister and I can talk about the matter further, and consider ways of ensuring that what he and I want will be achieved in the final version of the Bill.

	<div class='title'>CAPITAL GRANTS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment 490, in page 43,line 30, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>', and will include expenditure that may be necessary to improve physical access to the school for people with disabilities'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear in the Bill that capital grants should be used, at least in part, to improve physical access to grant-maintained school buildings. The Special Education Consortium, to which I referred before, and which consists of a wide range of voluntary organisations and charities, is keen that we tackle the problem of access to school buildings for people with disabilities. It is unacceptable today that children with disabilities are denied a place at a local school because of a lack of access, report entitled "Within Reach" was commissioned by the National Union of Teachers and the Spastics Society on the question of access and produced by Coopers and Lybrand, which researched the cost of making education premises accessible to pupils with physical disability or sensory impairment. It was able to estimate the cost of making a primary school or its toilets accessible, but not much hard data was avaialble about the generality of cost of making school buildings accessible to people with physical disabilities or sensory impairment. That is amazing, because the Education Reform Act 1981 should have set in train a vigorous programme of works in schools and colleges to make them accessible to such people. We maintain that there is already a statutory obligation for that work to be done. Part III of the Bill seeks to strengthen the statutory obligation of the 1981 Act, and the amendment would strengthen other statutory obligations of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>957</span>
Adapting a school to make it accessible to a child with a physical disability who wants to attend that school is not the limit of the context of the debate. Many others could benefit from improved access. Teachers, governors, visitors or parents might have physical disabilities and require access to the school. Community use is also in question. General meetings may be held in schools, and many schools fulfil the regular—if not too frequent—and essential function of polling stations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the much lamented general election of April last year, the Spastics Society conducted research into the accessibility of polling stations to disabled people. It found that only 10 per cent. of schools used as polling stations, compared with 12 per cent. of polling stations in general, were accessible. That shows that schools lag behind other polling stations in their accessibility to voters. That research has strengthened the case for the amendment by making clear the need for schools to be made accessible to pupils with physical disabilities or sensory impairment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About £500 million is available to grant-maintained schools for capital grants over the next three years. A significant part of that money should go to make all grant-maintained schools accessible to pupils with physical disabilities or sensory impairment. I must admit that I do not have an idea of how much work across the country would cost, but I am confident that not all the money that has been set aside would be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is already a general duty for schools to be accessible, but all the evidence is of very slow progress towards that goal. Therefore, our minor amendment to clause 73 will provide a service to disabled pupils beyond the few words' space that it takes up on the amendment paper. I hope that the Government will respond positively and sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the motivation behind what the hon. Gentleman has said. I shall say straight away that, as one would expect, nothing in clause 73 would inhibit the use of moneys for the purpose described by the amendment. However, I have to resist the amendment, because I should expect grant-maintained schools to want to work with the funding authority—my Department at the moment and the funding agency for schools in the future—to achieve the objectives outlined by the hon. Gentleman of maximum accessibility to school premises for people with disabilities or sensory impairment. I expect and hope that process in the grant-maintained sector to take place alongside the same process in the LEA sector. I should expect the process to occur without any encouragement in the form of the wording of the amendment. I should expect schools, my Department and the funding agency for schools to want to achieve that process at the same time and in the same way as LEAs are for their schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could argue that many other specifications could be included in the Bill such as compliance with
	<span class='label label-info column'>958</span>
building standards regulations, attention to environmental matters and fire safety. They are important matters for everyone in schools. Although the case advanced by the hon. Member for Bridgend is special—we all acknowledge that—other categories are as important for the welfare of all school pupils or for a particular group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cited various examples, including fire safety. Is he saying that there are schools in England that do not meet fire safety standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course not. If one wanted to use the Bill as a vehicle to specify the desirable and essential things that should be done to school premises, one would have a very long list. That would not be helpful. It is much better to leave the situation as it is in the LEA sector and as it will be in the growing grant-maintained sector, whereby schools and LEAs identify their priorities. The provisions to allow that process to continue are already in the Bill. We should resist the temptation to pick desirable specifications which we all support, and put them in the Bill in the hope that that will make the process occur more quickly. That is not the right way. I hope that if the Committee agrees with me and resists the amendment it will do so in the knowledge that the process will continue thanks to the good will of people in schools, authorities and the DFE. I hope that the Committee will feel safe in resisting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed with the Minister's response. He castigated us for suggesting a lot of special categories of experience and knowledge that people could have to be members of the funding agency and dismissed our amendment on those grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to lay a specific duty on graint-maintained schools concerning improvements to their buildings. School buildings should be accessible to children with physical disabilities or sensory impairment. The Minister's argument that specification is unnecessary because schools already have general responsibilities for such activity runs in the face of a number of developments in education. The Education Act 1944 states that LEAs must provide suitable education for all children of whatever age, aptitude and ability. That could be taken to mean that LEAs have the duty to make proper provision for children with special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, over the years consensus has increased that there should be a more specific provision to ensure that pupils with special needs are catered for more successfully. The amendment would make grant-maintained schools more accessible to children with special needs. I had hoped that the Minister would accept it in the spirit of the Education Reform Act 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III tries to clarify and strengthen provisions that cover, for example, statementing in the 1981 Act. I am unhappy with the Minister's response. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>959</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the lateness of the hour. The next six clauses refer specifically to funding grant-maintained schools in Wales before the schools funding council is set up. Clause 76 is an enabling clause, and this clause stand past debate will give us the opportunity to ask the Minister of State, Welsh Office how grants will apply in the Principality. The existence of grant-maintained schools in Wales will fundamentally change the system. How will current revenue and capital funding for LEAs and grant-maintained schools be affected by the measure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local education authorities in Wales are cutting millions of pounds. The importance of allocating resources where they are needed, and not just to grant-maintained schools, irrespective of need, should be upheld. The valleys of south Wales are
	<span class='label label-info column'>960</span>
some of the most deprived parts of Wales. Significant cuts have been suggested in the education budgets of two LEAs in the valleys: Gwent, which is my county and Mid Glamorgan, which is that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that nearly £3 million should be cut from the education budget in Gwent and a similar amount in Mid Glamorgan. That would involve reductions in support for the Welsh language, for music, meal subsidies, maintenance awards for further education students, discretionary awards and, in general, in the way in which Welsh schools are maintained and repaired.

The local education authority in Gwent has increased charges for school meals, not filled vacancies in the educational psychology service, restructured the education welfare service and education support services, reduced library services and central support services for home group tuition and the maintenance of schools, reduced the precept paid to the Welsh joint education committee, and so on. All those cuts are replicated in every local education authority throughout Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background we must consider how the Minister responsible for education in Wales will allocate grant to grant-maintained schools. At present there are only three such schools, but one or two others have agreed to opt out. What will happen, for example, in the case of Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, to which I referred earlier? Will the Minister agree to that school becoming grant maintained simply to improve maintenance or to provide a new school? Will he agree to such requests simply to increase the number of grant maintained schools in the Principality?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inadequate though the system of grant distribution and SSA is, money has so far been allocated on the basis of fairness and need. Those are both important criteria. What guarantee is there that they will continue to operate? Will our LEA schools be disadvantaged, while those that apply for grant-maintained status receive an unfair advantage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will tell us that LEAs in Wales have underspent on capital provision. That is what he said on Second Reading and on television recently when he and I debated the matter. However, the position is not as simple as that. The Government overestimated the amount of money that LEAs would receive by way of capital receipts. The recession has been worse than they anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister knows that LEAs in Wales are part of a county council system, and because of local priorities, services vie for funds. The notional amount that the Welsh Office says that our LEAs have to spend on education can be spent on social services, the fire service or the police, all of which are extremely important in their own way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Minister knows that because of the restrictions that his Department is imposing for the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
first time on LEAs by way of capping the council tax next year, any revenue implications from capital spending must be examined in great detail by LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will reply at greater length than the Under-Secretary of State for schools, who merely said "yes", "no" and so on. Will he ensure that the system of distribution of grant to LEAs will be fair and based on need? Will our LEA schools be disadvantaged? Will grant-maintained schools be given extra assistance for political ends? Will he consider schools such as Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni and give them not only new maintenance grants but, if necessary, new schools? We look forward with great interest to his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for returning to the question of revenue allocation. He told the annual story of local authorities complaining that their revenue settlements are inadequate and that cuts will have to be made. Those cuts are always in education or some other area that is a sore point with the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) made it clear that he knows that there will be an increase in next year's revenue settlement in Wales of 3.1 per cent. That money is not allocated in Wales specifically for education, social or other services. It is up to individual authorities to decide how much to spend on education services. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the prospect of cuts in Gwent and Mid Glamorgan, but those LEAs must negotiate with their counties about how much money they are allocated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene so early, but I fear that the Minister of State has misunderstood me. When I referred to virement, I was referring to capital spending. Such virement cannot take place in revenue spending because the bulk of county council expenditure goes on education. Cuts of £14 million in Clwyd and £12 million in Gwent, for instance, must be made mostly in education spending, because that is the main service provided by county councils in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are other services, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Separate authorities in Wales do not have SSAs for education. The SSA for education is set for Wales as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen has reminded me that there has been a capital underspend on schools by the Welsh local authorities over the past two or three years. That underspend was quite significant last year, being of the order of at least 15 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that there is a correlation between capital underspending and the introduction of the strict capping regime on local government spending? Local authorities face the problem that the debt charge to service capital borrowing must be funded from revenue. As the revenue spending is capped, local authorities can no longer borrow the capital because they cannot afford the revenue consequences of doing so. Local
	<span class='label label-info column'>962</span>
authorities have no wish to underspend, but the strict revenue controls as a result of capping give them no choice—they cannot use their capital borrowing powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect what the hon. Gentleman says, but local authorities in Wales have spent less, in terms of capital, on education than the Welsh Office expected. I do not believe that the Welsh Office would anticipate that a local authority would exceed capital spending in a way that inevitably would result in capping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not need to continue to discuss that point. People in Wales, in the LEAs and elsewhere, will read what we have said in 
	<i>Hansard.</i> The hon. Gentleman knows that, in the current year, there will be an excess of some 10 per cent. in capital spending on education, social services and transport, taken together. The point, surely, is that because the local authorities are also local social services authorities, they have to modernise homes for the elderly. That is their priority, because of care in the community. The shift in capital spending is to social services, because that is the priority in local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny what the hon. Gentleman said. I merely state that there has been a capital underspend by local authorities in Wales on schools and colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen asked me about the clauses subsequent to the rather technical clause 76 and how the grants would affect overall education expenditure in Wales. He will know that the moneys that the grant-maintained schools will get from annual maintenance grant, special purposes grant and capital grant is money that those schools would have had, one way or another, had they remained in the local authority sector. The essential difference between a grant-maintained and a local authority-maintained school is that the grant-maintained school gets its money direct from the Secretary of State and the Welsh Office at present. When sufficient grant-maintained schools have been established, they will get their moneys through the schools funding council for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the co-existence of local authorities and grant-maintained schools. Progress has been made in establishing grant-maintained schools, which are proving a popular concept with parents. There are various schools in Wales in which the matter is currently being considered. At the time of our earlier sitting today, Stanwell school in South Glamorgan decided by ballot that it wanted to seek grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni. I have visited the school and it is true that a great deal needs to be done. My officials have made it clear to the school that there is no question of any commitment by the Welsh Office to capital grant of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>963</span>
any kind for the school, prior to it taking a decision to become grant maintained and securing the necessary parental support by ballot, and the approval of the Secretary of State to the application. Only then can we consider the school's needs. There is no question that it has needs, but that is also true of many other schools in Wales in the local authority and grant maintained sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's further explanation may partly have answered my question. He implied that once the school had become grant maintained, the Welsh Office would be able to consider the needs of the school, with particular regard to capital for new buildings and so on, as though the only way of getting the money was to vote to become grant maintained. Then, their needs would 'be considered by the Welsh Office and, by implication, would be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister continued to say that the Welsh Office's desire to meet their needs would be cash limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said, in specific reference to Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, to which the hon. Member for Torfaen twice referred, that its bid for the capital could not be considered until the Secretary of State approved any application that it might make. As far as I am aware, it has not taken more than preliminary steps to consider grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting point, not because it has been previously discussed in the House, but because the letter that the governing body circulated to all parents takes a novel approach to GM status. It does not discuss maintenance or repairs, but states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are totally opposed to seeking GM status within the present buildings. And so are the staff. We will arrange a ballot … provided that we are certain that we will get a new school."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>964</span>
How does that fit in with the new scene? Does it mean that if such a run-down school is given grant-maintained status by the Welsh Office, so a totally new school will be built on the existing site, or on another site?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that such a suggestion does not fit in with the procedure. No bid for capital can be entertained until a school is fully established as a grant-maintained school. Among the schools that have already achieved grant-maintained status in Wales, some have had capital needs, and have made bids, and, in certain cases, such bids have been argreed to. Money will be supplied directly from the Welsh Office to help meet their needs, as is the procedure when a school has gained grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of our schools will enjoy grant-maintained status—of that I have no doubt at all. Furthermore, let me take advantage of this opportunity to say that grant-maintained status will not have an adverse effect on Welsh-medium education. We have so provided that the grant-maintained sector will contribute to the development of Welsh-medium education, just as the LEA sector has done in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
