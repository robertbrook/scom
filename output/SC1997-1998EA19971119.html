	<div class='legislation'>Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: Controls on Cattle, Sheep and Goats</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>
	<i>Relevant document: [European Community Document No. 12559/96, on the exclusion from human food and animal feed of specified risk material as regards transmissible spongiform encephalopathies</i>.]</p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of the opportunity to discuss with the Committee the controls on specified material from cattle, sheep and goats. They were adopted by the Commission on 30 July as Commission decision 97/534/EC, which comes into force on 1 January 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar proposal was rejected by the Agriculture Council in December 1996. Since then, following inspections to check the implementation of Community measures on bovine spongiform encephalopathy in member states—other than the United Kingdom and Portugal—the Commission concluded that no member state could be considered free from the potential risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. We drew that report to the attention of our experts on the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, who advised that existing United Kingdom controls on specified material from cattle should be extended to imports. SEAC also recommended that United Kingdom controls on sheep and goat material should include the spinal cord and the spleen, in addition to the current controls on heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced in the summer that unless the resurrected Commission proposal was adopted, we in the United Kingdom would introduce unilateral controls on imports in line with SEAC's advice. That was not an attempt to introduce by the back door a ban on imported beef, but to ensure for the British public that the same controls were applied to imported beef wherever it came from as were applied to home-produced beef.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now turn to the decision. It defines specified risk material—or SRM—and prohibits its use for any purpose. It also prohibits the use of the vertebral column of cattle, sheep and goats for the production of mechanically recovered meat. When removed from the carcase, the SRM is to be stained and disposed of by controlled methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision also prohibits the import of SRM into the Community and requires imports of products of animal origin intended for food, animal feed or
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
medical, pharmaceutical or cosmetic products to be accompanied by a declaration that they do not contain, and are not derived from, specified risk material. At present, there are no derogations for any third country from those requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We received notice this morning by fax that the Commission has tabled an amendment to the decision on the cosmetics and pharmaceutical aspect for discussion in its Standing Veterinary Committee. The matter needs careful study and I shall submit a memorandum about the amendment to the Select Committee on European Legislation when it has been examined fully. As the situation is changing as I am talking, it is difficult for me to be accountable at present to the Committee for such a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to the practical effect of the decision for this country. As a result of the order, there will be no change to the controls on cattle. All our checks are in place and are being policed rigorously and, since May, we have taken many steps to improve the situation. We are committed specifically to maintaining our existing controls over animals slaughtered in the United Kingdom when they go further than the controls in the European Union. We have used the precautionary principle and have gone further than is required, which we are allowed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation for sheep and goats is different. The decision requires us to extend our existing controls on the heads of sheep and goats to include the spleen of all sheep and goats, and the tonsils and spinal cord of sheep and goats aged over 12 months—commonly known as mutton—or those that have a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum. That, of course, is in line with what the SEAC experts said we must do. That good, independent, scientific advice was made known in the summer and we have followed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed about the difficulties of removing spinal cord from sheep without damaging the meat or slowing down the slaughter line. As a former production engineer in manufacturing industry, I am well aware of the problems of slowing down production lines, which is usually done to improve the quality of the product. However, we acknowledge that it is not easy to remove the spinal cord from sheep, which is why we asked Bristol university and the Meat and Livestock Commission to undertake trials on methods of removing spinal cord. SEAC took those results into account when advising the Government, and copies of that research were made available to the industry. We recently completed consultation on implementing those controls in Great Britain. Needless to say, when introducing legislation, we shall take fully into account what has been said, including what hon. Members say today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Meat Hygiene, Service's enforcement of the existing SRM controls in licensed slaughterhouses costs the taxpayer about £18 million a year. When the extra controls on sheep and goats are introduced, the cost will rise by about £26 million a year. The Government have concluded that the cost can no longer be borne by the taxpayer. We therefore propose that from the start of the next financial year, the cost should be recouped from the industry, as is currently
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
done in respect of Meat Hygiene Service inspections. To that end, we shall soon be consulting on draft legislation. It will be genuine consultation, taking note of the industry's concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom's main worry in adopting the Commission's decision has been about its effect on the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. We might have had an interesting discussion about that, but we cannot because it is yet another moving target in Brussels. However, I understand the difficulties, which is one of the reasons why it is being looked at again. Not only the UK is affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It came to public attention just before the summer recess that the previous Government had failed to legislate for the beef ban as required. That left us withoug the legal power to take action against the spivs and smugglers who give the industry a bad name; we could not even check lorries at ports. That was rectified on 1 August. The recent EC action against the UK was not over standards in our slaughterhouses, but over failure to enforce the ban. I make that clear because of previous mischievous press reporting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have until 11.30 am at the latest for questions to the Minister. I remind Members that questions should be brief and should be asked one at a time. There is likely to be ample opportunity for all Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time in this Committee that I have seen the Minister of State in charge. I have no doubt that we shall have a most interesting and stimulating debate on what, to many people, is a difficult subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare an interest. Before becoming a Member of Parliament, I was a butcher and farmer. I still have some interest in the meat and livestock industry, although I hasten to add that the abattoir that belongs to my family company no longer slaughters cattle and sheep. We gave that up eight or 10 years ago because it became politically too difficult to make money out of those two commodities. Our ceasing to be involved in that business has nothing at all to do with the subject under discussion today. In putting his case this morning, the Minister covered most of the ground—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would like the hon. Gentleman to remember that this is Question Time. I now listen for a brief, succinct question to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming absolutely directly to the question, Mr. Jones. Is the Minister satisfied that in drafting legislation, Ministers are not only taking the best advice available, but querying in depth and in detail the quality of that advice? If I may refer to the 10th report of the Select Committee on European Legislation, which referred to a letter written by his predecessor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying to help the hon. Gentleman. A question please, straight to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will ask a direct question. Is the Minister satisfied that he is receiving good, sound advice? Alternatively, is the Committee to understand that every time SEAC changes its mind on the issue, the Government will automatically change their position and adopt SEAC's new recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his introductory remarks. We should declare an interest; we are each other's pairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The brief answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is, by and large, yes. If SEAC receives further evidence which causes it to change its advice, the Government will, by and large, accept its independent advice. Nothing is laid down in tablets of stone. The fact that in recent years, many decisions on BSE were either not taken or changed is evidence of that. The answer to the hon. Gentleman's unspoken question—do we simply accept without question all the advice that we receive?—is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the election campaign, I visited one of the principal abattoirs dealing with the cull of cattle in Scotland, which is in my constituency. The increase in capacity and the capital investment in the destruction of livestock at that abattoir was almost mesmerising. What is the Minister's view of the implications of the directive for the abattoir industry? Does he believe that the private sector has the capacity to handle the proposals and guarantee safety in the way that he wants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact that we kill many animals each year. I know that the hon. Gentleman is a Scottish Member, but my notes contain only figures for England and Wales. However, in 1996, 2.3 million cattle and calves and 18 million sheep were killed. That position will not change, although the figures depend on the season. I am not sure how many pigs are killed each year; they are not the subject of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the directive, 18 million sheep must be checked and, if they are over 12 months old, their spinal cords must be removed. Therefore, all the lamb that people buy in butchers' shops and supermarkets is not affected. Generally, sheep are killed before they are a year old, so the extra capacity required in abattoirs is that which the Meat Hygiene Service must put in place to check that sheep older than 12 months—those whose incisors are through the gum—have their spinal cords removed. We understand that it is not easy to check that the spinal cord has been removed because of the tools that are necessary. The issue is not the size of the killing machine—to use what might be thought of as crude language; after all, that is what we are talking about—but the checks that will occur within that machine as a result of the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reverting to my earlier question, the Minister will agree that last year, SEAC advised his predecessor that no unilateral action should be taken on this front and that this May, SEAC advised that the Government should act unilaterally if agreement at Community level was not forthcoming quickly. That is a complete contradiction. The Minister must explain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
why he believes that there are sufficient grounds to change the approach now, given that in the explanatory memorandum, we are reminded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A link has not yet been proven between V-CJD in the UK and the effect of exposure to the BSE agent."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: SEAC changed its advice but, as I reminded the Committee in my opening remarks, when the European Commission recommended the change in 1995, its proposal was rejected. The issue of removing spinal cords from sheep and goats has not just popped up. It has been on the agenda in Europe for some time and the French have been removing such matter since last summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No sheep are known to have caught bovine spongiform encephalopathy except in laboratory conditions when they were deliberately infected. We are operating on the precautionary principle, however, and I believe that that is right. The safety of the food chain is paramount. Rebuilding consumer confidence in the food supply is one of the Government's top priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SEAC thought more about the issue when it was raised in Europe. We wanted to put beef from abroad through the same checks as beef from this country. SEAC agreed and gave the Government that advice, which the Government were right to accept. I believe that the previous Government would also have accepted that advice this summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer the Minister to the answers that he gave me earlier this year on the incidence of BSE in cattle? The peak was five years ago and the incidence has now fallen to a very low level. His colleague in the Department of Health told me that the peak for CJD was in 1994, when there were 59 cases, and that in 1997 to July, there were only 12 cases. The incidence of the disease in animals has fallen dramatically and is much reduced in humans. Are not the Government overreacting? Are not we shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact that the incidence of BSE in cattle has reduced dramatically since the feed system was changed some years ago. The 1997 figures to 7th November show that 2,817 cattle in Great Britain and 19 in Northern Ireland have been infected—that is fewer than 100 a week. At the peak of the BSE crisis, 1,000 cattle a week were found to be infected. That is a dramatic reduction. The incidence is 40 per cent. down on last year and last year it was 40 per cent. down on the year before, when it was 30 per cent. down on the previous year. It is estimated from epidemiological studies that the disease will be eradicated by 2001. Nevertheless, we are right to continue to take precautions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ban still has not been lifted. It was supposed to be lifted last November thanks to the negotiating skills of the former Prime Minister, but the matter has been left to this Government. We have yet to convince our partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would be a fool to deny that politics as well as science is involved, but the advice that we were given on controls on sheep—further to those on sheep's heads—applies to only a small proportion of the 18
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
million sheep. It applies to about 2·5 million sheep slaughtered over the age of 12 months, of which it is estimated that three quarters are for the halal meat market with most of the rest going to the Scottish meat pie industry. It is perfectly safe food, but we want to operate on a precautionary principle and remove the spinal cord and other risk materials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that given the sorry history of the past 15 years, it is appropriate that the Government err on the side of caution? What representations has his Department received from the producers? Do they too believe that the cautious approach is best?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the case. May I first respond further to what the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) said? The figures that he quoted for CJD may be true, but they are not relevant. The relevant ones are for new CJD, which is not falling. There are 22 cases of new CJD, some of which are unexplained. One person was a vegetarian for 10 years and the disease is predominant among young people, which is not the case with what I call ordinary CJD. Heaven forbid that the figure increases further; in November 1997, we have not reached the stage when we can be absolutely certain that there will not be further cases. Every week and month that goes by without a new case, however, is really good news both for public health and consumer confidence in our meat industry. We must take precautions because at present, we cannot be certain. Anyone who says he is sure is telling a porky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We consulted widely on the memorandum that the Committee received and I have lost count of the number of organisations that were consulted on the proposed order. We had many responses, which were seriously taken into account. There are several that openly welcome our proposals on public health and consumer confidence grounds. The fact that there are some practical problems has been highlighted, of course. Nobody denies that and there will be further problems for the industry because of my announcement in my opening speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his welcome comments on the Scottish diet. He mentioned the research that has been carried out at Bristol university on the removal of spinal cord and the fact that it has been the practice in France for 12 months. Will he give us an update on the lessons that have been learnt from the French experience and the state of the research at Bristol university?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish I could because I have asked that question. I understand that the controls in France are not applied in the way in which we propose to apply them. The removal is left to the butcher in the butcher's shop. In this country, the removal of the nasty bits, as it were, from cattle, sheep and goats is done in the licensed slaughterhouse, which was regarded as the best place by the previous Government and by this Government, so that is what will happen with sheep. That is slightly different from France. We have been unable to find out much about the practicalities of how the French do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The process is done with some difficulty on a minority of sheep. There have been experiments using different cutting tools to remove the spinal column. In some cases, the tool requires taking out the vertebrae completely, which destroys the way in which the sheep carcase can be hung in the butcher's shop. I understand the problems, and accept that splitting sheep is not as easy as splitting cattle. I freely admit that I have not yet seen the splitting of sheep, although I have seen the splitting of cattle on a large scale. Therefore, I am aware of the difficulties in dealing with a much smaller animal to ensure that all the specified risk material is removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research continues and there have been trials in some of the cutting plants. We hope that the equipment will be available early in 1998, but it certainly will not be available on 1 January when the order comes into force. Normal methods will continue, which will make for difficulties in the slaughterhouses and will probably require slowing of the lines. The spinal cord can be removed, but we want the tools to do it without necessarily causing disruption to the speed of the slaughter line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told the Committee that the Government will do everything that they can to recover consumer confidence, and I do not doubt his bona fide on that. Will he consider the fact that introducing further additional regulations and restrictions affecting the product at a time when the incidence of disease both in animals and humans is decreasing, will be counter-productive? People will say, "You tell us that the incidence of the disease is falling so why are you bringing in additional regulations?" The public will ask that question, rather than concentrate on what I know are the Minister's best intentions to do what he can to improve public confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are bringing in no new controls and making no changes whatsoever affecting cattle. All the new controls are to be in addition to the order concerning the heads of sheep and goats which was introduced by the previous Government and involve taking out some more parts of the very old sheep—those aged over 12 months, which are a minority, comprising 2.5 million out of about 18 million. The only new controls will be those on older sheep. They will not be onerous, but they will be disruptive simply because of the need to check the state of the animal to ensure that none of the older ones goes through the chain with the younger ones. The changes will not affect lamb, whether spring lamb or quality lamb. However, there will be more checks in the slaughterhouses, which can only be good for public confidence whether or not the incidence of BSE is falling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the impression—my hon. Friend the Minister has just given half the answer to this—that the order is not about BSE in cattle, but about the matters that he has already stressed. Can he comment on what has been alleged by Opposition Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
that there is evidence that the incidence of CJD in human beings is diminishing? It seems to me that there is no evidence of that whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat what I said before concerning the incidence of new CJD, which involves a prion analogous to that in BSE. I am speaking from memory now, but I think that so far, 22 people have died. That is an absolutely tragic loss for the families concerned which need never have happened. We hope that that figure does not get any higher, but we cannot say that the incidence is diminishing. New CJD is happening to people who have not been susceptible to what I will call normal CJD, which has tended to affect much older members of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow about the Minister. Although we have faced each other across the Floor of the House, this is the first of what I expect will be a number of occasions when we do so across a Committee Room. While the Minister may share the privilege of pairing arrangements with my hon. Friend, he also has the great privilege of having my former driver, whom I sorely miss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of questions to ask the Minister, but I will follow your injunction, Mr. Jones, and ask them one at a time. Having read through vast amounts of paper, I am slightly puzzled by the choice of the 12-month age for sheep. It appears that SEAC originally advised the former Government to choose a six-month age—anyone who knows about these things knows that that age cannot be assessed. The age was then changed to 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the age of 12 months been selected because it is genuinely believed that below that age, specified offal other than spleen is safe, or because that is the earliest age of carcase from which it is possible to remove the spinal cord?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of these issues are extremely technical. To the best of my knowledge, in the experiments involving deliberately infecting sheep with BSE in laboratory conditions—because that has not occurred in nature—the earliest age at which a sheep was infected was 27 months. The point about 12 months is that the incisor can be checked at that age. To the best of my knowledge, we have not received advice concerning six months; 12 months was chosen as a precaution because the first incisor could be checked then, and because it was well below the age at which the laboratory experiment caused BSE in sheep. Choosing that age made us safer on both avenues. Unlike cattle, of course, sheep are not tagged from birth with an identifying number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that response. I now turn to the issue of slaughterhouses. The Minister has rightly reminded the Committee that the bulk of animals slaughtered when they are over 12 months old are for the halal market and that they represent a small proportion of all sheep killed. Nevertheless, the Minister said earlier that about 250,000 carcases were from younger animals at the end of the lambing season. Indeed, because the one-tooth eruption can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
take place as early as 10 months, that figure could be significantly higher. Will the Minister explain why he proposes in the draft statutory instrument to limit the number of premises licensed to remove the spinal column—in other words, those that can handle sheep over 12 months old? We should bear in mind the fact that, despite the recent shake-up, countless small abattoirs kill for local needs, including the small amounts needed to manufacture mutton pies and so on. I see no logic limiting the number of slaughterhouses able to do that work; what matters is that they should do it competently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that question, because it is the easiest to answer. We no longer propose to limit the number of slaughterhouses. They must be competent to do the job, well equipped, and licensed by the Meat Hygiene Service. The original idea was to limit the number, rather as the over-30-months scheme would have done, but that is no longer possible because of my announcement about recovering the Meat Hygiene Service's costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow, I welcome the Minister as a fellow west midlander. I also declare an interest. I come from a farming family and have close relatives who raise cattle for beef. My career was in the tanning industry, and I retain an active interest in it. My question is simple. How many people died last year of E. coli poisoning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good question. I am aware of the 22 or 23 who died in Scotland, but I am not aware of any in England. If there were any, I shall tell the hon. Gentleman later or write to him. To the best of my knowledge, E. coli poisoning is not mentioned in the document before us today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will confirm that. The Minister has said enough on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question about compliance costs, which the Minister mentioned in his introductory remarks. When does he propose to legislate to pass the responsibility for compliance costs on to the industry? Does he believe that passing those costs exclusively to the industry is compatible with his legitimate desire to guarantee public confidence in the processes being undertaken?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The recovery of those costs from industry will commence in April—from the beginning of the next financial year. I could say, without gloating, that the first three months are free. A safe food policy is in everyones's interest. The taxpayer, through the enforcement procedures of local authorities and central Government, pays the vast bulk of that money. It is true that the Meat Hygiene Service recovers a good part of its costs. That is important for the security of the food chain, because of the continuing cost of ensuring the removal of specified risk materials. The industry itself has a role to play. It is in the industry's best interests that controls should be in a place, that the costs should be shared fairly and that the industry
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
should contribute towards the costs of enforcement controls. None of that undermines the rebuilding of consumer confidence in the safety of the food chain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Caution is extremely important. Does the Minister agree that the original Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—it is associated with 1,800 potential deaths—has an incubation period of 20 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the incubation period is. We know that the incubation period for BSE is long, and that for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease could be as long as my hon. Friend suggests. That is one reason why we cannot be absolutely certain about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that changing the cattle feed has vastly reduced the incidence of BSE, as the figures that I cited show. When I came to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I asked what the cause of BSE was, but one cannot get a straight answer. One is told, "We changed the feed and the incidence fell". That is not the answer to the question, but it is a fact that the incidence is vastly reduced. All the signs lead us to expect a further reduction of 40 per cent. next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incubation periods for the diseases are known to run for many years. As I said, one of the people who, tragically, died from new CJD had been a vegetarian for the past 10 years; there must be an explanation for that. The matter causes worry, but at the moment the numbers are low. The incidence has not exploded as some people predicted a year ago, saying that there would be thousands of cases in the early months. We are taking every possible step to ensure that that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the long incubation period, we are right to take precautions. That costs money, but in the long run it will be cheaper in pounds, shillings and pence and will enhance the quality of life of most of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I direct the Minister's attention to disposal? He refers to incineration and landfill of protein and other material after the rendering process. We are discussing the application of the measures throughout Europe, not just in the United Kingdom, where there is already a problem with the disposal of the over-30-months scheme cattle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What action are the Government taking to ensure that there will be sufficient incineration capacity in the United Kingdom to deal with the extra volume? Is the Minister certain that the landfill facilities are so safe that there will be no future risk? We accept that the risk is minimal but, as he rightly says, we must be precautionary. What information does he have about the arrangements in Europe for the disposal of the specified offals that will be removed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have not misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's question, but there is not a huge new problem in finding incineraton or landfill capacity for offal. The spinal cords of sheep over 12 months—some 2.5 million—and the spleen from all sheep will be removed and destroyed under controlled conditions, which I think will be the same in any event, and will consist of incineration or rendering down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
That is not what we are discussing, however. We will not, as a result of the order, have to build a mountain of meat and bonemeal as we had to under the over-30months scheme. We are killing perfectly healthy cattle over 30 months and rendering them down. Currently, there are almost 300,000 tonnes of meat and bonemeal and 100,000 tonnes of tallow from the over-30-months scheme stored around the country. The amount is being added to every week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that has to be destroyed, and the Government are actively considering the best way of doing so. No decisions have been taken on whether landfill is an option, whether we should use incineration, recovering the power through burning, or whether the tallow can be used for fuel. There has been no BSE carcase landfill since 1991. We published details of all the sites when we came into office in May, and the Environment Agency has checked them all—there is no threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will not lead to a huge new mountain of rendered meat and bonemeal. The sheep are okay; they are perfectly healthy and will go through the slaughterhouse with the health mark. All we are doing is removing the spleen from all sheep and the spinal cord from older sheep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read the comment from the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers in the feed-back paper to the consultation document. It wanted assurances that the European Union-wide implementation of the directive would be monitored to ensure that United Kingdom producers were not disadvantaged. What assurances can the Minister give the industry about the decision's implementation, given that the United Kingdom is not as enthusiastic about it as other European Union countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are good members of the European Union. The hon. Gentleman's question has given me the opportunity to correct my earlier answer when I said that nothing in the measure would affect cattle. The decision will not affect cattle in this country, but it will affect other cattle throughout Europe; they will have to go through the same process as our cattle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inspectors from the European Union visit other countries. They do not simply slip across the channel and pick on the United Kingdom. I cannot sustain the argument that we are the only members of the European Union who play cricket—although I might have used it in the past—and I can give the hon. Gentleman an example why, although it is not a very good one. The British were caught red-handed in the summer by EU inspectors who visited cutting plants and cold stores and found a small number of the spivs who give the industry a bad name, removing health marks and forging labels. As a result, we closed down two plants immediately. The action received massive publicity throughout Europe; it put the British in the dock and made it seem that we do not care about food safety; although we are taking incredibly rigorous
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
steps to ensure that we carry out the appropriate action. We have to rely on the European Union's enforcing its own rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No changes will affect cattle under the order but, as a consequence of the European Union decision, all cattle in Europe will be treated the same. They will be subject to the same standards governing the removal of risk materials as those to which we are subject in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Minister to the Committee. I cannot declare an interest in the subject, other than that I represent the constituency of Mid-Norfolk where, as well as many consumers, there are many interest groups concerned with the food industry. I appreciate that the Minister received information by fax about the matter only this morning, but my question relates to pharmaceuticals. I understand that the Commission wants products that might contain damaging material removed from our shelves by 1 January 1998. Will the Minister say whether that will happen? If not, what impact will the matter have on consumer confidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely cannot answer that question properly. If I tried to do so, I would simply be waffling. I do not wish to mislead the Committee. I do not know the answer because discussions are taking place in Brussels at present on how to get out of the situation created by imprecise wording about what should happen to pharmaceuticals. When Brussels has reached agreement and made a decision, we shall come back to the House and inform hon. Members. The industry has every right to be concerned about the matter. Its worries have been expressed, as what was proposed was causing problems because of impracticality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now expand the answer that I gave to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). Part of the order relates to the compulsory slaughter of sheep with scrapie. The number of sheep with scrapie destroyed in this country is about 400 or 500 a year. The slaughter will be carried out at the veterinary investigation centres. Farmers will not have to carry it out. They will receive compensation, as happens at present. Under our system, the compensation scheme encourages farmers not to hide scrapie in sheep. We do not believe that thousands or hundreds of thousands of cases remain unreported; there is an incentive to report them. Again, that will not create a problem with incineration or landfill capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister name any abattoir that has removed the spines from sheep in commercial quantities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue that line, as my hon. Friend and Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) has just raised the issue? The Minister proposes that the draft statutory instrument should state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person shall remove the spinal cord or any part of it from the vertebral column of a sheep or goat in which there was at least one permanent incisor erupted, except.…in an authorised slaughterhouse or at authorised cutting premises by.…
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
longitudinaly splitting the whole vertebral column or removing a longitudinal section of the whole vertebral column containing the spinal cord".</p></blockquote>
As was implicit in my hon. Friend's question—indeed, the Minister has made it clear too—there are huge technical problems in carrying out such procedures. I have studied the Bristol report which states that the only way forward is by splitting the whole vertebral column. Nevertheless, work is being undertaken on several other techniques, including vacuum suction combined with the use of steam. Perhaps other techniques will be developed. Why does the Minister consider it necessary to prescribe in the draft statutory instrument how the spinal cord should be removed, as that would either prevent the development of other more satisfactory methods, perhaps involving fewer problems with production lines, or mean that he must to return to the House to alter the statutory instrument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rather do that than leave the matter open now. The French have used a vacuum suction technique, but we have not been able to find much information about its practicalities and results. Another method involved cutting straight across the carcase rather than longitudinally, but the risk that part of the material would be splashed on to the rest of the carcase are so great that the longitudinal method is thought to be best. All kinds of tools are being considered, including saws to cut down the spinal column and remove it while leaving the carcase intact. As I have said, splitting carcasses would present butchers with practical problems. For example, it would mean the end of the Barnsley chop, which would be sad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must reconsider some of my answers. We do not pay compensation for scrapie—I have not made an announcment this morning. We have consulted on that proposal, but it has not been implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson), the decision on pharmaceuticals is intended to avoid immediate shelf clearance. We do not want problems in chemists' shops. The products exist and are perfectly safe. Such decisions are taken to avoid problems with the practicalities. I regret that everything is being done at the last minute in Brussels, but we are not responsible for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend's life improve if the nation went vegetarian?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A few weeks ago, I opened a vegetarian food fair at the national exhibition centre. The producers of vegetarian products represent a small but thriving part of our food industry, and include many small companies with turnovers of £5 million to £6 million, many of which are family businesses. Vegetarianism is increasing in this country; it is not illegal. I am responsible for food safety throughout the food chain. I am not the Minister for red meat or white meat, but for food safety. People are entitled to have a free and informed choice of the products that they eat. I cannot be more specific than that—and I declare an interest in that I am not a vegetarian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that BSE was caused by contaminated food being fed to animals? As such food has been removed, obviously the number of cases has fallen. If BSE in sheep is also caused by contaminated food, surely it is extremely unlikely that there ever will be a case of BSE now that they are no longer fed contaminated food. Therefore, is not the order going completely over the top?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some people may say that. I plead not guilty to going over the top, but guilty to taking the most practical precautions on food safety that we can, based on the best scientific advice available. I make no apology for that, but the premise of the hon. Gentleman's question is one that I have already knocked on the head by being the devil's advocate. No one can say for certain that contaminated food was the cause. But we can certainly say that getting rid of that food has vastly reduced the incidence of the disease and, indeed, will lead to its wipe-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can argue that bonemeal is not being fed to any animal as it has been banned. There has been a lot of pressure from the poultry industry to go back to feeding bonemeal, but we are not prepared to take any risks whatever. We are being cautious, but the order is not going over the top. There have been no incidents of BSE in sheep, and it is extremely unlikely that they will get it. However, we believe that the parts of the sheep that might cause a problem, if such a problem arose, should be removed from older sheep—those that are more than 12 months old. The measure will not include lambs that are sold in butchers' shops and supermarkets, which are perfectly safe and not affected at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SEAC has considered the issue. There have been arguments about maternal transmission, mites and so on transferring diseases around the animal kingdom. We are taking precautions and believe that we are right to do so. It is in the industry's interests, too, and not just a matter of public health and consumer confidence. I sometimes think that in the industry's quieter moments, it thinks that such precautions could have been taken in 1981 and 1982, instead of the issue being sat on by the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final issue on which I want to press the Minister has already raised its head. I want to know what is going on in the rest of Europe and to ensure that any food that we import is safe. I am the first to accept that the amount of sheepmeat and beef imported from Europe is relatively small, but it is still sizeable. We must ensure not only that such imports are safe, but that our abattoirs are operating in a competitive environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to say that we are not entirely without fault in this country and the Opposition support the Government's action against the spivs—as described by the Minister—who were discovered during the summer. Nevertheless, there is ample anecdotal evidence that throughout Europe, monitoring is much less effective than in Europe. The Minister mentioned France, where removal of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
spinal cord is done by butchers, which raises horrifying doubts about how effectively the process will be monitored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that monitoring in the rest of Europe is thorough and robust. It should be done regularly and frequently, and any penalties imposed must be tough. Otherwise, British consumers could be at risk from buying meat that has not been properly dressed and our slaughterhouses could be operating in an uncompetitive environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A year or two ago, it was discovered that abattoirs cutting beef in this country were, in theory, doing the job properly, but in practice, there was a considerable amount of splatter from the spinal cord and other SRM onto the fresh carcase. That could easily be happening in Europe. Without effective monitoring and checking, contaminated food could come into this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to raise that issue. We have taken several actions since May. I am not saying that no action was taken by the previous Government, but we have upped the priority given to food safety. There is no question about our rigorous enforcement. From January next year, the hygiene assessment scores in our abattoirs and cutting plants will be published on a monthly basis—a three-monthly rolling average—and the information will be available to everybody. That will apply only to British produce because the scoring system is not run in the rest of Europe, so we are giving the lead in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some time it has not been possible for Britain to argue in Europe for a lead in food safety. We have had one and a half hands tied behind our backs. But the situation is changing. For example, in July we said that we would unilaterally bring in the order on sheep and goat spinal columns if the rest of Europe did not move. We also said that we would go ahead with the measure to remove the material from beef. We were going to do that from October, but agreed to do it from January because the measure is Europe-wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the European Union's responsibility to secure the enforcement of those rules; it is not the responsibility of the British Government. When Ministers and official go to Brussels these days, they do so with their heads held high and a spring in their step because we are in a position to challenge what is happening in Europe. We can say with confidence, "We are doing this. What are you doing?" We are considering a whole range of issues, from the training of vets to other issues involving the food chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not be slow in ensuring that the European Union polices the new rules, which are in the interests of public health, not of political posturing. Public health has to be good enough for this country, and the same must apply to others. That is part of being a member of the European Union. However, we cannot proceed on anecdotal evidence; there must be hard evidence from investigators who move around Europe regularly. We shall be pushing to ensure that action is taken. In the past we may not have been able to shout
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
too loudly, simply because of the baggage that we brought to Brussels, but we are getting rid of that as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobbin</div> <!-- member -->

One of the earliest questions I asked when I walked into the Ministry was about the number of fallen stock. It can end up at the knacker's yard or hunt kennels. Fallen stock are not affected by the order or by my announcement on recovering costs. The local authority checks that part of the industry, but because the stock does not go into the food chain there is no proposal to change the financial regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it the Government's intention to follow SEAC's advice rigidly? Are there not great dangers in doing so?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, much of our policy advice—off the top of my head, I would say a good third of it—comes from outside the Ministry. It comes from independent committees, some statutory and some non-statutory, consisting of people who are at the top of their profession—the creme de la creme—whom we do not pay for their advice. All interests are declared and those committees consider matters in a practical and scientific manner. Obviously, science and practicalities change so the advice is not always rigid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once advice is given, it does not have to be accepted. Under our policy of openness and transparency, if advice is given and Ministers do not act on it, they will have to say so. If Ministers are not prepared to accept advice from SEAC or other independent scientific committees, it behoves us to tell the public that we have received independent scientific advice, but are not minded to accept it. We are then open to the charge of claiming to know better than the scientists, using our ill-informed illogic, and we may be responsible four or five years later, long after we have passed from office, for a major crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be put into that position. That does not mean to say that we slavishly follow the advice that we are given; we question it and sometimes ask for it to be rechecked. Committees themselves sometime say, "We are minded to go this way, but we want to have another look at the matter." SEAC sometimes considers an issue two or three times before it gives advice to Ministers. That is right because it means that

we receive the best advice, and we in this House are not qualified to second-guess it. If we do, we do so at our peril.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed</i>,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 10040/97 on the prohibition of the use of material presenting risks relating to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies; and supports the Government's position that such controls are necessary for the protection of public health and to avoid the risk of undermining the Single Market.—[

	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice:
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat my welcome to the Minister. The Opposition welcome the principle of the proposed instrument. It is a failsafe measure; as the Minister has said, there is no evidence that new variant BSE or new variant CJD can be caught from eating sheepmeat, although the link with beef is now fairly clearly established. I was interested to read in the latest publication of the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Royal Society now leans to the explanation that the origin of the epidemic could well have been the chance occurrence of a rare spontaneous case of BSE in a cow, or a spontaneous BSE-like case in sheep."</p></blockquote>
So it could have been from one animal, through the rendering process and the failure to kill the agent, that the serious problem that we face arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We entirely support the Government in the need to take measures that may be seen to be beyond what is obvious in order to cut off even the faintest chance of infection of the human consumer. However, there are areas of concern. As I implied earlier, I am most concerned about enforcement and monitoring. Those of us who have travelled widely in Europe as private individuals, rather than on an organised visit, know that we see different things depending on the capacity in which we are travelling. We all know that in parts of Europe, the approach to health and food safety leaves a lot to be desired in comparision to our regime, although I accept that there are still problems in certain places in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be enough simply to be certain that the removal of SRM is done properly—not in a slaphappy approach—to ensure that no remains are left. I understand why the Minister cannot be certain that the monitoring of the controls throughout Europe will be performed at least to a standard comparable to that in Britain—in other words, that imported meat from the rest of the continent has been dealt with at least as safely as meat in this country. I am, therefore, slightly puzzled about why the Government should have stepped back from the undertaking given in the summer by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that if such monitoring did not take place, he would protect British consumers by preventing meat from coming into Britain that was not as safe as British meat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reflect on that point. The competence of the monitoring of the operation over the next few months and years may give the British consumer cause for concern over the safety of meat, especially if the Minister is right in saying that it is envisaged that the process will be carried out in
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
butchers' shops in France. Poor monitoring may also damage the competitive environment for our abbatoir system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I questioned the Minister on incineration capacity. Of course he is right to say that we are not talking about the huge volumes that we have at present. However, if there is a problem, the last thing we should do is add to it. We understand that substantial mountains of meat, bonemeal and tallow need to be disposed of—by incineration or perhaps by being used as the fuel for power generation. Even if there is only a small amount, it is not only undesirable, but will still need to be disposed of. More work needs to be done to increase the capacity of disposal systems, whether by incineration or other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred a moment ago to the commitment given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that if the rest of Europe did not use the same slaughterhouse practices as us, he would ban the import of meat from those European slaughterhouses. The Minister will understand that that caused concern in this country, especially as it seemed to fly in the face of the approach to Europe that new Labour told us it would follow. The Minister made it quite clear that if other countries did not agree to those same controls, he would ban the import of such meat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a new scenario, with the new Government running about telling us how wonderful things are going to be in Europe. They are telling us that they are working closely with their partners in Europe and can now achieve so much more. Indeed, I wrote down what the Minister said in answer to a previous question. He said that we could now go into Europe with our heads held high and with a spring in our step. That is interesting. Labour is now in power and we are beginning to see the results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were led to believe that the Government's new approach—their fawning over their European colleagues—would get us what we needed. What has happened? A whole range of things in the Amsterdam treaty are not needed by Britain. Now we have a document that Britain does need—it is clearly important for food safety—yet the Council of Ministers did not agree with it. Our Minister, with his self-proclaimed ability to achieve what he wants for Britain, failed convincingly to persuade the majority of the Council of Ministers to adopt this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating the proposal this morning because the Commission is allowed under the rules to impose it, and not because our new Minister has persuaded other European Ministers to take what is clearly an essential step to ensure that sheepmeat and beef in Europe are entirely safe. That does not bode well for the coming six months, when Britain will hold the presidency of the EU and the debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy will be at the top of the Agriculture Ministers' agenda. It does not suggest that the Government will be able to deliver what Britain needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely worrying that, on a matter as crucial as food safety, the Government cannot persuade other Europen Governments to follow their lead. I come back to my contention that there will be widespread
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
tacit refusal in Europe to carry out effective monitoring and supervision of what is required. I hope that the Minister will reaffirm the commitment that the Government made in the summer to ban the import of meat if they are not absolutely convinced that the processes to remove SRM in the various ways required are being carried out as effectively and safely as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition will not oppose the motion, because it is an essential part of developing confidence in food, of ensuring that even a minimal risk is removed and, as the Minister rightly says, of getting the beef ban lifted. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what steps have been taken to have the beef ban lifted, as that is the one test to show not only that we are operating in a safe food environment—we almost certainly are already—but that we have persuaded the rest of Europe that British beef and, indeed, sheep meat are truly safe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me comment on what has just been said. I am not ravingly in favour of all aspects of Europe, but it hurts me when Opposition Members talk about "Britain and the rest of Europe", as if there was one homogeneous lot of people with practices that are all inferior to those in this country. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire should not be so quick to pass the buck. He should give examples, which clearly he knows, of good practices in the rest of Europe, many of which are considerably better than they are in this country, and he should say where our practices fall short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the hon. Gentleman to be more specific. If there is to be a ban on certain products from certain countries, he should not simply refer to "the rest of Europe" but identify where he thinks the problems are. The problem is not with Denmark, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands or various other countries. We have much information before us, but the fact that the Opposition continually refer to "the rest of Europe" seems to suggest that we smell like roses, whereas we do not in all cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it hard to take when the hon. Gentleman talks of how to deal with a matter "as crucial as food safety". That is a U-turn. What did his party do in the past 10 or 15 years when it was in government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an intervention, so I shall be brief. I am happy to rephrase my words. When I say "the rest of Europe", I mean the other countries in Europe. I accept that Britain is part of Europe—of course it is—so am I not too bothered by the hon. Gentleman's pedantry about my choice of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that some countries in Europe are far more effective in implementing and enforcing the regulations to which they have signed up. I do not have the relevant tables with me, but they are readily available and show how many times each country has been taken to the European Court. If the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my second attendance at the Committee, and I would like to make my credentials clear. I feel the odd one out on this side of the Committee, because I come with an instinctively pro-European position. I endorse the welcome given by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire to the Government's proposals. I think that it has been accepted here today that the Government's approach, more cautious than that of the previous Administration, which may have been more gung-ho, is wise. I recognise the Government's aspiration to deliver food safety, but I want to talk about some of the practical difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we must act with credibility in Europe to ensure that, as the Minister said, we can hold our heads high and move with a spring in our step. However, many people in the agricultural community are concerned about what progress is being made on some real issues connected with the BSE export ban, about which they have made representations to me. It is essential that the Government make immediate progress in that respect. Some progress has been made, but the ban is still in place, 18 months after it was applied. I cannot help feeling that if some of the immediate action that was required and requested in March 1996 had been taken then, we would be an awful lot closer to the ban being lifted than we are today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Government have now been in place for more than six months, and we are reaching the stage where we can ask legitimate questions about how swiftly they are moving towards getting the ban lifted, in comparison to the 12 months when their predecessors were in power, for which there is little to show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to raise with the Minister three issues that arose during the question session. One is the lack of certainty that a mechanism is in place for the efficient removal of the spinal cord—the Minister willingly confirmed that point. I am worried that there will be a consequential reduction in productivity of the slaughtering industry, which will reduce its efficiency and ability to cope with the compliance costs for which the Minister has suggested it will in future be responsible. If the simple economics of the process do not add up for the industry, public safety and food safety will be the losers. I am concerned that there is a mis-match.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to compliance costs. We have made a lot of mistakes in the past by not recognising the transition that must be made from one environment to another. Has the Minister any proposals to ease in those costs and ensure that the industry has a period in which to adapt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Finally, during the question session I raised the issue of cross-EU implementation. I raise it in the most positive spirit possible. There will be swings and roundabouts. On some issues, we will be ahead of our EU partners, but given that the United Kingdom Government are pursuing an aggressive line on food safety—which I fully support and welcome—we should be able to require some assurances from our partners that they are moving in the same direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, I support the Government's intention to be cautious; that is the correct approach—but let us be cautious together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Simpson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the comments by the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green about where we sit on Europe are directly relevant, but I shall make two brief responses to them. As someone born in Norfolk, I remember that in the 1950s in my class at school there were two Polish boys, whose fathers fought in the Polish air force in the last war and could not go home, there was a Jewish Austrian boy, whose parents had fled from Austria in 1938, and there were two boys of Dutch extraction, whose ancestors had come over to develop the fens in the 17th century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discussed the possibility of a regional assembly with a Norfolk farmer, who was totally against it on the grounds that it might be in Cambridge or Peterborough. His words were, "I'd rather be ruled from Brussels than from Peterborough or Cambridge." So there is a regional aspect to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in the interests of the food industry to maintain consumer confidence. It is in the industry's financial interest, apart from anything else. I hope that those who are listening here—in the body of the kirk, as it were—will take that on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During last week's debate on landfill sites, reference was made to compliance. Compliance should be considered in terms of the attitude of British industry and consumers. They believe—perhaps their belief is exaggerated—that, at times, other European countries do not comply with directives. Therefore there is a sense of unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister answered my question on pharmaceutical products honestly, but there is a practical problem in that we must influence the Commission at the earliest possible stage when it is drafting directives. Interestingly, that problem was also mentioned in last week's debate on landfill sites. All too often, the Government or British pressure groups end up squealing loudly when it is too late. I trust that the Minister will realise that we must influence the Commission early on, otherwise we will always be trying make changes when it is too late.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw that comment. However, the hon. Gentleman raised an interesting point about consumer confidence. Many people are meat eaters—
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
probably the majority. However, compared with my parents' or grandparents' generation, there is now a public detachment from the slaughter and preparation of meat. Frankly, the public do not want to know about it. If they did know about it, they would probably be disgusted by it. Nevertheless, they want to eat meat. The food industry and the Government must overcome that major problem, which is in many respects one of public hyprocrisy. However, I believe that it will continue rather than get better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the need to take all necessary precautions and, as a consumer, I support what he said. He and other hon. Members referred to two crucial matters. First, he was honest about the practical problems of developing equipment to meet current needs. In all walks of life, that frequently takes a considerable time. There will always be a hiatus, and that might produce a hiatus in public confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the cost. It is easy for us as consumers to say that where our personal health is concerned, cost does not matter. Am I being too cynical in thinking that, ultimately, the cost will be passed on to us as consumers? What is the likely impact on where consumers shop and what they buy? Is there a price threshold over which consumers are not prepared to pay? We might reach a stage where the Government, the Commission and the industry will say, "Well, we have taken every possible step, and from now on we will take just some form of added value."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for confidence and health, I refer the Minister to the decision that his Department may or may not take this month about the establishment of a food standards agency. I have an interest in that, as do hon. Members from all parties who represent the county of Norfolk. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will consider seriously the idea that such an agency should be centred in the Norwich research park, which has a wide range of facilities that would meet the Government's requirements and those of the food industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones, for that guidance. The food research park emphasises the whole food chain, which is central to the discussion. I did not mention the park simply as a plea on behalf of my constituency but because it is crucial that, rather than adopting measures late—that is, slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted—we get the research right now, not only to deal with what has happened in the past but because of problems that we might, God forbid, face in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too am a new Member. I entered Parliament as a European sceptic and the longer that I have been here, the more sceptical I have become. I have discovered that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is almost powerless—that his only power is that of persuasion,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
whereby he must try to influence his colleagues in Europe over decisions. He has not been doing very well, because the only matter that unites us all in Europe is self-interest. Most of the other countries are interested in their own beef industry, and if they can keep us out of the market, so much the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive comes from the EC and I suppose that we must go along with it whether we like it or not, because those in Brussels are our bosses now and we must follow them. It is completely unnecessary and will have little effect. If it was necessary, it should have been introduced several years ago. The likelihood of BSE turning up in sheep is extremely remote, so much a precaution is extreme, as well as superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive will place additional costs on the entire industry. The sum of £26 million has been referred to, and such a cost is unnecessary. When he was in opposition the Minister used to say, "We are the only ones who play cricket." I agree. We admit to all our wrongdoings and we follow procedures meticulously. I am not convinced that those in the rest of Europe do that—a subject on which the hon. Gentleman touched today. The directive will apply to the abattoirs and killing houses in this country, but in France it will apply to the butchers. It will be difficult to police the situation in France. I have little confidence that all those butchers will carry out the directive to the letter of the law. Whether they have the ability or expertise to do so needs to be questioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the order will give confidence to the public, but I believe that the reverse is true. Many people do not believe a word the Government say. They believe that BSE is far more extensive than the Government admit. When the Government say, "We shall take extra precautions with regard to sheep", they believe that the Government are trying to hide the fact that BSE is already found in sheep. Rather than giving people confidence, that statement will sap it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no such thing as absolute safety; the Government are wrong to follow the recommendations slavishly. It is the Government's duty to weigh up the various factors, to make their own decisions and then to stand by them. They will have to do that in the end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is whether this proposal is a sensible way in which to spend £26 million. Will it improve public health? There seems to be extraordinary momentum behind the belief that there is a link between BSE and CJD, and that we must thunder along with every whim. I was in America when the crisis broke a year ago. I quote from the medical science section of the 
	<i>New York Times</i> of 2 April 1996, which states of CJD that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the disease is 60 times more common than usual among inhabitants of one region of Slovakia, and 40 times higher among Libyans who emigrated to Israel many years ago. There is also a high incidence among Sephardic Jews who immigrated to France from Tunisia and Algeria."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
We have not progressed much further, despite the millions of pounds spent on research over the past 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A link is likely between BSE and the new form of CJD, but it is not proven. In answer to the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green, the figures for new CJD over the past three years are three deaths in 1995, 10 deaths in 1996 and five in the first half of this year. I agree with the Minister that those with the disease suffer a horrendous death. It is perfectly dreadful for all the relatives and we should offer our deepest sympathy to those who have been involved. However, we should also remember the 20 families in Scotland who lost relations this year because of the E. coli outbreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that there are other ways in which to spend £26 million than to blow it on pursuing every single whim in trying to eliminate BSE. No medical case has been made for a link between BSE in sheep and CJD in humans. It is a huge waste of money. It will accelerate a dangerous trend, which I discussed recently with colleagues in the meat industry, towards the wholesale closure of the smaller abattoir. The result of that is that cattle are driven longer distances, arrive in a higher state of stress and are held for longer in yards in frightening conditions which, putting it bluntly, accelerate their bowel movements and make them scour, thus spreading more disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document will put further pressure on small abattoirs and give more business to the big boys, the only ones who can make the necessary investment. That will be deleterious to public health. This is the wrong time to raise the question of BSE and CJD. Red meat consumption figures are now higher than before the crisis, yet the hare is being set to run again. That will do nothing for public confidence; it will merely wave the red flag again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I talked this morning with an abattoir man. He has not yet successfully removed the spine from a sheep, and certainly not in the slaughterhouse. He reckons that he will have to let the carcase cool and do it the next day in the cutting plant. We have talked about delays in the production chain; the proposal instantly adds an extra day to the production process on all sheep over 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate has been friendly but, given that the measure will be implemented on 4 January, it is pathetic that on 19 November, the Minister cannot name one abattoir that has, on a commercial basis, taken the spines out of a run of sheep. I hope that the Minister will tell me what I should tell the people who work in abattoirs in my area. How on earth will they cope with the measure given that there does not seem to have been any input from those with sound, practical, industrial experience?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure will drive up the price of mutton and lamb—the background papers show the horrific costs resulting from the loss of value in sheep. That will be an advantage to the producers of other red meat. It will clobber the hill farmers near my constituency, who are already struggling under the measures imposed by the Government.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
As to the attitudes on Europe, the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green is obsessed by his belief that all Conservative Members are anti-European. I declare my interest again. I am president of a European organisation—the European Tanners Confederation. I want a free market with the rules imposed on a level basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in the 
	<i>Farmers Guardian</i>—I think that it was in August—said that approximately 1,650 of the heifers and bullocks that had been exported to mainland Europe since 1988 would have contracted BSE if they had remained in this country. They had had the same background and food as cattle here; the only difference was that they had been exported. The grand total of BSE cases among them was 298, and some of the countries to which they were exported did not declare any BSE cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely concur with my hon. Friends. There must be very real doubts about how well the measure will be inplemented in the rest of Europe. It will particularly affect this country, as we have a large sheep industry. I do not believe that it will do anything for public health. It will divert the attention of veterinary surgeons and health authorities from real health problems, such as in the large abattoirs where E. coli is a much more serious matter. It will raise the issue of BSE and CJD in the public eye at just the wrong time. It will probably increase the price of mutton and lamb in this country and it will clobber small abattoirs. It is a thoroughly bad measure and I intend to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) is right to say that there is no proven link between BSE, sheep and CJD. No research has shown proof of such a link, but we need to learn the lessons of history. At the end of the 1970s, there were reports about the possible pattern of BSE in the food chain and Ministers were advised to exercise caution. Ministers in the 1979 Government took a similar attitude to that of the hon. Gentleman. Links were unproven, so they said that they did not need to spend money or tighten regulations. Eighteen years on, we find that that has cost us hundreds of millions of pounds and the deaths of millions of cattle at a grave cost to the beef industry. The problem could have been dealt with properly if the previous Government had taken a cautious approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a gross distortion of what I said. I said that research had not yet proved a direct link and that when we were in power, our Government took very strong measures that have now virtually eradicated BSE—it will disappear. There are other health areas that we should consider; £26 million is an awful lot of money, and we should consider this morning whether the proposals are the best way in which to spend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Borrow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman because he illustrates my point, which is that the previous Administration did too little too late to deal with the problems of BSE. They took the approach that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
hon. Gentleman is taking in respect of this order—that unless there is clear proof of a link between BSE, sheep and CJD, we should not spend £26 million to tighten up our public health system. That approach, which the hon. Gentleman is taking now, was the philosophy that was in place in the early 1980s under the previous Administration. As a result of that philosophy, things were not done then that should have been done, and because they had to be done later on, we ended up paying a lot more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the £26 million that will be the cost of implementing the order will be totally wasted money if there proves to be no link and no danger to public health. However, we shall know that only after the event. If we are receiving strong advice that we ought to be cautious and tighten up our public health regime by spending £26 million to implement the proposed regulations, I would rather that we did that so that I can face my constituents in 10 or 20 years' time confident that we took the measures proposed in the report, rather than, for the sake of saving £26 million now, risk grave danger in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are absolutely right, Mr. Jones, and I stand corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of difference between the hon. Member for North Shropshire and myself is that he represents a constituency that is more farming-related than mine. My constituency has one farm for educational purposes, which has one cow, one sheep, and so on, so I can hardly speak up for the industry. That does not mean that we should not think about the industry; we must consider expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I do not understand is the hon. Gentleman and other Conservative members of the Committee saying that to have a discussion about goats and sheep now will remind the whole nation about BSE. All sorts of people are here writing our debate down who will remind people which way we vote, whatever we do. If
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
they want to report us in the newspapers, they will do so. I have no doubt about that. The overwhelming majority of people will take exactly the opposite view from that expressed by the Opposition. If we do not vote for caution on the issue, they will say, "You are no better than the previous Government." We all know the enormous damage done by the previous Government from sitting back and doing nothing for years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very familiar with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has an incubation period of about 20 years. The previous Conservative Government made horrendous mistakes with the original CJD. They sat on incorrect medical advice for seven years and the checking mechanism of hormone treatment was horrendously medically inadequate. We were late in dealing with BSE. If we do not follow good advice, which may be changing as my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier, or take action, the consumer will say, "My goodness, this Government are no better than the one we had before." Most people believe that we have a much better Government now and that caution is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green raised a specific issue about the incubation period of CJD. I understand that there is not a specific number of years' incubation period, but that it depends on the genes of the patient. In terms of sporadic CJD, it may be between 15 to 20 years. It is not precise, but it is a long time and we cannot be certain. We are taking action because of the uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures were recommended initially by SEAC, which advises the Government on such issues. They were also recommended by a different set of European scientific experts. The proposals had been floated around Europe previously, but had not been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made a point earlier, and I thought that I had vastly misunderstood what had happened in the summer. The order was rejected two years ago by the Council of Ministers because not enough member states agreed to it. We changed it and pushed for it, and my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food went to Brussels frequently—he is there again this week—and argued the case, based on our scientific evidence. He got more member states to agree so that when the Commission was persuaded to bring up the proposal again, it was accepted. If that counts as a failure by my right hon. Friend to make progress in Brussels, we are not using the English language very fairly. We persuaded more member states to support a proposal that had originally been made in 1996. Hence, the measures, which apply to the whole of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer the Minister to the third report of the Select Committee on European Legislation. Paragraph 2.1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A previous proposal was put to the Council in December. On that occasion the Council rejected the Commission proposal. At the Agriculture Council on 22–23 July the Council failed to either adopt the Commission proposal by qualified majority or to reject it by simple majority.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission took the action it did because it knew that more member states than before had agreed to it. That was simply because of lobbying by the United Kingdom Government.

I accept that we are divided in the Room on the matter, but let us not be ridiculous about it. We are discussing a major public health issue. Movement has been made in Brussels and the Commission, which is to everyone's advantage.

	<i>Interruption</i>.] We know the price of staying on the Opposition Front Bench these days; it is rather high in terms of Euroscepticism. I am not about to start a brand new debate at this stage in our proceedings, but I honestly think that the hon. Gentleman is taking things a little too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Shropshire made a serious point when he referred to the tragic cases of people with CJD. He mentioned the Slovak and Libyan Jewish cases, which were genetic cases of CJD that affected two unfortunate families. That form is not the new variant CJD; there is a big difference between the new variant CJD and genetic CJD. Scientific advice in recent weeks has shown that the new variant CJD is, in effect, BSE. It is not the same as the genetic form of CJD. The cases to which the hon. Gentleman referred—tragic though they are—are completely unrelated to the order that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) obviously believes that we are all completely wasting our time. I must tell the Committee, however, about the first hon. Member who came to see me in my capacity as Minister of State to put his special case to me for his country and its beef farmers. The hon. Member for Antrim North, (Reverend Ian Paisley) put his case to me, as a European, in a very pleasant and amicable way. He realised the benefits of taking a common European approach to the matter and not picking off one part of the United Kingdom from another. He argued that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, trouble. I am interested in the Minister's argument that no part of the United Kingdom should receive precedence in the lifting of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
the BSE ban. What assurance can he give Scottish beef farmers that that is the case, given that we now have two groups who have tried to lift the BSE ban, neither of whose efforts seem to be near a conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, coming from a member of the Committee who represents a Scottish constituency. However, I did say that the hon. Member for Antrim, North was not seeking to pick off one part of the United Kingdom against another. Being a good European and a Member of the European Parliament, he was making the case that matters were slightly different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a system that will work United Kingdom-wide. We want a set of rules or a progressive lifting of the ban throughout the country. Different parts of the United Kingdom may be able to slot in before other parts, but all parts should be eligible. However, one substantial difference between Northern Ireland and England, Scotland and Wales is the computer traceability system—a matter to which I shall refer in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a UK-wide lifting of the ban. Some certified herds might be put on a database and different parts of the country may meet the conditions before other parts. We want a UK rule; we are not interested in allowing one part of the United Kingdom to be picked off before another part. The hon. Member for West Tyrone has said constantly this morning that we are doing too much too soon, and that we are wasting money. I accept that I am about to paraphrase him unfairly, but he was really saying that not enough people have died for us to take such action. We are operating openly on a theoretical risk a risk that has been put to us by independent scientists—and are doing so before people die. That is what the precautionary principle is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with old lamb—mutton—not spring lamb. There is no problem. We shall do nothing new to 90 per cent. of the sheep slaughtered—only 2.5 million out of 18 million will be affected. We shall just check that old sheep do not slip through the system; hence the extra cost. We are doing that on the basis of a theoretical risk, before anyone dies. It is not even a practical possibility. No sheep have been found to have BSE. We believe that it is right to take that action, given the advice that we have received. The hon. Member for North Shropshire might dissent from that view—but frankly, he is wrong to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respect the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk. Any Member who sees the possibility of new jobs, new agencies, new plants—whether public or private sector—and does not put in a bid for them is not doing his job. The hon. Gentleman is not the first person to put his case to me, either publicly or privately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People ask for the food standards agency to be based in their area on the premise that the work is not being done at present. Much to my surprise as a non-MAFF person—I have probably asked only 20 parliamentary questions of the Ministry in 20 years as a Member—hundreds of civil servants work on food safety, but the public do not know about them. They do world-class work protecting the public. Their work has been overshadowed by the big crises of E. coli and
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
BSE, but they have plodded on dealing with contaminants, food safety, labelling, checking genetically modified organisms and so on. There are almost 300 such people; more than 50 of them work in the Department of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that such work is not done is wrong. The food agency is not being created in a vacuum; it is being created by experts who are already on the job. It is not a matter of developing a green-field site, nor of creating a new role or function. Nevertheless, all possibilities will be considered. The White Paper will be published shortly, and that will start a debate on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) was right to say that there are practical problems with the efficiency of the operation in abattoirs. I do not deny that the directive represents an extra burden. It will be necessary to kill the same number of sheep, ensure that some bits and pieces—the specified risk materials—are removed from 2·5 million of the 18 million sheep and check that they do not enter the food chain. The meat is okay; we shall simply have removed the specified risk materials. Normal healthy food will still be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what I said in answer to hon. Member's questions: this European measure has been adopted and member states will be expected to comply with it, although there might be differences in how they do so. The Government take the view that the work should be done in controlled supervised conditions in licensed abattoirs, slaughterhouses and meat-cutting plants. We shall be the first to complain if, after investigation, it transpires that that is not done in other countries and that they therefore have problems. European food safety is important to all our citizens. There is no question of our introducing the system, but ignoring what happens elsewhere. We are members of the European Union, and European investigators will monitor the effect of the directive in each country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last thing that I intend to do, at half-past 12 is to start a new debate on costs. I have been open with the Committee, and it would be wrong of me to allow any misunderstanding to occur. We are not, as has been suggested, talking about £26 million of public money; the industry will pay for the measures, because we shall recoup the costs, as I said in my opening statement. The costs for the cattle are in addition to that, and we shall consult fully on such matters, which do not form part of the draft order. I do not want anyone to run away with the idea that I said that the process would be free for the first three months of next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire has broadly, and in many details, welcomed the order. I realise that he is unhappy about some aspects of it around the edges, and I fully understand why he has to say so. The order will have a major impact on the industry. We announced it in July—it is not something that we have announced today for implementation in January—and we accept that it will cause difficulties. However, those difficulties are not insuperable. We have a professional and efficient industry in this country; our farming industry as a whole is far more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
efficient than those of most of our European partners. Nevertheless, in the interests of public health and food safety we think it right to introduce the order—and it was right to announce it in the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that because of the vagaries of the parliamentary recess it has taken until now for the order to come before the Committee, on a day when, because of other discussions in Brussels, the issue has been complicated. However, it is the ethos of the Ministery and of the Government to be as open with the House as possible, because we need to take the country and the House with us in respect of food safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Food safety cannot be run on the cheap. The total costs of BSE will run to £4 billion, and at the end of the day the taxpayer pays for that. It is tragic; that money could have been spent on hospitals or education. It is unplanned public expenditure, and it will amount to nearly £1 billion this year. That is not by any stretch of the imagination a good use of public resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Committee for ensuring that we have scrutinised the order this morning. There is a good deal to it; it is technical and complicated and has many ramifications for the farming and meat production industries. However, the raw essence of our proposals is not a change to the way in which cattle are dealt with in this country—that is for our
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
European partners. There will be a fairly modest change affecting elderly sheep—those aged over 12 months. The meat is still safe. The order will mean a change in practices in the abattoirs and cutting plants, but in the interests of food safety we are right to make that change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
