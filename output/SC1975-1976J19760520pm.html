	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has forgotton that there is a new clause down dealing with roll-over relief, and no doubt we can discuss this matter in far greater detail on that new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that a trader may wish to dispose of his capital asset, his land, an asset which he used for the purposes of his trade, not trading stock. There may be circumstances where he would pay development land tax. But the price he gets for the current use value of that property might often be sufficient to enable him to roll-over into another property. We are not talking here about current use value, but about tax on the development, and it does not necessarily follow that he should have to pay the same amount for the new property because he will be taxed on the development value of the old property, and it does not follow that the new property will have development value or that he would need to purchase development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although there may be cases of that kind, they may not be as numerous as the right hon. Gentleman may have given the impression. No doubt we will come back to this when we discuss roll-over relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 8, Noes 5.</p>

	<p>these two amendments together, Mr. Crawshaw. They both relate to the same point of principle, even though they are directed at rather different aspects of the schedule. It is that the right to elect to pay on instalment should exist where there is no cash to pay the tax. We are saying in both amendments that there should be no limit to that right. We can see no reason for putting in a limit so long as one assumes that people are not actually defrauding the system. That is surely the rationale behind the right to elect under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1485</span>
deemed disposal and under the triggering mechanisms, for otherwise charities, for instance, would have to pay tax in a situation where they had gone into limbo. Other triggering factors are involved, and where this requirement to pay tax is triggered off, so long as no cash is coming in, the Opposition say that there should be no time limit upon which the election to pay in instalments should exist.</p>

	<p>We say this with regard to the seven-year time limit which appears in subparagraph (3) (
	<i>b</i>), to which Amendment No. 256 refers, and we say it also on page 155, line 34 of Schedule 8, where the issue is a different one and to which Amendment No. 281 relates. The issue here concerns a landlord whose tenant engages in an activity which results in DLT becoming payable, but where the landlord is not the immediate beneficiary because he has a limit on the point at which he can put up his rent. Although, currently, the Bill allows him to defer tax and to enjoy the benefit of the instalment election within eight years, we do not see why that eight ears should be the limit if it turns out that the landlord is not able to benefit in terms of cash beyond the period of eight years.</p>

	<p>The only point we want to make here—and it seems an eminently suitable one—is that DLT liability and the payment of DLT in instalments should occur when the cash becomes available to pay it and not before. We can foresee circumstances in which the period that charities may want in one case, or landlords may require in another case, may well be longer than the limits that the Bill allows. Indeed, we cannot see, in reason or logic, why there should be any limit at all. All that is needed is to establish the principle that the tax can be paid by instalments when the cash becomes available.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Development land tax, which becomes payable following a period of deferment, may be paid by instalments if the triggering event is not an actual disposal, for example, where land which was developed for industrial use ceases to be used for that purpose, provided that—this is where the hon. Gentleman takes objection to the legislation—the triggering event occurs within seven years of the deemed disposal which gave rise to the liability. Amendment No. 256 seeks to remove that time limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1486</span>
We are concerned with the position where there is a deemed disposal and when the triggering event takes place but is not actual disposal, but is a case of triggering, perhaps, where land ceases to be used for industrial purposes. The triggering, in fact, does not produce money out of which the taxpayer can pay his development land tax. Under the Bill, it is provided that instalment provisions will apply, provided the triggering event occurs within seven years of the deemed disposal. The hon. Gentleman said "why do we need a period of seven years at all; why cannot we do away with the period of seven years and merely provide that instalments are always allowed where that kind of triggering takes place?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go on to Amendment No. 281, which is not entirely the same, but deals to some extent with the same point. It is concerned with subparagraphs (5) and (6) of paragraph 44 of Schedule 8. These deal with the situations where a landlord has an interest in reversion, on one or more leases, and a project of material development is carried out on his land by a lessee from which he cannot benefit until the date of a rent review. if the review takes place within eight years of the start of the project, the landlord may pay his DLT by instalments, the first instalment being due one year after the rent review, and the last not later than eight years from the review date, or twelve years from the deemed disposal, whichever is the earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of these amendments would be to allow the landlord to pay his tax, by instalments, over an eight-year period starting one year from the date of the rent review, whether or not that falls within eight years of the project and without the over-riding limit for completion of payment by instalments of twelve years from the deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as Amendment No. 281 is concerned, I accept that there is merit in the hon. Gentleman's case—I do not wish to sound condescending—and I am prepared to go some way to meet him on it. I will go some way to meet the hon. Gentleman and provide that the eight year requirement could be dropped, provided that the whole of the tax is paid within twelve years of the deemed disposal. I give an assurance that I will put an amendment down on Report to provide for that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1487</span>
Regarding Amendment No. 256, again I can see some force in the hon. Gentleman's argument, as we are concerned here with a situation where there is a triggering but no money to pay the tax. It could be argued that we should make some provision to pay by instalment. I am prepared to accept, in principle, Amendment No. 256, but I am uncertain about the drafting and again assure the Committee that we will put an amendment down on Report to meet the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have been able to meet the hon. Gentleman on both his main points—Amendment No. 256 and Amendment No. 281, subject to applying to the latter a proviso that the tax be paid within the twelve years. We will put amendments down on Report. With those assurances, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. The Minister has accepted the principle and I am grateful. It would be churlish of me to do anything other than to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend takes the step which I think he was contemplating, I must say that I am still not satisfied that if there is a time limit put on at all, it is really within the concession, which is made earlier in the Bill, to those who have had their tax deferred when there has been a deemed disposal. If it is deferred that should mean that the tax does not become payable until it is triggered off by an actual disposal at a later date. In both cases, the schedule, in small print on the back of the ticket, as it were, says that one cannot go all the way on this journey. One has been given a ticket for complete deferment of the tax, and then told one has to pay at some time, although there is not the actual disposal from which the proceeds are taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been kind enough to extend the time in the second amendment. Perhaps I was not listening very carefully. I did not understand that he was extending the time on the first amendment, the seven years—nor did I understand that he accepted Amendment No. 256 or even the principles of it in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1488</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he accepts the principle of it, and is putting in a different period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The period of twelve years, in fact, relates to Amendment No. 281, and not to Amendment No. 256.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not pay proper attention when the Minister was speaking. On the first amendment, I understand that he is not prepared to give any concession at all, that he still wants the tax paid after seven years, and that there should only be deferment for a seven-year period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have accepted Amendment No. 256 in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be so wooden-headed on this matter. That means that so far as the first amendment is concerned the deferment may go on for ever. It will be triggered off only by an actual disposal. So far as the second amendment is concerned, the Minister gives us twelve years instead of eight years. On that basis, Amendment No. 256 having been moved, my hon. Friend is right to consider that he has won that point. He has won the day there and does not need to press it to a Division. Unless the Minister thinks it right to take it out just as it is, the amendment is entirely correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have accepted it in principle, but I should like to look at it further because I think there are one or two points of drafting to consider. I give an assurance that I will put an amendment down on Report which will cover the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister. I have it right now, I think. I must express dissatisfaction that there still be a time limit in the second amendment. I think we should like to consider that further when we come to a later stage in the Bill to see how it fits in then. We should have to consider whether one can put a limit on one and not a limit on the other, and see whether we want to come back to the second amendment at a later stage in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have cleared up the matter, and we are grateful for the concession, particularly on Amendment

No. 256. We shall probably return to the other issue later under a separate amendment. I think we have made a lot of progress and I am grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Crawshaw. These amendments are a further response to criticisms made in the Committee of the interpretation provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal purpose of the amendments is to introduce an index to the definitions used in Part III of Schedule 8 and bring some of the definitions together in a new paragraph. They make no substantive changes in the Bill and are largely self-explanatory. There has been some criticism of definitions, especially the fact that they are not all grouped together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to meet at least some of the criticisms during the progress of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1490</span>
Committee. This is another attempt to do so and to provide an index to the definitions to Part III of Schedule 8. I hope that this improves the Bill and makes it slightly easier for those who will have to apply this legislation to find their way from one clause to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister could give us an assurance that there is no definition in this amendment different from those which will appear in the text of the Bill. What I have in mind is looking for the meaning of anything. If the reader is reading the text of the schedules the natural thing would be to turn to the interpretation section in the text of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have a group of definitions in the schedule relating only to the schedule, if I understand the position correctly. I have not been studious enough to take cross-references to see whether they are also defined in some other way in another part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, for example, "relevant period" which, I think, comes into other parts of the Bill, relating to the relevant project. Although that does refer us to paragraph 44, that is not the interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if we are to have an interpretation clause for a schedule and an interpretation clause for the Bill, I am anxious that there should be no discrepancy in the definitions between one and another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks, because I do not know.

	<p>
	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 453, in page 154, line 38, leave out from 'in' to first 'this' in line 39.—[
	<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 433, in page 154, line 47, after 'disposal', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'Provided that in no case shall the first instalment fall due prior to the receipt of cash (in respect of the relevant disposal) equivalent to not less than the amount of the first instalment'.</p></blockquote>
Broadly, this concerns the point at which the first instalment, where people have the right to elect to pay instalments, falls due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1491</span>
The point that we are making is that which we made on the previous amendments, namely that the first instalment should not fall due prior to receipt of cash. It is the same point—but more specifically put on the question of when the first instalment falls due—as we made on the question of the limit under which one could elect to continue to pay under instalments under the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not an enormous amount that I wish to say, except to underline the point that the Minister accepted during debate on the previous amendments, that the principle should be "Pay when you get the cash". We hope that, as he accepted this principle with its more broad implications, that he will accept it on this more narrow point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment goes much wider than the previous one. In the previous amendment I accepted the principle that until there is a disposal, tax should be paid by instalments. Once there is a disposal there is a triggering-off of the liability. The disposal is not necessarily related to the receipt of money, it is a disposal which may lead to the receipt of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But here we are asked to extend the principle further to deal with a case where there is a receipt of cash, or to say that the first instalment shall not fall due until the money is actually received following a disposal. It is the receipt of cash that matters in this case not the disposal itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been over this ground before and have had debates where I argued that we cannot accept the principle that tax should apply on the actual receipt of cash because the scope for avoidance is considerable. It would be easy to delay receipt and to borrow money to cover the loss of receipt. These problems have arisen before in relation to capital gains tax.

	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1492</span>

	<p>I could not possibly accept the amendment. If the principle were receipt of cash we should never get the tax at all in many cases because avoidance devices would grow up to prevent receipt. Since receipt would trigger the tax no tax would be payable. I recommend the Committee to reject the amendment.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is quite right—there is a much bigger issue of principle between us on this than I had at first indicated. It goes to the nub of my basis resentment about the Bill. It is not just a question of actual gains or receipts or money that is being taxed, but notional receipts and hypothetical gains which may turn out to be losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I think I was right in saying that this amendment was aimed at a specific and narrow point, the Minister is right to say that the issue at stake is a wider one of principle and, since it is one of principle and it is the principle to which we should be wedded—that one pays tax when one has had gains—I advise my right hon. and hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing here with a specifically obnoxious tax in the sense that hypothetical values play a strong rôle in it in a way which they do not in other taxes. I think it is perfectly fair to argue that, where we are dealing with such totally hypothetical gains, special provisions should exist in this Bill to compensate for the fact that we are dealing in many part of it with hypothetical gains. This whole Bill is so totally different from other Bills—it covers a wholly new form of taxation—that it is perfectly legitimate to argue that anything one says of this tax does not necessarily apply to other taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another amendment with which I suppose you might have linked No. 281, had you felt so minded, Mr. Crawshaw, because it is related to the question of the eight-year limit, on which the Minister has generously given a concession of twelve years. If it is in order—having had that concession—to make the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) hinted at, I must say that we on this side feel that there is no need for a limit here. The Minister has thought about this and no doubt feels differently. Certainly, twelve years is better than eight, but again we feel that the principle should be that the time the rent change takes place and when the landlord is actually able to benefit from the change in the value of his holding marks the point at which any tax he has to bear should be computed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That period might well be outside twelve years, although I accept that it is unlikely. But it could be, and we do not see why there should be any limit at all. I certainly feel that it is a good step forward and a major improvement to the Bill to change it from eight years to twelve, although in that sense, clearly the amendment as it stands does not relate to what we intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue here is the question of unpaid tax when an error has been made on the original computation. Under the terms of the Bill not only is the amount outstanding from the due date immediately repayable which is perfectly acceptable, but so is the interest on that outstanding amount since the reckonable date. This situation would presumably exist even if the error on tax liability on the original computation had been made by someone other than the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible, and we had a debate on who should compute the tax yesterday, that an error might have been made by someone other than the taxpayer. For instance, it might have been made by the Inland Revenue. In those circumstances, it would clearly be unfair if not only the original amount had to be repaid, but the interest on it as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore feel that unless we can amend this situation in some way or other, and this may not be the right way to go about it, it puts a burden upon the taxpayer which might, in certain circumstances, be unfair to him. Perhaps one could say that there is a lot of double thinking, or that the taxpayer, in many ways, seems to get the worst of all worlds when it comes to this error factor. I have a case in my constituency at present under a DGT assessment, where a payment on account has been made—and I know that there are various problems about DGT being defined as an income tax and so forth— but my constituent is finding it difficult to get any kind of recognition both that an error was made and that tax was paid in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an unimportant issue and I hope that the Minister will be able to give us a sympathetic response to the points I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 230 seeks to leave out words which relate to paragraph 46(3)(

	<span class='label label-info column'>1495</span>
Paragraph 46(3) of Schedule 8 relates to the payment of instalments which need to be revised following a revision in the amount of DLT payable. Such a situation could arise in various ways. For example a project of material development may be revised to include additional development not treated as a separate project, or where an appeal is made against an assessment, the settlement of the appeal may lead to an adjustment of the assessment or at an earlier stage the amount of the postponed tax might be revised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove paragraph 46(3)(
	<i>b</i>), which provides for the excess of any revised instalments which have become due over the amount of those instalments as previously calculated to become payable immediately. The hon. Gentleman referred, in particular, to the question of charging interest. Under the paragraph as it stands, it is provided that for the purpose of charging interest the additional amount due on any instalment, to date, is to be regarded as having been payable on the date of that instalment. The omission of this provision would leave past instalments to be recalculated under paragraph 46(3)(
	<i>b</i>) without any direction as to when the additional tax is payable or how the provisions for interest on overdue tax are to be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says it is unfair that this should be the case, but I cannot go along with him. The Bill as it stands makes sense, and the omission of the provision would leave past instalments to be recalculated. There would be no provision about direction as to when the additional tax is payable or how the provision for interest or overdue tax is to be applied. I do not think there is an injustice here, and I do not feel I would be justified in saying to the Committee that I would look at it, because I believe that the provisions are fair, and there would be a considerable amount of redrafting if we were to look at it without any corresponding benefit. I am advised that there would be very little benefit to the taxpayer, so I recommend the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) The reference in sub-paragraph (4) above to the liability for the tax arising on a part disposal consisting of the grant of a lease includes a reference to the case where—

	<ol>

	<li>by virtue of paragraph 43(4) (

	<li>the disposal which under paragraph 43(4) (
	<i>a</i>) above determines the time of that event is a part disposal consisting of the grant of a lease.'</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 450 is a drafting amendment aimed at simplifying the text by using the phrase "the tax" which has previously been defined for the purpose under paragraph 46 of Schedule 8. Our amendment seeks to make the legislation simpler.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 451 relates to the situation in which payment of DLT has been deferred and is triggered by the grant of a lease at a commercial rent. The DLT which becomes payable in these circumstances may, under the provisions of subparagraph (4) of paragraph 43 of Schedule 8, be paid by instalments. In this situation, part of the tax should become payable on receipt of a premium. Paragraph 46(4) of Schedule 8, as drafted, does not have this effect, because under paragraph 43(4) (
	<i>b</i>) the liability is treated as arising on an event and not on the grant of the lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new subparagraph (4A) of paragraph 46—that is Amendment No. 451—makes good this deficiency by applying paragraph 46(4) to the notional operative event under paragraph 43(4) (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>). The result is that if an amount is paid by way of premium on the lease before the whole of the tax has been paid by instalments, an appropriate part of the outstanding tax then becomes payable and the instalments are recalculated. The instalment provisions are designed to meet the situation where the taxpayer does not receive a lump sum of money out of which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1497</span>
he can pay his tax. But if on the granting of a lease he receive sa premium, he is getting at least some money out of which he can pay his tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to amend the Bill so that when he receives a premium a proportionate part of the instalments are brought to an end and the tax is triggered off and is payable in respect of the proportionate parts of the premium. With regard to the rest, the instalments will continue, but then it involves a recalculation. The receipt of a premium is no different in this regard from an actual sale of the lease and the premium is a lump sum, and in respect of that premium we see no reason why instalment provisions should continue to apply with regard to that particular premium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the principle of the Ministers amendments. Clearly, if there is an actual disposal in the nature of a premium for a lease, the situation is changed. I wonder whether the procedure is clear on the question of giving notices and that sort of thing. It is not easy to apply the general provision, for example, about notices of disposal and all the business that we have had previously in this schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that on the granting of a lease for a premium, and for nearly a rack rent, the parties will not realise that there is a liability for tax. I am not quite sure how one makes them realise this and if they do realise it what they have to do about it. It may even become more complicated if a premium is paid for an extension of a lease. If there is a variation of a lease such that it is not an extension provided for under the lease itself, and the premium is paid for that, the parties may not realise, thinking that it is only a matter between lessor and lessee, that a liability for tax arises. If it does arise, will it be clear how the vendor becomes assessed to tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume—and this a is general remark—that there will be booklets, leaflets or directions from the Board advising people on this tax, and that we shall have to rely on those to a considerable extent in the practical administration of the tax. It would probably be hopeless to expect anyone to real through Schedule 8, as we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1498</span>
have done on this Committee, and try to understand what he has to do in order to become liable for the tax or in order to escape the penalties for not giving the proper notices, and so on. Perhaps the Minister can give us an assurance that the usual sort of pamphlet or booklet will be issued fairly quickly after the Bill gets Royal Assent so that people will know what to do, particularly in this sort of case which, on the face of it, does not seem to be the sort of case that would give rise to liability, but I reiterate that I agree it should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Turning first to Amendment No. 450, I do not think that even the Minister will claim that this amendment is a great leap forward to the end of the twentieth century. But if he wants to use the word "tax" as opposed to "liability", or if the draftsman does, so be it. One notices, on a general point throughout the Bill, that the draftsman seems to be having trouble with words, running out of words and getting bored with the use of certain words. In many ways one sympathises with him. The word "relevant" is one that he has trouble with from time to time. As the Bill progresses, the word "relevant" tends to progress with it. Words are clearly a great problem in the Bill, and in so far as the Bill has to exist I think that perhaps the draftsman has taken too much stick to it in some cases. In some ways he has done a rather better job of using words than perhaps he is given credit for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share my right hon. Friends, and, indeed, the Minister's view that if money becomes available in the form of premium, tax in various deferral and instalment procedures should cease. This would absolutely fit in with the kind of amendments that we were moving earlier and which were aimed at the general point that one pays tax when one gets cash or benefit. That should have been the basic principle throughout this Bill. Therefore, this amendment fits in with our general thesis and general stand on this whole form of taxation, and there is nothing with which one would want to quarrel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The existing paragraph 47 provides that where development land tax is payable by instalments on the grant of a lease and the reversioner realises development value, either by a subsequent disposal for consideration of the whole or part of his interest or by increasing the rent above the commercial rent, the instalment arrangement is terminated. The amendment substitutes an extended version of paragraph 47 to ensure that payment by instalment is terminated in two further sets of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is where tax which has been deferred—in the sense of Clause 26—has become payable on the grant of a lease, payment is being made by instalments, and before the end of the instalment period there is a disposal of the reversion. That triggers off the ending of the instalment provision. The second case is when instalments have been paid after the deferred charge has been triggered by an event and this is followed by an actual disposal of the interest in land or by a part-disposal consisting of the grant of a lease at a rent exceeding the commercial rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In each of these sets of circumstances development value is realized—that is on the sale of a reversion in one case, and the disposal consisting of a grant of a lease at a rent exceeding the commercial rent in the other—and there are no grounds for a continuation of an instalment arrangement. The revised paragraph ensures that the balance of tax will become payable. Again, this is a provision whereby the balance of tax becomes payable because we feel that it is not right that the instalment provision should continue, as the taxpayer has, as it were, received an extra sum out of which he can pay the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given our basic view on the Bill, the Opposition do not quarrel with the amendment. We might comment that it expands paragraph 47 to twice its size. I believe the Minister said "extended". That is a euphemism for what the amendment actually does, but the two additional categories seem reasonable enough. A short time only has been available to us to study the provision, but with the help of the Notes and the Minister's speech, which his office was good enough to send us, after deliberation we have come to the view that there is nothing with which we basically quarrel, given the terms and objectives of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing I might say, in the context of the amendment, that here we have yet another notional value—the concept of "commercial rent" which is defined in Government Amendment No. 458. Although notional values have been part of the life that we have had to lead in the past 10 years, or 20 years in some cases, I cannot resist saying that the more notional or hypothetical taxation becomes—the whole Bill is based on a hypothetical set of values—the more difficult it is to draft legislation. I argue, indeed, that on this basis taxation becomes ever more absurd. Taxation should be based on ability to pay, upon having actually gained something with which to pay the tax.

The first case in which the instalment arrangement is terminated is if the lessor disposes of the reversion and thereby obtains cash in his pocket. I suppose that he could dispose of it for another lease, one superior to the lease about which the deferment has been made. Landlord A might wish to retain the freehold although he has let the property to tenant C. He therefore lets the property on a further lease to landlord B, so that we have A as the head landlord, B as the sub-landlord, and C as the tenant. The position between A and B will be exactly the same as it was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1503</span>
between B and C when the instalment arrangements were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems, therefore, that the instalment arrangements should not be cancelled in those circumstances. The original landlord who has the instalment arrangements is still receiving the proceeds of the disposal by instalments—that is, by a rent—and it seems that the instalment arrangement should therefore continue. If, of course, he received a premium for that intervening leasehold interest, I agree that the instalment arrangement should cease and he should be charged tax on the premium if it contains development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second case in which the instalment arrangement may be terminated is if the landlord, the original lessor, comes to an arrangement with the tenant for increasing the rent. I am not sure what the circumstances might be, but it might be that there is an extension of the premises or a change of use. If the landlord goes above what is called the commercial rent, I understand that the instalment arrangements are to cease. Surely this is a bit drastic? If he has not received a premium, or realised a lump sum out of which to pay the tax, he is really getting a little more rent. It might be, therefore, that the instalment arrangement should be quickened up and that he should pay larger instalments out of the rent that he receives, but it seems drastic to say that if he lets above the commercial rent the whole instalment arrangement ceases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are the two other cases which the Minister mentioned where the tax has been deferred, say, under Clause 26, and there is the grant of a lease—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are just two cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two cases, are there not? There is a disposal, and I think I see the point there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister said that the second case was where the deferred charge had been triggered off by something or other happening and that is followed by an actual disposal of the interest. Would these be two different events? Would it be triggered off by some other event? And if it is triggered off—this is not a phrase used in the Bill, but we have come to understand it in our debates—surely the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1504</span>
instalment arrangement is finished without waiting for another actual disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have misunderstood the Minister, or perhaps it has not sunk into my rather besotted mind—besotted by the words of the Bill, not by anything else—but we have the alternative for the instalment arrangement ceasing either by an actual disposal, whether it be a disposal by premium or something of that sort, or if it is a disposal by letting at a rent exceeding the commercial rent. I am concerned that in those circumstances the instalment arrangement becomes null and void although the lessor is not receiving his full amount of the proceeds of disposal and is receiving a rent in the same way as he was before. He is receiving a greater rent, and I should have thought the right thing to do was to say that there should be greater instalments, a fewer number of instalments, but the whole amount of tax should not be demanded right away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal first with those points. I believe the right hon. Gentleman spoke of there being no disposal of lease or reversion for a lump sum, but instead a disposal for another lease, so that what the reversioner is getting is in fact not cash, but another lease, which is another asset, being an exchange rather than a sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that case at the time the person has no money, but I should have thought it extremely difficult to provide in legislation that there should be a postponement of tax at that point in time, because the whole basis of the tax is that it is payable on a disposal, be it for cash or for another asset. I can think of splendid schemes whereby one could first of all dispose of the lease for another lease, and then sell it for cash, and in some way or other have the benefit of these instalment provisions. Although I see the right hon. Gentleman's point, I feel it would be expecting too much to be able to meet it within this kind of legislation without opening the door to considerable avoidance, so that a person who exchanges a lease for a lease does not pay, or get the benefit of the instalment provisions, and a person selling his lease for cash does not get the benefit either. A mere waltz of money or of leases could mean considerable benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was seeing the answer in my mind as I went along. Although the first arrangement for instalments is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1505</span>
defeated, the person is at liberty to come in and ask for another arrangement because he is creating a new lease; he is doing a disposal by a lease—albeit a head lease other than the one that he is disposing of. So I presume that even if it said that the instalment arrangement between landlord A and tenant C comes to an end one can ask for deferment of instalments between A and B.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can on the other one. Whether at the end of the day the taxpayer is better off, I do not know. But my basic point is that a disposal is a disposal, whether for cash or another asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point related to commercial rent, or rent above a commercial rent. The right hon. Gentleman asked why that should trigger off the full charge when someone may have received rent only slightly in excess of commercial rent. I must confess that I cannot think of a situation where rent would be received in excess of commercial rent where it was possibly not a premium. Without any commitment, I am prepared to look at that point to see what type of situation could be covered by it and whether there could be any problem. I shall not give a commitment because I do not know if it will be possible to meet such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point the right hon. Gentleman raised was about the trigger. My understanding of the triggering point here is that we are concerned with a situation where there is a figure of a deferred charge, not necessarily a receipt of any money on the trigger. For instance, if there is a development for industrial use and the property ceases to be used for industrial purposes, there is a trigger at that point, but the instalment provisions arise on that trigger, because the taxpayer has not received any money. If, later, there is a disposal and he receives money, the instalment provision comes to an end, so we are concerned first with the trigger, then with disposal and then with the termination of the instalments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope my reply goes some way to dealing with the points raised by the right hon. Gentleman. I shall look at the commercial rent aspect without commitment, but whether there would in practice be a problem I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 459, 460 and 461 are mainly drafting improvements to paragraph 48 of Schedule 8. The word "before" in line 12 is altered to "on", which is slightly more precise. The draftsmen on this Committee, amateur or otherwise, will be pleased that it is possible to be more precise by substituting the word "on" for the word "before". That would probably also apply for Scots law. Amendments Nos. 462, 463 and 464 are more substantial and I will explain briefly what they are intended to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of these amendments is to correct defects in sub-paragraphs (2), (4) and (5) of paragraph 48 of Schedule 8. As they stand, sub-paragraphs (2) and (4) refer to an 'appropriate fraction' which is defined in sub-paragraph (5). This formula does not give an appropriate result for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) if there is more than one subsequent disposal, each of which is a part disposal. This is because the numerator of the fraction is the aggregate of the net proceeds of each subsequent disposal, so that the fraction applied to the unpaid tax at successive stages is constantly growing. This would result in excessive amounts of tax becoming payable on second and subsequent disposals. To correct this, the fraction should be changed to net proceeds of subsequent disposal over net proceeds of original deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) is not here at present because at an earlier stage of our deliberations he expressed a desire to have more fractions in the Bill and here we are meeting his wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether I need to go on, I do not know, but if hon. Gentlemen wish, I shall read to the end of my note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the 'appropriate fraction' in sub-paragraph (5), broadly achieves the correct result for subparagraph (4), where it is applied to the 'added amount'—that is, an increase in the amount of the assessed tax which is made after the date of a subsequent disposal. To achieve a satisfactory overall result, separate formulae therefore have to be applied to sub-paragraphs (2) and (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the new formula for subparagraph (2) and the existing formula as
	<span class='label label-info column'>1508</span>
applied to sub-paragraph (4) should take account of the fact that the proceeds of each part disposal may reflect expenditure on improvements between the dates of the deemed and part disposals. For example, when an estate developer sells off his houses, the selling price of each house will include the building costs and will only partly reflect a realisation of the development value on which the DLT has been charged. To meet this point, the amendments provide that in each formula the net proceeds of the subsequent disposal, included in the numerator, should be reduced by the expenditure taken into account in determining the relevant base value of that interest on that disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will make it clear to the Committee that these amendments are designed to assist the taxpayer to some extent—at least in the latter part of the explanation. With regard to the first part, they are merely designed to make the Bill clearer and to provide that the appropriate fraction is applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 465 is purely a drafting amendment to simplify the text—as my hon. Friends will be pleased to hear—of paragraph 49(1) of the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's brilliantly illuminating explanation was well received, certainly by myself, who had the chance to read his notes beforehand, thanks to his private office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important amendment, as it happens, because there have been strong representations to the Government by various affected interests. The matter would have been avoided had it not become too simple, for the purposes of this Bill, to have merely had a formula which, in effect, said that if one had a part disposal, the tax borne by the part which was disposed should bear some simple proportion to the whole. That would have been a simple way of doing it. Instead of that, we are dealing—and if it was in order I would have been grateful to have had a blackboard to go into the matter further—with this incredible fraction which has on the top of the line, real part disposal and below the line, the imaginary deemed disposal. The fraction that that gives one is the basis upon which the tax was originally to be computed in the circumstances envisaged in this part of the schedule with part disposal circumstances.

5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, this was a serious situation because the bit above the line of a fraction which concerned the real element of part disposal did include within it all the costs of improvements and costs of development. Therefore, as he rightly pointed out, had the Bill remained in that way the fraction would have grown and grown until more than 100 per cent. had been reached well before the total disposal had occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome this amendment, and merely comment wryly and sadly that it could have been done in the first place so much more simply had we had a proper Bill which taxed things in their real sense, and taxed real disposals when they actually occurred, in a simple, straightforward way. It is a sad reflection upon the Bill that all this fuss and to-do has had to take place. But, given the circumstances and the nature of the Bill, the Minister's amendment was both right and even inevitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This amendment adds a further subparagraph to paragraph 48, which is concerned with the recalculation of instalments of DLT consequent upon disposals after a project of material development. The new subparagraph ensures that where liability to DLT has arisen on the commencement of a project of material development and the chargeable person has elected to pay the tax by instalments, the disposals of an assembly of land of which the project land forms part will trigger the payment of the balance of the tax being paid by instalments. If it were not for this amendment, the trigger would not work for a disposal of an assembly of land. We have not met our friend, "the assembly of land" for quite a considerable time, but I am sure hon. Gentlemen would agree that we would not want to leave the assembly out in the cold. We must bring the assembly into the trigger mechanism, and this is what we are doing in Amendment No. 300.

To that extent it is a drafting amendment, although of course it does extend the charge to the disposal of an assembly; but it is entirely logical within the context of the legislation.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 231, in page 161, line 30, leave out 'eighteen' and insert 'twelve'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with paragraph 50, which is a mopping-up operation for special circumstances where the right to pay instalments exist. These circumstances apply when the beneficiary is paid in instalments, and it is right that in those circumstances he should be permitted to pay the tax in instalments. The only point that we are arguing under this amendment is that, as found earlier in this kind of situation, the Bill is too restrictive and that it will harm the person who receives his payments in a period of less than 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have said—and it appears logical in terms of the instalment periods referred to earlier in the schedule—is that we should ask for a 12-month limit, rather than the 18-month limit. It is not the end of the world, but it might, in certain circumstances, help people who receive
	<span class='label label-info column'>1512</span>
payments in a period of between twelve and eighteen months. This amendment could be of some importance to those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of Amendment No. 231 is to reduce from eighteen to twelve months the period over which payment of the consideration must be spread before the taxpayer is able to request that the development land tax be paid by instalments on proof of undue hardship. The period of eighteen months has not been chosen entirely out of the air; it applies for capital gains tax purposes. It was decided then that eighteen months was the right period. It has always, in these cases, been a matter of judgment, and I could not stand here and say that eighteen months is perfect and twelve months is wholly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I think that eighteen months is not too long a period. When we go lower than eighteen months, the period is fairly short. Therefore, it is reasonable that we should adhere to eighteen months, although I agree that arguments could be produced either side of the line, especially as the capital gains tax treatment appears to have worked reasonably well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in the future, there are cases where the eighteen months creates considerable hardship, no doubt the matter will be reviewed. For capital gains tax purposes I believe that there has not been any representation to reduce the period from eighteen months. However, this is a different kind of tax, and the Revenue will keep it under review. For the time being, eighteen months is the best period to keep in, partly because of the capital gains tax provisions, and partly because eighteen months is not a particularly long period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In paragraph 50 on page 161 of the Bill, to which this amendment refers, we are specifically concerned with paragraph (
	<i>c</i>) which says that in addition to being able to establish that he is being paid in instalments the taxpayer has to show that he is suffering undue hardship. The operative word, in our view, is the "and" which appears at the end of line 31.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us—and this is the purpose of Amendment No. 232—that as long as he is being paid in instalments he should be allowed to pay the tax in this form as a right and should not have to go through yet a further qualifying test to show that he is suffering undue hardship. There is no necessity for that and, indeed, it would seem to pose another obstacle; yet another delaying factor for the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the Minister would see good reason for accepting the amendment. We merely want to wipe out subparagraph (
	<i>c</i>), which seems the best solution to a problem which to this type of taxpayer, could turn out to be another obstacle. This would ensure that he got his just desserts, because, if one pays in intalments, one should be allowed to pay tax in instalments.

Amendment No. 233 is a variant on that. It is not as significant. It does not really do the trick, but merely says that we should take out the words "undue hardship" Who is to say what is undue hardship? It is yet another obstacle to the taxpayer that he has to go through the hurdle of proving that it is undue hardship. He has to show not that he has a hard case, but a very hard case. As the word "undue" comes before "hardship", we think it is of special importance that we should abolish subparagraph (
	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue is important, and I should not like anything that I said earlier to cause the Minister to deny the fact that on this issue we feel very strongly. I hope, in fact, that he will feel as strongly as we do. Clearly, it is a matter that will help individuals without affecting the purport of the tax or, indeed, the purport of the exemption that is given under this part of the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with the provision in paragraph 50 which is intended to prevent undue hardship by permitting the spreading of payments of DLT in certain cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that we are not here concerned with the deemed disposal kind of situation which we have talked about previously. Where there is a disposal, the instalment provisions apply because it is unfair—I think this will be common ground anyway—that tax should be charged on the whole of that realised development value up to the point of the deemed disposal, so there are provisions in paragraph 43 for spreading the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here concerned with the situations that do not fall within those provisions and are not necessarily deemed disposals, but where the vendor and purchaser decide that the payment on the purchase money shall be payable by instalments over a period exceeding 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parentage of all this is the capital gains tax. Originally, under the capital gains tax legislation, it was possible to spread payments over a long period of time and avoid the payment of tax. As a result, the previous Conservative Government introduced Section 116 of the Finance Act 1972, which amended the provisions of the capital gains tax legislation to prevent widespread avoidance of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1515</span>
the tax by very long instalment provisions—sometimes over 1,000 years with little payable over that period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same problem could arise under this legislation if we did not provide that, subject to these exceptions about deemed disposals, payment by instalment was not sufficient to defer liability. Tax has to be paid de pite the fact that the purchaser does not get his money for a long time. This was debated earlier in Committee and the reason for it again was, purely, the avoidance problem which arose in the capital gains tax legislation. Into paragraph 50, therefore, there has been incorporated the same provisions as are included in the Finance Act 1972 relating to capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the meaning of the phrase "undue hardship" I accept that it is at the discretion of the Revenue to a considerable extent, and also that the word "undue" does not add much to "hardship". I am not sure what "undue hardship" means more than "hardship"—perhaps "very hardship" as has been said already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to read out to the Committee what the right hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin) said, during the Committee stage of the 1972 Finance Bill when he was Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In considering whether undue hardship would arise, the Revenue would look primarily to the question whether the vendor or disponer could reasonably be expected to pay the tax on the full amount immediately, in the light of the resources made available by the particular transaction involved. Regard would not normally be paid to the other resources of the taxpayer if it could be shown that the instalment arrangement was in the circumstances, and apart from any tax considerations, a normal commercial arrangement and reflected a genuine deferment of the enjoyment of the consideration. The Revenue practice would, of course, be kept under review, in the light of its effect on actual cases arising."—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E;</i> 22nd June 1972; Vol. 8, c. 1358–9.]</p></blockquote>
I recognise that it is not entirely satisfactory that an administrative body like the Board of the Inland Revenue should determine these matters but, again, we do not live in a perfect world and it is not possible always to draw lines perfectly between one situation and another. In practice, it has worked reasonably well in relation to capital gains tax, and I do not think that it will work differently in respect of this tax for development land. Indeed, it is more important to have this kind of provision in the Bill because, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>1516</span>
the right hon. Gentleman keeps on redminding us, DLT is at a higher rate and a higher level, and it is most important that provisions about undue hardship should be contained in the legislation. If the right hon. Gentleman wanted the word "undue" out, I should not object all that much, but I think it preferable to let it remain, although at the end of the day it will not make that much difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stress that we are not concerned with the ordinary deemed disposals situation; that is in the legislation on a statutory basis. Here we are concerned with the difficulty of avoidance and the fact that there was widespread avoidance, unfortunately, and this is what avoidance leads to. Nobody likes this kind of situation. The Government does not like it and the Revenue does not like it. Unfortunately, provision has to be made for it, and that is why the provisions about undue hardship appear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee not to accept the amendments. Obviously, the situation will be kept under review and, if there are difficulties in future, the practice and procedure will be reviewed, but at the moment I think it will work reasonably well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate as the Minister has said, that there is a parentage to this clause—Section 116 of the Finance Act 1972. In putting this amendment it is difficult to make the distinction between capital gains tax and development land tax merely on the question of the time for payment although, as the Minister said, this is a tax at a higher rate, likely to involve greater sums than capital gains tax, and the hardship point may arise more frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood the Minister's description of hardship, whether it is simple hardship—though I do not know what simple hardship might be—or undue hardship, it is financial hardship. I suppose there is no hardship that does not arise out of financial hardship. It was some comfort to me to know that this is construed as being a hardship without reference to other resources, assets and income of the chargeable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether this comes entirely within the amendment—at any rate it will save asking the question on "schedule stand part"—but these hardship provisions apparently do not apply to a disposal to an exempt body. Does the exempt body, in deducting the tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1517</span>
from the purchase money, have to give consideration to these provisions? Let me put it another way. The Board cannot give consideration to making assessment. The exempt body cannot give consideration in deducting the specified amoutt or applying the formula. So there is no relief in those circumstances of an acquisition by an exempt body to the chargeable person. I may have missed something in the provisions of the schedule which provides for that but, at the moment, I do not see how the exempt body takes into account whether there is any undue hardship to the chargeable person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Jenkin) referred to the fact that the definition given in the 1972 Act does not make references to other aspects of the taxpayer's income. That seems to suggest that the word "undue" is even more irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the thrust of the Minister's argument about deleting the entire subparagraph (
	<i>c</i>), and if it plugs a possible loophole, then so be it. But I still maintain that the word "undue" gives to the Revenue yet another card to play against the taxpayer. If the hardship relates merely to this particular transaction and not to other aspects of his revenue, the word "undue" is even more irrelevant and an unnecessary obstacle or debating point between the Revenue and the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important point that this tax is a different tax. It is different on two counts: first, because it is such a high-rate tax and, secondly, because it is a totally different type of tax in kind. One cannot use the argument that because the words appear in different taxes they can be copied out into the Bill without any additional reasoning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister may not be willing to accept Amendment No. 232, I ask him to think carefully about Amendment No. 233 and reconsiders the word "undue", as he indicated that he was prepared to do. I think it would be little help to the taxpayer to know that all he had to prove was hardship, and that the word "undue"—I think the Minister recognises this—which could be a debating point and lead to further frustration and delay, could be taken out of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1518</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to correct any false impression I may have given. I did not intend to give the impression that I would consider taking the word "undue" out. What I said was that I did not really think that it made all that much difference. Since it is in the capital gains tax legislation, I suggest that it would just add to the confusion if it was taken out here. I do not think that it prejudices the taxpayer in any way, and for the same of consistency we should keep it in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), raised the question of net of tax payments. In a rare case, if the local authority paid the consideration by instalments, I am advised that DLT deduction would be made proportionately in respect of each instalment. We are therefore in a slightly different situation from a private sale, where the parties agree to pay by instalments and the DLT charge arises immediately without account being taken of the fact that the payments are made by instalments. In the case of a purchase by a local authority, if the purchase is by instalments, the net of tax deduction comes out of the instalments. To that extent, it is a different situation, although in the end the whole of the tax will be payable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I did not make myself clear. If the vendor, who is selling to the local authority, were selling to a private individual, he would receive the full purchase price. He would then apply to the Board to say that it would be undue hardship for him to have to pay the full tax at once, and would ask to pay by instalments. But if he is selling to an exempt body, that exempt body will deduct 100 per cent. tax right away. It must do that, according to the Bill. It is obliged to take the specified amount of the assessment, or it is obliged to take the formula amount. There does not seem to be anything in the Bill that would prevent that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee all sorts of difficulties here. Under the procedure adopted in the Bill, there does not seem to be any possibility of giving relief to someone who suffers hardship in those circumstances, unless the Board is prepared to pay the full tax over to the local authority and collect it by instalments from the vendor. If the Board is prepared to be generous enough to do that, that is fine, but I cannot see how the undue hardship of a vendor will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1519</span>
be relieved in the case of a sale to an exempt body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may come back on that point. We compare like with like. In the kind of case where the purchase price, in a sale between private persons, is payable by instalments, tax is chargeable immediately, but it is possible for the vendor to ask that undue hardship be taken into account. If we had the same kind of sale by a local authority, or an exempt body, again where the purchase price is payable by instalments, at least the net of tax provision applies proportionately to the instalments, and the whole amount does not have to be deducted immediately by the local authority. That is the point I was trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that under paragraphs 5(
	<i>a</i>) and 6(2) of the new Schedule 7 provisions, the deduction can be spread where the consideration is spread. If the consideration is by instalments, the deduction is also spread, although I must admit that I am not quite sure when the Revenue gets its full amount of tax. I am not sure whether it waits until the spreading is completed and then raises an assessment. Perhaps I would like notice of my own question. With regard to the right hon. Gentleman's question, however, I think that I have given him some kind of answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government Amendments Nos. 301 and 302 are to bring the wording of paragraphs 53(1) and 54(1) of Schedule 8 into line with paragraph 54(4) and (5) and to ensure that when DLT is assessed and charged on a beneficiary under a trust, or one one of a group of companies, following the failure of the trustees or the chargeable company to pay the tax, no regard need be paid to the second person's entitlement to the £10,000 exemption or the lower rate tranche.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a collection machinery, as hon. Gentlemen will remember. Where a trustee does not pay the tax, there is provision to get the tax out of the beneficiary. This is not unusual in fiscal legislation. Again, in the case of a group of companies, where the chargeable company fails to pay the tax, there is provision to get the tax out of another company in the group which is treated as on unit. The Government's amendments merely provide and ensure that the person who is secondarily liable for a primary liability cannot claim an extra £10,000 exemption, or cannot claim an extra lower rate tranche. It is merely a question of liability. He cannot claim his own tranche and exemption. He is merely satisfying the liability of a primary person—be it the trustee or the chargeable company—which has failed to pay the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1521</span>
tax. Hon. Gentlemen would agree that it would not be right that he should get his own exemption in relation to that liability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised by the eminent authorities who have been advising us on this Bill that one of their number was approached by the Government the other day and was told: "You are so good that when we go into the Opposition the next time, could you perhaps help us?" At which point he said, "Well, it depends on what sort of legislation comes forward".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that Government Amendment No. 301 has the possible effect of proposing that every beneficiary in a settlement should pay the whole of DLT, even if there is only a part interest in a trust or settlement. The purpose of our Amendment No. 449 is to restrict the proportion of this tax to the proportion of a beneficiary's interest in the settlement. The Government may say that there is no need for an amendment but we would like to be assured that there is no need for it. It would clearly be absurd if there was this drafting problem in the amendment as it now affects the Bill but, as I say, we have been advised from the highest authorities that there is a doubt left in the Bill, as amended, and for this reason we would be grateful to have the Government's comments on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 449 would seek to limit the DLT recoverable from a beneficiary on the default of a trustee or personal representative to the proportion which the proportion of the assets transferred to him bears to his total interest in the settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has said that he is concerned that the beneficiary might have to pay more tax than he should under paragraph 53 of Schedule 8. Paragraph 53, as I implied, is aimed at giving the Revenue alternative powers of recovery if trustees or personal representatives upon whom DLT is assessed fail to pay and transfer the interest in land in question to an absolute beneficiary. It provides for tracing through and recovery of the DLT from the beneficiary. I hope that this gives the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he is seeking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the beneficiary has received only part of the consideration, his liability is restricted proportionately under subparagraph (3) of paragraph 53. So whatever
	<span class='label label-info column'>1522</span>
the hon. Gentleman's advisers may say, the Inland Revenue is satisfied, and the draftsman is satisfied, that sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 53 restricts the liability to part of the consideration; proportionately he has only received part of the consideration. In other words, he does not pay the whole amount of the consideration if he has only received part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman wished me to deal with the amendment, which, of course, goes much wider than that. It seeks to apportion in relation to all the assets of the settlement and, of course, the assets to the settlement may contain assets other than land. It would not, in fact, be acceptable to apportion for all the assets of the settlement. The point I want to make is that there is no question here that tax will only be paid on part of the consideration if that is what the beneficiary has, in fact, received. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very difficult to argue when the Minister puts forward the fact that the draftsman is perfectly satisfied that the beneficiary will not suffer tax on any more than the amount which he has received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the point perfectly well that if the trustees fail to pay the tax and they pass the proceeds over to the beneficiary, of course the beneficiary should be made chargeable. I hope I am on the right lines. They are lines 10 to 12 on page 163 and I will go back to line 6, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, the person referred to in paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) above may at any time within the period of two years beginning with the date when the tax became payable be assessed and charged (in the name of the trustees or personal representatives) to…"</p></blockquote>
We then add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all or any part of that tax."</p></blockquote>
To all or any part. Not just the tax on the amount transferred to him, unless I have not read back far enough. Certainly, the words "all or" seem to indicate that he could be treated as a sort of joint tenant of the proceeds or a partner in the proceeds and be assessed for the tax on the whole of the proceeds, even if he personally is only entitled to a part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As interest runs from the reckonable date three months after the chargeable occasion, whether or not the tax becomes payable following the making of an assessment, it would be unreasonable not to give a company which has the right to recover from another the tax it has paid, a clear right also to recover the associated interest.

So this again deals with the case where there has been a failure by one company in the group to pay the tax and another company has to pay it.

It would otherwise not be proper to give the company the right to recover that interest.

The person paying the tax may recover the tax and any interest from the chargeable company. The amendment closely follows the equivalent provisions of Section 266 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, which is concerned with the recovery from a shareholder of corporation tax attributable to chargeable gains which a company has failed to pay. The expression "connected with the chargeable company" will be construed in accordance with Section 533 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without a provision such as this amendment, it would be possible for a closely-controlled company—and we are here dealing with close companies, that is companies controlled by five or fewer persons, or whatever the definition is—to distribute the proceeds of disposal of an interest in land to its shareholders and then go into liquidation, leaving the liquidator with insufficient assets to pay the DLT on the disposal. This amendment will provide what is already provided for capital gains tax, that the Inland Revenue could go against a connected person in relation and proportionately to the amount of capital distribution relating to that gain which the connected person had received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it is a proportionate matter. If the connected person receives a chunk
	<span class='label label-info column'>1526</span>
of money out of the company which is related to that gain, and if the company has failed to pay the tax, the Revenue can trace through, as it were, and charge the connected person, that is, the person connected with the company—and "a connected person" is a specific term which is defined in Section 533. We are concerned here with close companies and we are concerned with the avoidance point, that a company could be liquidated, the assets distributed and when the Revenue got there the cupboard would be bare and there would be nothing with which to pay the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister gave us the assurance that this only applies to close companies. I found a little difficulty in tracing that in the amendment itself, but I will certainly take his word for it. I do not want to wade through the actual wording to that extent. Is there any limit on the period of time for which a claim can be made in this case against the shareholder to whom the proceeds have been distributed because it may well be that the shareholder will not realise, will not know in the winding up of the company that he has in his hands money out of which tax should be paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that in most cases of a close company going into liquidation, it should be well known to those who receive the proceeds, the liabilities of that company. Normally, they will know in such a company, a close company, that the company will be owing something in the tax. But I imagine that this will occur frequently in liquidations. Is that not so? The company, in the course of liquidation, will sell some land with development value. The money goes into the accounts and it may be at that stage that the shareholder who is to receive some of the proceeds merely takes the accounts showing realisation of the assets, and does not realise that he may be liable to the tax. If he does not know, it may be many years afterwards that he finds he has this liability through receiving some notice from the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather there is no obligation on the person receiving the proceeds in that way to give any notice to the Board. Or does he have to include it in his returns for tax? But it is putting a burden on the individual to know a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1527</span>
detail of the law which even the Minister himself, with all his advisers, has only just realised ought to be in the Bill. It is rather hard on an individual to expect him to know the law to the extent that he may have money in his hands on which tax is payable. So the point is, can the Board come down on him at any time, or is there some period during which the claim must be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without having advice, I think the answer is that the normal time limits would apply; it would be six years in a normal case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I was talking, my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) spotted a line in the amendment which refers to a period of two years, beginning with the date on which the tax became payable, in which to be assessed and charged and so on. So it seems that the Board has to make an assessment within two years of liquidation, and if that is so, it is very satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it within two years of liquidation, or the time at which the company became liable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure. Perhaps I can wait for advice, but clearly six years was wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I return to another point which perhaps was not entirely clear? I said that these would be close companies. I am advised that they need not necessarily be strictly close companies, but the shareholder has to be connected with them, as in Section 533 of the Corporation Taxes Act 1970. So there could be situations where the companies were not close companies but the shareholders would be connected with them for the purposes of that section. I should have thought that in 99 per cent. of cases they would be close companies, although I do not wish to mislead the Committee. They might not be in some cases, but the shareholder might still be connected and have some control or close contact with the company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that makes the problem a little worse because the connected person may be someone who does not know about the company at all. This is another example of the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>1528</span>
saying, "When did you last ask your father about his accounts? When did he last leave the accounts lying about?" Because in many cases the connected person is part of a young family—to say nothing of a wife. My recollection is that the relatives of directors are connected persons, and it may well be that the connected persons are quite remote from the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it may solve the problem a little if the assessment can be made within a short period of time, and, if the matter we dealt with previously about payment by instalments where there is undue hardship can be coupled with the assessment, that may make the clause not quite so bad as it seemed when the Minister was last speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can redeem myself even further. It is two years from the date of the primary charge on the company, not merely the date of distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point about connected persons. Although, of course, it may not necessarily be a close company, a person is connected with a company in Section 533 if he has control of the company or if he and the person connected with him is controlling the company. So we are not talking here about a person who has very little connection with the company but about a person who himself, or with other connected persons—I accept that they include members of his family—has control of the company. So we are talking about control, and control of the liquidator and the way liquidation is carried out. I think that that is the main answer to the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are provisions now where liquidators have to pay tax in a liquidation—capital gains tax. They have to make sure that they have the money and enough of it to pay profits tax. What must be ensured here is that they keep the money to pay development land tax, and the amendment is aimed against tax avoidance, against a situation where the liquidator distributes, winds up the company and there is nothing left to pay the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a drafting amendment, which reflects the form of words used in paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 7 following Amendment No. 406. The words "for the time being" acknowledge that the prescribed rate may be varied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite obvious that these words add nothing whatever to the sense of the subsection as it stands. Either something is the prescribed rate or it is not the prescribed rate. It is not a question of "is for the time being" the prescribed rate. If it is a question of getting it on all fours with some other provision of the Bill, surely the proper amendment would be to delete the words "for the time being" in that other part of the Bill in order to get them on all fours in a shorter version. As a matter of hard fact, these words add absolutely nothing whatever to the meaning of the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the schedule, as amended, be the Eighth Schedule to the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have come a long way on the schedule on our last night. We must have spent about six hours looking at it, and we have gone over it fairly well. However, there are two small points I should like to raise, one of which was raised earlier and the other was that I omitted to move one of our amendments, Amendment No. 448.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is a point of some substance, and I wonder whether I can turn the Minister's mind to it. It concerns page 147. The main issue here is that we are talking about the notice period required within which notice of material development has to be given. Paragraph 36(1) (
	<i>b</i>) states that it must not be later than 30 days after that date. But it may take longer through some kind of a mistake, but more probably because there is some doubt as to whether the particular project falls under the terms of material development as defined under the Bill, and whether it affects more than 10 per cent. of the cubic content of the building. There might be some element of doubt about it, and some argument between the taxpayer and the Revenue. Because of that, the notice period might be missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we proposed to add the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1530</span>
amendment which I should have moved, and I apologise for not moving it. This would have allowed the general commissioners or special commissioners to be made present, to have an appeal made against them if it seemed to be that some extra time was required beyond the 30 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to discuss that amendment, but we think that some form of appeal procedure against the thirty day limit should be incorporated into the Bill where, through no fault of an individual, there is some argument about whether the thing is a material development in terms of the definitions of the Bill and whether it falls outside the 10 per cent. restriction on cubic content. At the margin, there may well be this kind of argument. We ask that some element of flexibility be introduced at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point I make is one to which I have referred before and on which we have not yet had a proper answer. It comes back to the matter of the interest payable on the tax which has not been paid. We contend, as we have done throughout the last several hours, that this is an important matter. The Minister, however, says that it is not. I ask, once again, why it is that we fine within this schedule something called the "due date" as being either the reckonable date, or the date of expiry of the period of thirty days, beginning with the date of issue of the notice of assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is accepted as the due date, why can it not be accepted at least as the basis from which unpaid tax should bear interest? The Bill itself says that that is the due date and, if that is the case, why cannot it be the date upon which the interest on unpaid tax is assessed? It is a simple point which relates directly to the terms of the Bill, as currently specified in this schedule. When he comes to reply, I ask the Minister not to give the answer which he gave before to this important point of logic within the Bill. I ask him to address his mind to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say here and now that I have about 10 questions to ask the Minister and I apologise, in advance, for putting them now and not raising them on amendments. To that extent, no doubt the Minister would like to get advice on some of them, although I know that he knows the Bill backwards, but you may then think that it is time for your
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1531</span>
chop, Mr. Crawshaw. However, we will try not to proceed to a vote tonight on the schedule as a whole if I put these questions now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I refer to page 142 of the schedule, where it is quite clear that an agent or branch of a company—and I am not sure what it means by "branch"—is to be assessed to tax for the amount due from a non-resident person. It is unfair to require an agent to meet the tax of a non-resident unless that agent has, in his hands, the funds which belong to the non-resident from whom he can make payment. This may well be going back to Clause 39, but it does not appear from that clause that a mere agent may be made liable for tax. The selling agent, for example, who may have received only the deposit, may never receive the full proceeds of the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the Minister to look at this point. As the provision stands it is new Section 85A, set out on page 142, which raises this point. So far as trustees, the guardian, the tutor, the curator or committee and so on and other people mentioned in those cases are concerned, it naturally follows that only the funds in their hands will be there to meet the liability of the non-resident. It is not clear when it is just the agent, as he is the person who is to be assessed under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is on page 143, in line 36. For tax purposes, we know that it was contended, last year I think, that the remitting of interest under £10 should be at the discretion of the Inland Revenue, as income tax could be payable under a number of different assessments. Although the interest on each might be under £10, the total interest on the tax payable for the year of assessment could exceed £10. Similar problems are unlikely to arise with development land tax. Therefore, there seems to be little justification for giving the Board discretion as it would have under the provisions on page 143, in line 37, where it says "if the Board thinks fit…" I do not think the income tax position follows here. We have been told that this is a separate sort of tax and is dealt with separately throughout the Bill to any other form of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to page 144, paragraph 24. Where a person has overpaid—for example, capital gains tax—but owes the Inland
	<span class='label label-info column'>1532</span>
Revenue income tax, he can say to the Inland Revenue that, instead of repaying the overpayment of capital gains tax to him, it should use it to satisfy the income tax liability so that he does not incur interest on the overdue income tax, the sort of interest which we have been discussing so much in the amendments to this schedule. Paragraph 24 provides that an overpayment of development land tax cannot be set against an amount due to the Inland Revenue in respect of income tax or capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the nonsense of the Inland Revenue having to hand over tax with one hand and then try to get it back with the other, with all the expense and bureaucracy that that involves, there seems to be no logical reason why a person should not be able to ask the Board to use the money in their hands to offset another liability duty. I cannot see the point of paragraph 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to a point which was touched upon by my hon. Friend, the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer). I call the Minister's attention to the period for giving a notice under paragraph 36(1)(
	<i>b</i>), on page 147. The notice has to be given:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not later than thirty days after that date,…"</p></blockquote>
That time limit for notifying the Inland Revenue seems to be very unrealistically short. Small developers—those who are not always carrying out large developments—are likely to be unaware of their obligation and although their solicitors or accountants may be well aware of this obligation, these professional men are likely not to know when the development starts. I should not like to be under an obligation to watch the site of clients of mine to see when they start the development, and see that they get their notices within 30 days. It is a short period of time. As the Minister will know, a period of 12 months is normally allowed to a taxpayer to notify the Revenue that he is chargeable to tax, and there seems no reason for giving such a very short period in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important matter which arises out of that, turning to paragraph 40, is the incidence of penalties. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South touched on this. If that notice is not given within those 30 days—and on the face of it I do not see any possibility for an extension of that time—the unfortunate taxpayer may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1533</span>
become liable for very substantial penalties under paragraph 40. I want to call the Ministers attention to the fact that paragraph 40 is far more severe than corresponding sections on penalties in the Taxes Management Act 1970. Normally, under that Act, the penalties arise when a person fails to comply with a notice. There are special cases in which the penalties arise even if no notice of his default has been given to him, but certainly, under Section 93, the main section on income tax and capital gains tax in the Act, the penalty clause starts by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any person has been required by notice served…".</p></blockquote>
I agree that penalties might reasonably follow if the chargeable person has received a notice, has been made well aware of his defaults and has failed to comply with that notice. Half the point of the penalties and the severity of them under this Bill are that the failure does not have to be a wilful failure or a failure with intent to defraud; it is just a failure to give notice. If that notice has to be given within 30 days, then it will cause very considerable hardship on the chargeable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, in relation to this period of time in which matters have to be done, I call the Minister's attention to paragraph 40(2)(
	<i>b</i>), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the failure continues after the end of the period of six months beginning on the last day on which the notice might have been given in accordance with that paragraph …"</p></blockquote>
the person is subject to a penalty which can go up to £5,000. Apparently, he becomes subject to that or to the overriding maximum penalty, so the penalty can start to run before he has received any notice of default, or notice requiring him to make any return, and it is a very severe penalty if it is to fall on the person who is not fraudulent but perhaps rather slack in making the returns. He can be caught later if he is fraudulent, and paragraph 41 states "fraudulently or negligently", which I feel goes quite a long way, but I will admit that it follows the wording of the Taxes Management Act 1970. I am not trying to excuse the man who is fraudulent. I am not even trying to excuse the man who is negligent. I am trying to excuse the man who has merely failed to give notices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Schedule 8 as drafted, where a development is commenced the notice has to be given by any person having an
	<span class='label label-info column'>1534</span>
interest in the land. If more than one person gives the notice, the one who gives the notice first will be treated as having given the effective notice. The interest of a developer, a freeholder and a leaseholder in one piece of land may not always be identical, and it seems unfair that whichever is quickest off the mark in giving in the notice should be able to determine the extent of the project and thus, possibly, the extent of the tax liability to other people interested in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, the parties will all be involved together and give the notice jointly, or at least the rest will know what the notice-giver has sent in. But that may not be the case. They may all mutually agree on the project, but it may be that they are acting separately. I think the Minister should look at the position where one party, it may well be in dispute with others who have an interest in the land, gives the notice and in some form binds the others by having been the first to give that notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one small point at the top of page 149 to which I want to draw attention. It covers the exemption from giving these notices. Paragraphs 37(2) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) above shall require notice to be given of a disposal if—"</p></blockquote>
Under this paragraph, (
	<i>c</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the disposal is not a part disposal;"</p></blockquote>
and (
	<i>d</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the consideration for the disposal does not exceed £25,000."</p></blockquote>
From that, I understand that notice would have to be given for a part-disposal no matter what the value of the property may be. I know that here we are dealing with consideration for the disposal, but as the provision stands, if a landowner were to sell off one corner of his land for £10 and the whole of his land is worth £15,000, he would have to give notice of that sale of £10. But if it were the sale of the whole of his land for £15,000, he would not have to give notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a practical point, and I am sure that the Revenue does not want to be burdened by people giving notice about small bits of part-disposal. I ask the Minister to find some solution to it both from the Revenue's point of view of being over-burdened with notices, and from the taxpayer's point of view in that if he does not give notice of selling off a corner of land for £10, he may well be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1535</span>
liable for a fine of £5,000. I may be taking an extreme example but it certainly comes within the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful, Mr. Crawshaw, for having the Committee listen to me on these points which members did not have a chance to see on amendments but, as I think everyone appreciates, this is a schedule of great complexity. We tried to spot the points on which we could put down amendments and give the Minister good warning, but there are bound to be points such as those I have raised now and which we did not spot earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
