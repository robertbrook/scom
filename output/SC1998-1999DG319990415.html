	<div class='legislation'>Draft General Teaching Council for Wales (Constitution) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Charles Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft General Teaching Council for Wales (Constitution) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft General Teaching Council for England (Constitution) Regulations 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall say a word about general background. From September 2000, the general teaching councils for England and Wales will provide an independent and authoritative voice for teachers and work with the Government and others to raise standards. Teachers will have a major role in regulating their profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GTCs will advise the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales on a wide range of teaching issues, including recruitment, supply, initial training, induction, professional development and conduct. Like other professional bodies, the GTCs will develop and consult on a code of professional conduct and practice for registered teachers. They will maintain a register of qualified teachers and will have powers to strike off teachers for serious professional misconduct or incompetence. The GTCs must be separate bodies with a distinctive professional voice, not a collection of existing interests. Each will be a teaching council and not a teachers' council—a GTC will not be a super-union or a talking shop, but a professional body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In common with other professional bodies, the GTCs are likely to set a modest annual registration fee of about £20 a year, which is the fee charged by the General Teaching Council for Scotland. I pay tribute to the work done in Scotland on this matter over many years. The Government will fund the initial start-up period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide detail that was not provided when the Bill that became the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 was debated early last year. We wanted to proceed through dialogue and consultation and to ensure wide discussion with the various relevant interests on issues that needed to be addressed. We wished to achieve a balance between wide consultation and ensuring the full right of Parliament to scrutinise key aspects of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I should make it clear that I am speaking on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales to present to the Committee regulations that will govern the composition of the general teaching council for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will provide GTCs with a good mix of experience, commitment and expertise. They will ensure that the GTCs command the respect of teachers, parents, teachers' employers, the general public and the many organisations with which they will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 3 of the regulations affecting England deals with the size of the GTC. The main change that we made after consultation was to increase its size to 64 members. The change was necessary to accommodate important additional interests not represented in the original proposals, including those of chief education officers and equal opportunities groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Theresa May 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say 64 members or 63? The Regulation refers to 63.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said 64, and I was just about to explain why the regulation refers to 63. The change was necessary to accommodate important additional interests not included in the original proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just showing that I am awake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is always awake, sharp and alert, and she is an example to the whole opposition, in contrast to the shadow Secretary of State. The change accommodates the interests of other parties, including chief education officers and equal opportunities groups. Once the disability rights commission is established, I intend to make it one of the equal opportunities groups able to appoint a member. Until that time, the regulations provide for only 63 GTC members; that is the answer to the hon. Lady's question. In keeping with the Government's commitment to retain a majority of teachers on the general teaching council for England, the number of teachers was also increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 9 of the regulations affecting England requires the Secretary of State to ensure that at least two of his or her appointees represent the interests of pupil's parents. It also ensures that, when deciding whom to appoint, he has regard to the desirability of the GTCs membership reflecting the interests of the general public and of teachers of pupils with special education needs. The Secretary of State is therefore required to take account of those specific interests in deciding on his or her nominees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that point, will he tell us why it has not been possible to state how parents will be chosen, how the interests of children with special educational needs will be represented and why specific representative groups have not been included in the regulations, rather than leaving appointments to be made later by the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We gave a great deal of thought to those two important points. We felt that it was difficult to decide what was the appropriate national representative body or structure through which parents' representatives might find their way on to the general teaching council. In England, for example, it is not clear what representative structure could be established to ensure that two parents to be appointed were representative of the whole. Some people have argued for the inclusion of particular national organisations for parents, but, as the hon. Gentleman will probably concede, it would be difficult to suggest that—at this stage, at any rate—they were genuinely representative across the range.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are proposals to establish a more general structure—for example, by bringing the parent-governors of schools in a particular local education authority together into one structure, and through that building up an England-wide structure that could in some sense be representative. However, as I hope that the hon. Gentleman will concede, we are not yet at that stage, and it would have been previous to suggest that we rely on such a structure before it existed. We are considering ways to develop more effective representative structures, which could be taken into account later. If they are established, either the regulations could be changed or the Secretary of State could state that he or she would make his or her nomination taking that structure into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I detect from that answer that the Secretary of State will not appoint anyone because there is no way to decide which parents should sit on the council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the specific obligation on the Secretary of State set out in regulation 9 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State shall ensure that two or more of those members represent the interests of parents of pupils."</p></blockquote>
Parents interests are important, but I acknowledge the truth of the hon. Gentlemans point that at this stage the Secretary of State cannot turn to organisation X, Y or Z and say in April 1999 that it is the authentic voice of parents. That is why we have framed the regulations as we have. However, it is of course important to develop representative structures for parents; the Government are committed to that course, but it is a long and complicated process starting from where we are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the same level of detail in relation to special educational needs, but similar issues arise in that area, as they do in some other constituencies that felt that they should be represented. We felt that, instead of defining a series of bodies to nominate where it is not certain that they could authoritatively be regarded as representative, we should channel nomination through the Secretary of State. That is the process set out in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let me make it clear that as and when different channels emerge that are seen to command the respect of people across the range of particular interests, we are open to considering different forms of nomination—either in regulations or in guidance
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
operated by the Secretary of State—to take account of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the composition of the general teaching council, the regulations deal with a number of constitutional issues. Briefly, those include regulation 4, which deals with the electoral constituencies for different types of teacher; regulation 5, which deals with which teachers will be entitled to stand for election; regulation 6, which concerns the electoral scheme for teacher elections, which is to be made for the first set of elections, which we expect to be held in spring 2000, by the Secretary of State; regulation 10, which sets the terms of office of members of the general teaching council; and, finally, regulation 12, which relates to the chairman of the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, the Secretary of State may nominate the initial chairman of the council. We had not intended to follow that course in England, and the English regulations reflect that. However, we are reconsidering that position, because we are anxious that during the period before the general teaching council is elected—and shortly thereafter, before it can make its own first appointment of a chairman—there should be a spokesperson for the general teaching council, to develop the debate. We are actively reconsidering the appointment of the initial chair of the council, consulting a range of bodies, and we may seek to amend the regulations on that point. I believe that it is right to mention that in introducing the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On choosing the first chairperson, can the Minister confirm that, once the transfer of functions to the Assembly has occurred, the Assembly—or, perhaps, in effect, the secretary for education in the Assembly—will fulfil the functions described in the regulations as being those of the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that for Wales. My earlier remarks about our reconsideration specifically related to the general teaching council for England. At present, we are actively considering the timetable for the general teaching council for England, and I hope that we shall shortly be able to address that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations for Wales cover the same issues as those for England. The main changes made following consultation are that explicit provision has been made to secure that continued teacher member majority, and that four of the nine members to be appointed from nominations by relevant organisations will be from teacher unions and associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In finalising the arrangements, we have sought to build on the widespread consensus about the composition of the councils. We know that we cannot satisfy everyone's demand for a seat on the council—to do so would make the councils unwieldy and cumbersome—but I hope that we have got the balance right in the regulations. The constitutional arrangements are modest and in keeping with our view that, wherever possible, the general teaching councils will be best placed to decide their own arrangements. There is a difficult balance to be achieved in the initial period between prescribing a lot—which would mean
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
that the councils could not decide much because we would have already taken the decisions—and not deciding anything, which would mean that the councils had a slow running start. We hope that we have got that difficult judgment right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general teaching councils will have a challenging and exciting future, and I hope that the regulations are a key step to securing their membership. I hope that the Committee will approve the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.12 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first say what a pleasure it is to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham? I think that it is the first time that I have had that pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are indeed important. They establish the membership and constitution of a new body to be set up by the Government, about which there has been much debate. I must tell the Minister that we remain concerned that the Government are missing an opportunity in the way that they have chosen to set up the general teaching council. The Minister has outlined the council's powers, including the power to strike a teacher from the register for incompetence. It must be said that those powers were not initially envisaged by the Government when they proposed the council; its powers were considerably strengthened by interventions made in another place by my noble Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome that strengthening of the council, but remain concerned that it may fall between two stools and fail to be the body of and for the teaching profession, regulating the teaching profession by the teaching profession, which it could and should be. We prefer to compare it with the royal medical colleges, which are powerful bodies determining not only standards for but entry to those professions. The council will not undertake mat role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to specific points about the regulations. I shall concentrate my comments on the general teaching council for England, but I should like to ask the Minister questions about it in comparison with the general teaching council for Wales. Regulation 4 concerns the different categories of elected members. It specifies a number of teachers of senior and junior pupils, one head teacher from a secondary school and one from a primary school, and one teacher from a special school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to see the inclusion of a teacher from a special school. I noted the Minister's comments about the Secretary of State's freedom to appoint further members to the GTC with relevant experience of special educational needs, and I hope that the Secretary of State ensures that more such people are indeed appointed. Why was it not considered appropriate to provide for more than one teacher from a special
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
school in regulation 4? Have the Government given any thought to ensuring representation from the different types of special needs education? As we know, requirements vary considerably in that sector, and it is important that it is properly represented. All too frequently, it gets somewhat left out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the balance of elected members, there will be 23 teachers and two head teachers. I want to draw a comparison with the general teaching council regulations for Wales, because regulation 4 of the latter provides for eight teachers and four heads or deputy heads. The balance between classroom teachers and head teachers is therefore quite different in Wales from what it will be in England. Why was it felt appropriate for the two sets of regulations to be different in that respect? Will two head teachers be sufficient for a proper balance within the general teaching council for England?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make some technical points on the categorisation of senior pupils and junior pupils. The definitions are set out in regulation 2. A senior pupil is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person who has attained the age of 12".</p></blockquote>
Presumably, any middle school is therefore categorised as comprising junior pupils rather than secondary pupils. A junior pupil is defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a child who has not attained the age of 12".</p></blockquote>
Will teachers of junior pupils therefore include teachers working in nursery units or separate nursery schools? By that definition they will be included, but it would help if the Minister confirmed that on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for jumping about between regulations, but I now turn to the process of the elections. I note that the initial elections will be held on the basis of a system decided by the Secretary of State, thereafter changing to a system decided by the general teaching council, which is entirely appropriate. Although regulation 6 (4) prescribes that elections should be held every four years, it makes no reference to the period over which an election should be held. I am not sure whether the Minister envisages hustings across the country for the election of teachers to the general teaching council. What process does he expect to go on among the 450,000 teachers to ensure that 23 of them are elected as representatives of the teaching profession on that body?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that regulation 7 provides that nine members be appointed by the teaching trade unions. The explanatory notes to the regulations state that those will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"9 teachers appointed by organisations representing teachers".</p></blockquote>
In fact, the regulations themselves do not make it clear that those members will be teachers. Is that the Government's intention? If so, should not they make it clear in the regulations, rather than referring to people from those representative organisations as "members"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for explaining why the regulations prescribe a membership of 63, not 64. As I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
shall be involved in considering the Bill setting up the disability rights commission, and have an interest in disability issues, I note and welcome the Minister's acceptance of the commission's importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appointments made by the Secretary of State are another aspect about which we have slight concerns. I suspect, given his intervention, that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) will comment on that issue. First, who the Secretary of State will appoint is very open-ended, outside the references to representing the interests of parents of pupils. I note that the regulations do not say that such members shall be parents—they say only that they shall represent the interests of parents of pupils. Would it not be more appropriate to make it clear that some parents will be appointed to those bodies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned special educational needs. The interests of the general public should also be reflected. Perhaps the Minister would explain what sort of person the Government envisage that it would be appropriate to appoint as a representative of the interests of the general public, given the different interests that are already represented in the categories set out in regulation 8. That includes the Confederation of British Industry, as well as Church bodies and various commissions on equal opportunities. Clarification on that point would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the members elected from the teaching profession—should the Government's proposals on performance-related pay and the restructuring of the teaching profession go ahead—I have assumed that members of the new leadership group to be appointed are counted within the teachers' category. In that way, it will be possible for the teachers elected to be heads of department and deputy heads as well as classroom teachers. Responsibilities differ, and it would help if we knew how the Government envisaged that issue panning out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the eligibility of teachers standing for elections, will the Minister explain the position of someone at an independent rather than a state school? That position may be covered by the Education Reform Act 1988, and I apologise if that is the case, but reference is made to teachers rather than teachers in the grant-maintained sector. What is the Government's intention regarding that issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 5(1)(b) provides that someone can be elected as a teacher only if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he is employed or engaged to provide his services as a teacher"—</p></blockquote>
which presumably means that he does not actually have to have been teaching—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for an aggregate period of two years or more in the five years preceding his election or appointment to the Council."</p></blockquote>
So presumably, someone might teach for two years, then spend three years not teaching, and still be eligible for election as a teacher representative on the general teaching council. If this is to be a professional body for the teaching profession, run by the teaching profession, there is an issue about whether people
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
should be in post as teachers. Surely it would be better to ensure that someone standing for election has current experience than to allow someone who has had some experience, gained at some time over the past few years, to qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are detailed comments. I note that the Minister has been making notes, and I trust that he can answer most of my detailed points about the constitution of the general teaching council. Aside from that, as I said in my opening remarks, we continue to be concerned about the nature and operation of the general teaching council. Because so many members will be appointed by the Secretary of State in addition to those representing interests in the field of education, 29 members will be appointed by bodies in the education field or by the Secretary of State. There will be 25 elected teacher-members, and nine members or teachers appointed by the teacher trade unions. That is an interesting balance because—depending partly on the answer to my questions on teacher trade unions' representation—people who are not teaching or in the teaching profession might be in the majority. Given that the regulations provide for a general teaching council for the profession, that would be a mistake. The council should be run by and for teachers, for teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made an interesting differentiation between teaching and teachers, which echoed a theme that is emerging from many of the statements that the Government are making. They are tending to dismiss the views of teachers on many issues—performance-related pay, for example. The general teaching council should be a body for the teaching profession that is made up of teachers. The body's balance of power should rest with the teaching profession rather than with others whom the Secretary of State has seen fit to appoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the constitution as it is set out in the regulations, I fear that the Government are continuing the mistake that they have made in the way that they are establishing the GTC. They have ensured that it will not be a powerful body for the teaching profession, which regulates who can enter the profession and the standards within it. The Government missed an opportunity in the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, and they are continuing to do so in the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Throughout the entire 34 years, particularly the last 18, there was not a single suggestion that the Tory party might establish a general teaching council. In fact, it fought the idea tooth and nail, because the last thing that it wanted was for the teaching profession to have any say over what it did or its standards and opportunities. It was happy for other professions to have their own organisations, such as the General Medical Council, but not the teachers. That is not a matter for today, but it should be pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cunningham—that is quite right. We are simply following on from yesterday's Question Time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrat Members welcome the establishment of the GTC, which is one of the Government's early achievements and was a pledge that was made before the election. We have genuine criticisms, which we made throughout the passage of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill. Although we were delighted by the changes in emphasis and balance that were made to the Bill, we believe, like the hon. member for Maidenhead, that some opportunities have been missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A factor that may be ignored during today's debates is that the setting up of the GTC is, by and large, a very open process. Of the 13 members to be appointed by the Secretary of State, we now have an idea where three are to come from, although we do not in the case of the remaining 10. There is also the problem of the other members to be appointed under paragraph 11(1) of schedule 1 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. That allows the Secretary of State to appoint two members who can sit on any committee of the GTC and can have a representative on such bodies as the Secretary of State may designate. I shall come to that later, and I warn the Minister that I shall ask him for some explanation of how those posts will be decided and what opportunities will be afforded to me people who are placed in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Association of Chief Education Officers, the National Childrens Bureau, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Campaign for Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities Commission and, of course, the disability rights commission will have representatives on the council. That shows that the Government have listened to some of the concerns that have been expressed and have acted on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious—the hon. Member for Maidenhead touched on this in her last remarks, which were the most important that she made—that this should be a teaching GTC, not a teachers' GTC. If it is to enjoy real commitment from the whole teaching profession, however, teachers must take ownership of it. Even after changes to the regulations, only 39 per cent, of the GTC—25 of the 64 members—will be elected teachers and not representatives of other organisations. That is an important point. We ask the Minister, particularly in relation to the Secretary of State's appointments, to place some emphasis on letting teachers take control of their GTC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we take into account the teachers' organisations, which account for a slim majority of 34 out of 64 members, the GTC still does not meet the claims in the Department for Education and Employment document "GTC: A guide to teachers" that the GTC will be an "independent, professional body" and that it will
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide a voice for the teaching profession".</p></blockquote>
I genuinely do not think that that will happen. If, as the Minister and I would like, the GTC is to be an enormous success and mark a new beginning for the teaching profession, we need to tackle that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not arguing against increased representation from appropriate groups; indeed, we think that that is absolutely right. We are, however, arguing against the need for the Secretary of State to have 13 of his appointees on the GTC, which is unacceptable. If, as has happened under the Secretary of State, representation by representative groups has increased, he should need to make fewer appointments rather than maintain the same number. If the Secretary of State has the right amount of representation—clearly he has not, and there are good reasons for that—he should need to make fewer appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation paper said that key groups should be represented, and there has been plenty of time to consider all of them. Which key groups have not been recognised or notified as to why the Secretary of State still needs his 13 representatives? Perhaps die Minister will tell us where the 10 representatives will come from and whom they will represent. It would be encouraging if he could say who they will be; if not, he will have failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maidenhead made a comment about regulation 9. The Minister was honest in responding to my question about interested parents and special needs, and I welcome that. His answer was appropriate, and we look forward to an opportunity in the near future to clearly identify interested parents and those with special needs as special interest groups
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
so that the Secretary of State will automatically appoint people from those groups. His answer was helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bemused by the words "the general public". Surely, all the people who do not represent teacher-specific interests are representative of the general public. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what ideas there are for appointing a member of the general public. If he says Richard Branson, God help us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to respond to several groups and to say why they have not been included as specific interest groups. Will he carefully consider including the 10 additional members to be appointed by the Secretary of State as specific representatives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dearing report made clear the need for an institute of learning and teaching in higher education. All hon. Members welcomed that recommendation. The ILT, as it will be called, will soon be set up. Why will not an ILT member be appointed to the GTC? Surely the ILT is an important interest group that should be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Standing Committee for the Education and Training of Teachers should surely be represented on the GTC. A representative of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers will be among its members, but that is the employers' group and does not represent teachers themselves. Teacher trainers will play an increasingly important role within the ambit of the GTC, in the future of the teaching profession and in the raising of standards. To deny GTC membership to a teacher representative of teacher trainers is, in my humble view, a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GTC will include representatives of Catholic schools and Church of England schools. However, we live in a multiracial society. If we have learned anything at all from the past couple of years and from the Lawrence inquiry, we should know that the multiracial character of our society should be represented on all bodies. The School Standards and Framework Bill will allow Muslim schools to emerge, and I foresee that they will do so in areas such as Bradford and the west midlands. Surely other faiths need to be represented on the GTC. I do not believe that that can adequately be achieved by including only representatives of the Church of England and the Catholic Church.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During consideration of the Bill that became the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) and I argued strongly that further education and its teachers again seemed to be left out. I find it amazing that although there is a place on the GTC for the Association of Colleges for Further and Higher Education, which is the employers' organisation, there is not a place for teachers employed in further education. How can that be justified? The Minister may say that the further education national training organisation will soon be established, but it will deal with occupational standards and will not be a professional body
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
representing further education lecturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members must recognise that many people working in school sixth forms have followed that route with the professional qualification of the postgraduate certificate for further education. Such people have a legitimate right to work in a sixth form, especially on vocational work. They also have a right to work in the further education or higher education sectors with that qualification. The GTC will not, however, include any representative of teachers in further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must give the matter greater emphasis, if we are to start dealing with the issue of lifelong learning and to begin to put further education in its rightful place at the heart of the lifelong learning agenda, where it should be a genuine bridgehead between schools, universities and lifelong learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister accept that organisations representing the teachers about whom I have spoken should be among those appointed by the Secretary of State? If he does so, the Liberal Democrats will be very happy. If he is saying that the Secretary of State wants the 10 places and the other three about which he has spoken for other reasons, we shall not be happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 11(1) of schedule 1 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"two representatives of the Secretary of State and…one representative of such body as the Secretary of State may designate…shall be entitled to attend and take part in deliberations (but not in decisions) at meetings of the Council or of any committee of the Council."</p></blockquote>
Why on earth do we need them in addition to the other representatives? What will they do? What is so special about the privilege of these people to come along and take part in discussions without voting rights? Is that not another example of the Secretary of State not trusting the people who will be on the general teaching council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Secretary of State's desire to have such control over the GTC gives lie to its description as an independent body? If it really will be a body for and of the profession, such as the hon. Gentleman and I were talking about, it should be divorced from the influence of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that intervention. She made precisely the point that I have tried to make about the organisations that will not be represented. She also made the strong point that teachers must have control of the organisation if they are to have real faith in it and commitment to it. Like other members of the Committee, I visit schools and I do not feel that the GTC even figures in teachers' thinking. That is sad, given the number of years that it has taken to get to this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GTC is crucial to raising standards in the teaching profession, and to giving it the increase in morale and professional esteem that for so long it has wanted and aspired to. The profession must be trusted.

The regulations give the impression that the Secretary of State is paying a little lip-service to the teaching profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that there is to be a general teaching council for Wales. It is another nail in the coffin of the peculiar entity that has historically been described as "England and Wales". That organisational structure is out of date and will not last much longer. I am glad to see that it has not been applied in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that we are discussing the regulations to establish a general teaching council for Wales within weeks of the National Assembly for Wales coming into existence, and within a couple of months of the Assembly taking responsibility for such regulations. However, I understand that there has been a need to move ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representation of teachers on the general teaching council for Wales seems to be stronger than that proposed for the council for England. My concern is that, nevertheless the unions will be seriously marginalised by the structure of the council. Only four of the people nominated by the Secretary of State will come from the teaching unions. Twelve teachers will be directly elected, and that will strengthen the teachers' position. However, the campaign for the election of those teachers may be an inter-union campaign. It might be as well to acknowledge that, and to strengthen union representation on the council. It is more likely that a coherent voice of the teaching profession will be heard if the unions' position is strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations set out the current position. The Assembly will have the opportunity to revamp them, and to restructure the general teaching council for Wales. It will want to do that along with the other work that it will have to do to create a sensible structure in wales. We have a pretty chaotic structure in Wales, inherited from legislation drawn up with Wales as an afterthought to England. The Assembly will want to consider the council's relationship with other national educational bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council can play an important function, in addition to the core functions described by the Minister. It should take responsibility in Wales for the promotion of the teaching profession and for encouraging people to enter the profession. The council will be the best body for that job. Currently, there is an anomalous situation in Wales. The teacher Training Agency has an outpost in Wales which tries but fails to do its job well. The people at the TTA in the Welsh Office are very good, but it must be borne in mind that the TTA has no statutory status in Wales. When it was established, it was decided to have no agency specifically for Wales, and for the broader body to have no powers there. The impression given at the time was that that function belonged to the Higher
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Education Funding Council for Wales. Subsequently, however, the TTA established an office in Cardiff, which sticks its oar in here and there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, at a time when there is a serious recruitment problem in Wales, as elsewhere, there is no coherent approach to encouraging people to enter the profession. I envisage that this new body will play a vigorous role in that regard. I also envisage that it will have a serious imput into initial training by working with higher education institutions to agree on, for example, the kind of curriculum that needs to be pursued in those institutions. I can envisage its making recommendations and taking advice on the funding available for initial teacher training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru has adopted the sensible proposal that certain schools might be designated as training centres. They would be funded for that purpose and would come to arrangements with particular higher education institutions to deliver teacher training in partnership. I would foresee the Welsh GTC being involved in such initiatives. I also see it being involved in revising the conditions of access to initial teacher training courses. Some of the conditions that have been imposed by the Welsh Office on qualification for entry into the profession have been unrealistic and kept out of the profession people who could make a useful contribution. There is much dissatisfaction in Wales with the fact that the Welsh Office failed to take account of representations that were made during the consultation process on the curriculum and on conditions of access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I envisage the GTC having an important imput into the structure for in-service training or INSET Chaotic may be too strong a word to describe the current structure in Wales, but it certainly lacks coherence. There are grants for education support and training from the Welsh Office, and both the Welsh Office and local authorities are involved in the administration of those grants and in relation to service-level agreements with schools for in-service training. The schools themselves, of course, use their own budgets as they choose to assist teachers in professional and personal development. In addition, the higher education institutions offer their services to schools and teachers. What we do not have is a coherent structure for providing professional development for teachers, which is very important. I envisage that the GTC will try to pull that together and formulate a strategy to ensure that the various players work coherently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plaid Cymru proposes another all-Wales body—the education and training council for Wales—which would take responsibility for curriculum development, assessment, examination, an advice service to teachers and in-service training. Those could be provided in an integrated way. That body—which does not exist and may never exist, although we should like to see it—would work together with the GTC. We would then have a sensible institutional structure in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the points that I wanted to make.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Generally speaking, I welcome the regulations and I welcome the fact that teachers are strongly represented on the Welsh body in one way or another. I have expressed my reservations, but I am glad that the regulations have been laid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I express my appreciation for the way in which all members of the Committee have contributed and their constructive approach? I shall respond later to the initial and final points made by the hon. Member for Maidenhead, and to the bulk of the points made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, but first I shall respond to the comments of the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Dafis).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion made profound points about the additional functions that he believes that the general teaching council for Wales should take on. Those points are perfectly reasonable, and will be addressed by the National Assembly for Wales. We should simply take note of them and understand that the hon. Gentleman has expressed the aspirations not only of his party but of others. As he said, the organisation of England and of Wales is different. I was slightly disappointed that the hon. Gentleman did not give the Government credit for introducing the legislation that has given rise to the National Assembly for Wales, but pigs may fly one day, even in the south Wales valleys. However, it is perfectly legitimate to debate how the council should develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second substantial claim was that we were marginalising trade unions. That is not true in Wales or in England. My view is that the multiplicity of teaching trade unions creates a serious problem for the profession and education as a whole. We have seen evidence of that this Easter. As I have told union representatives on various occasions, they should urgently seek to address that issue, because the divisions that emerge are often on relatively minor points, compared with the great issues facing the profession as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the establishment of the general teaching councils and the fact that there will be direct election to them will set in motion a process that will in time make it easier for that problem, which is common to many of us concerned with education, to be addressed, so that we can achieve a much more coherent voice for all teachers. That is why we took the decision that we did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the specific points made by the hon. Member for Maidenhead, of which I took a note as they were made. First, on the issue of special schools, special needs and so on, as she said, we have provided in regulation 4(e) for specific representation for a teacher from a special school. However, as the hon. Lady will know, a large number of children with special needs are being educated in schools that are not special schools, and it is important that the general teaching council reflects that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
As I said in response to an intervention by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough during my introductory remarks, a clearly defined framework does not yet exist through which such representation can be properly expressed, although we want to develop and encourage such expression in a series of professional ways. That is precisely why we have specified in the regulations that the Secretary of State must represent such needs. That is also why, following consultation, we specifically took account of the need for the new disability rights commission to nominate directly to the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to concede to the hon. Member for Maidenhead that, in time, we may decide that there is a better way to deal with those issues than that set out in the regulations. However, the three channels set out there—first, election directly from special schools; secondly, the obligation on the Secretary of State to nominate people with experience of teaching children with special educational needs; and, thirdly, the specific representation of the disability rights commission, once it is established—give full representation to those working that area, and will, I hope, mean that the general teaching council will reflect those needs. As I said, as the council evolves, we may find a better way to achieve that, but the provision is reasonable at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point made by the hon. Member for Maidenhead about the difference between England and Wales in the number of head teachers compared with the number of teachers is fair and interesting. However, the regulations provide simply for "teachers". Head teachers may well stand in other categories. Indeed, they may be nominated not only by teacher trade unions but by a number of head teacher organisations that are entitled to nominate. Also, as the hon. Lady will know from her intimate relations with the National Union of Teachers and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, those organisations will also be considering the possibility of nominating head teachers in those categories. Therefore I do not think that the hon. Lady's point has great substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the bodies that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough did not mention was the national college of headship training, which is not yet established. That is a legitimate area that could be reflected in the nominations. We will want—and this reflects a specific point made by the hon. Lady—the whole of the leadership team and the head teaching profession to be represented on the general teaching council, and I am sure that they will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Lady's third point about middle schools, nurseries and nursery schools, I can confirm that her interpretation of the regulations is correct. Both categories come under the junior category set out in me regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Lady's fourth point about the period over which elections will be held, dealt with in regulations 6(4) and 6(5), the conduct of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
hustings—and all the other issues that entertain and preoccupy us politicians—will have to be left to the general teaching councils over time, to see how things work. Various organisations conduct elections very differently. Some do so by postal ballot; some circulate manifestos to everybody; some have organised hustings in different areas. The regulations will not restrict any of those ways of operating. People have different views about how the electoral process should be conducted and what kind of profile the election should have. However, I want to emphasise, in response to the specific point raised by the hon. Member for Maidenhead, that we are not saying, "This will or will not happen in a particular way." We need an evolutionary approach to the conduct of elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's point that it is for the GTC, once it is up and running, to determine how future elections will take place, although certain parameters are laid down in the regulations for that "electoral scheme", as it is described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read the regulations, the first set of elections will be conducted under rules set out by the Secretary of State. The process of electing teachers for the GTC's important initial four-year period, when it will get established and make its name, will be determined by the Secretary of State. What thought have the Government given to that issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been thinking about that question, which presents a number of key organisational problems. For example, establishing the addresses of all qualified teachers is a non-trivial task as things have been operating so far. We are thinking about it very carefully. The conduct of the elections is very important. There are other issues, similar to the ones raised by the hon. Member for Maidenhead. I am sure that proposals will be made by various organisations, as we get nearer to September 2000, about how and where the debate should take place. Will it be in journals such as the 
	<i>Times Educational Supplement,</i> in hustings in particular places or via manifestos? We have been considering the issue, but I would be misleading the hon. Lady if I gave the impression that we had come to a view and we are not telling anyone about it. We have not—we welcome views about the way in which the elections should be conducted. But there are some formidable organisational issues involved in getting these first elections right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Lady's fifth point, I draw her attention to regulation 5, which makes it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person shall be eligible for election under regulation 4 or for appointment under regulation 7"—</p></blockquote>
the regulation dealing with teachers—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or to fill a vacancy"</p></blockquote>
under either of those categories unless they fulfil the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
criteria for being a teacher. So the teachers' union representatives specified in regulation 7 are required to be teachers, whereas the elected people are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be pedantic on this detailed point. I referred earlier to regulation 5(1)(b), and the point about the aggregate of two years in a five-year period. I referred to someone who had been appointed to a position in a teachers' trade union, had been a teacher for two years out of the five but was one no longer. I have just realised that the Minister is about to tell me that the word "and" links regulation 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b), and I will sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to say that, because I cannot rival the hon. Lady when it comes to pedantry. I was going to deal with the point that she made about regulation 5(1)(b) later. At this stage, I simply want to respond to her earlier point and to say that representatives of the teacher trade unions mentioned in regulation 7 face precisely the same requirements as teachers mentioned in regulation 4 who stand for election. That is made clear in regulation 5; the measures are precisely the same. We can argue—we may do so in a second—about the merits of those constraints, but they are identical for both categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may, I shall deal with the hon. Lady's points about regulation 9 and the Secretary of State's nominees in a moment, when I deal with the general issues that have been raised about the Secretary of State's power in that regard. On the issue of the leadership group and teachers, I acknowledge the hon. Lady's point. As I said earlier, we are seeking teachers' involvement, subject to provisos and definitions in the regulations to the effect that they need to be qualified. We make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On independent schools, we make it clear that independent school teachers can stand for election or be appointed if they are registered qualified teachers and meet the eligibility requirements in regulation 5. I cannot, however, hide from the hon. Lady the fact that some independent schools are worried bout the eligibility for election of teachers who have been on their books for a considerable period and whom they consider effectively to be qualified teachers, but who do not have formal qualified teacher status, as required in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations do not exclude independent schools, but there is an issue for such schools, which I have just set out. My hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards is discussing it, and we are working together to see whether we can make changes to deal with some of the relevant points. They are, however, difficult to deal with. Whatever one says about the merits of someone who has been teaching for 20 years but who does not have qualified teacher status, it is difficult to say in the regulations mat we accept that such a person has the right to be involved. That is why we have held to the definitions in the regulations, even though there are serious issues for independent schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
We are trying to find a way to deal with that. I acknowledge that the independent schools who raise the issue do so with integrity; they are not seeking to argue a particular corner for themselves, but to ensure that their teachers can play a full part in the process. We are considering the matter in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the hon. Lady's point about regulation 5(1)(b) and about the two years in the past five. We have been through much discussion and there has been much consultation about the point. It is difficult to decide what the point of definition is. Should we say, "You have to be a serving teacher?" Would that disqualify someone who had been on maternity leave and who had been out of the profession for a while? To take the more controversial point, what about someone who had been seconded and had been a trade union representative for a period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a range of reasons why people are out of teaching for a short period, as the hon. Lady knows. In particular, those include family responsibilities, but there are other issues. We took the view that we should be a bit flexible, which is why we have chosen the definition of two years in five. One can argue the toss and ask whether it should have been three of four years, but we took the view that our definition was a fair and reasonable way of going about matters, which is why we came to the settlement in the regulations. I know that the hon. Lady was not making the point strongly, but simply trying to develop discussion of it. I hope that she accepts that opting for two out of five years is a reasonable way of approaching the matter, provided people fulfil the other criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with the hon. Lady's point about having a majority of teachers by reference to regulation 7, so I shall not mention it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough raised a point about the Secretary of State's role in relation to specific groups. First, I do not think that Richard Branson is putting himself forward in that category. I stand second to nobody in my admiration for Mr. Branson and his wonderful achievements—[
	<i>Laughter.</i>]—at least publicly. As far as I know, he is not trying to run the teaching profession at this stage. Virgin teachers are supposed to be incompetent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was involved in student politics, I visited colleges of education. It was the time when they were more often isolated, rural, all-women sites, dotted around the country. When I, as a male student union official, came to visit the women presidents of the student unions in those colleges, they were required to put their beds in the corridor, as they were whenever they were visited by a male. That raised many interesting questions. I am not sure whether Richard Branson has anything specific to offer and advise in such matters. I gather that things have changed, and that there is a different state of affairs these days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the specifics of the people to be nominated and then the general role of the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
State. It is a perfectly legitimate and fair point that when the institute of learning and teaching in further education is established it may well have a claim. I assure the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that that will be actively considered by the Secretary of State when considering his or her nominations. Regarding the Standing Committee on the Education and Training of Teachers, we believed that that was covered by the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers, which is nominated. That was another reason why we felt that the Secretary of State should have flexibility and be able to address the matter directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought at great length about the problem that the hon. Gentleman raised about the multicultural nature of representation, and looked at a variety of ways of establishing a representative structure that would work. In terms of voluntary schools, Church of England and Catholic schools are by are the far most dominant in number. There are Muslim schools appearing, and there are some Jewish and Methodist schools. However, the overwhelming majority of schools—I do not have the statistics to hand, but probably 96 or 97 per cent, or more—are Catholic or Church of England. That is why we specifically referred to them. We decided that the regulations should give the CRE representation to try to take account of that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, when considering his or her nominations, will specifically consider how to ensure that voluntary schools from different faiths are represented in the process. It is a difficult issue, because there is no co-ordinating structure across the different Churches that could say, "We are going to have two nominees on the general teaching council, and there must be a council of the faiths underneath that." That would become very bureaucratic, and would be inappropriate. Similar issues arise in a number of other areas relating to nomination to bodies, not least to the other place. We made the judgment, which I accept was not perfect, that Church of England and Catholic schools should have direct representation because of their numerical dominance in our system. I assure the Committee that the Secretary of State will actively look to schools from other cultures and faiths in the nominations that he makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further education was a more difficult issue, and we discussed at great length how best to address it. It becomes an elastic piece of string. All I can say to the hon. member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is that we believe that we have taken the best approach to the issue, taking into account the flexibility of the Secretary of State. I am aware that what I have said will not make Liberal Democrat Members happy, in the phrase of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, and one of my main ambitions is to make the Liberal Democrats happy at all times. However, I hope that I have satisfactorily explained by we took our decisions.

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I turn to the role of the Secretary of State. The hon. Members for Maidenhead and for Harrogate and Knaresborough both ignored the fact that there is an important requirement for the Secretary of State to be directly involved in the regulation of the teaching profession and the issues that surround that. Those are issues of major public interest, as is the case with doctors and other professions. It is right in principle that the Secretary of State should be directly engaged in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of the numbers game, the regulations require that 34 of the 64—a clear majority—will be active, practising teachers as defined by regulation 5. Those are minimum requirements, and I am confident that the actual number of teachers on the general teaching council will be significantly greater than that. Many of the nominees from the other bodies, and those of the Secretary of State, will be practising teachers. In a way, the same applies to parents. The overwhelming majority of members of the general teaching council will be parents. The reason for our use of the formulation in regulation 9, which deals with the Secretary of State's obligations, is that there must be some people on the GTC who are thinking about their role as parents. That is why we used the phraseology that we did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I defend in principle the role of the Secretary of State—it is right that he or she should be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I conclude that the Minister believes that Secretaries of State should have such a role in the General Medical Council, the Royal College of Surgeons and other professional bodies such as the Law Society? Secretaries of State do not have such involvement in those bodies, so why is it necessary in the general teaching council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing an important point, although I do not mean that at all rudely. All such existing bodies have evolved over the years, and have developed their own constitutional forms, approaches, styles, powers and responsibilities. They have done so for years, decades and, in some cases, centuries. The precise form of the organisations' relationship to the state is very particular to each profession. The Royal Society and the royal colleges are especially good examples. I looked into the matter in my past life. The charters enabling bodies to call themselves royal are controlled by the Privy Council and by a whole series of issues affecting their relationship with the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I enjoyed the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the imposition of the Conservative Government, but it was not just they who created the present situation. For decades, the teaching profession did not evolve, as other professions did, a structure to give it more power and authority. We are starting the new body's evolution from scratch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The hon Member for Maidenhead spoke about the powers of the general teaching council. As she acknowledged, however, the regulations deal not with powers but with composition. The powers and the way in which the general teaching council operates will be determined by the way in which it evolves and the standing that it has in the community, among teachers and so on. The bodies representing doctors, lawyers and so on have evolved in precisely that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the value in principle of the Secretary of State's role, which is important because of the time at which the organisation will develop, it will also offer flexibility in the evolution of the general teaching council. That flexibility will be felt not just in nominations, but in various other issues as the body evolves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State and the Government are committed to helping the development of the general teaching council, which is why we are laying the legislation. We are not doing so for any other reason—the provisions are based on a conviction that has been held for some time. We believe that, as the body evolves and its powers are reconsidered, the Secretary of State's intervention will aid, not hinder, development. If that prediction turns out to be false and in 2010 the organisation is sclerotic rather than helpful, people will argue differently. I hope and believe, however, that the Secretary of State will in general play a constructive role in the body's evolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also explains the specific powers contained in paragraph 11 of schedule 1 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998, which was mentioned earlier. The Secretary of State may suggest representatives and invite a body to send to meetings a representative with a specialist interest or expertise. Such representatives will be able to join discussion, but will not take part in decision making. Such involvement is excluded from the process—decisions will lie with the GTC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I should like first to thank hon. Members for their remarks and thoughts. Secondly, I strongly defend the Government's commitment to establishing a general teaching council that is controlled and possessed by teachers, and which can evolve as the professional body has so desperately needed to do, and raise the status an self-esteem of the teaching profession. The Secretary of State seeks to help that process rather than to hinder it, which is why he has the role set out in the regulations.
