	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Authorities (Alteration of Requisite Calculations) (England) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 228).</p></blockquote>
I am pleased to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I look forward to serving on this Committee considering these regulations this afternoon and to our relatively speedy progress. At the same time, I hope that members of the Committee can consider the issues that the regulations raise because they raise serious questions about the way in which our local government finance system operates and the gap between the Government's stated intention in opposition and what they are now putting into place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although these regulations are entitled the Local Authorities (Alteration of Requisite Calculations) (England) Regulations, which sounds a straightforward, albeit technical measure, on closer examination it becomes clear that they constitute a major shift of the balance in our local government system which breaches some important principles. I want to take a little time to consider what these regulations mean in practice and to air some of the concerns that have been raised by local authorities, by community groups, by the Local Government Association and by others in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of those issues have already been debated in the Standing Committee that considered the Local Government Bill some weeks ago. My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) took an active part in those discussions, and I read the exchanges that took place with some interest, not least because the Minister, knowing that this debate was going to take place, was understandably not entirely forthcoming about all aspects of the issues concerned. Indeed, some notable speeches were made by Opposition members of the Committee which outlined only too clearly the damaging effects of breaching these important principles and what that would mean for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was at my council budget setting meeting on Monday night where we had a debate about our council tax level which, in my London borough of Sutton, will cross the threshold that these regulations set. Labour members of the council urged us to go just a little further on the grounds that, with the council tax benefit subsidy limitation that the regulations introduce, only an additional 19p would be added to a band D council tax in my constituency. They argued
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that the regulations and the issues relating to council tax benefit subsidy limitation should not give cause for concern because they were not having much effect. That did not seem a sound argument. It concerned me greatly that Labour councillors who had been briefed on the issue thought that it was enough just to look at the figures and how they were being applied in the current year and not be too concerned about the principles behind the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that as Sutton is in the relatively prosperous south-east, his council's increase in council tax above the threshold will have much less impact on his council tax payers than the same increase will have in poorer areas of the country? The Government will say that they have included some safeguards, but they are not enough to stop poorer areas losing out more than wealthier areas of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is one of the points that had passed my Labour colleagues on the council by. The dampening mechanism set out in the regulations will work in such a way that the poorest of our communities will pay the most. That seems perverse, and is a reason why, although we are moving the regulations, we wish to move them into a siding rather than onto the main track; we do not wish to see them implemented by this or any other Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain a little more about the regulations. There are two types of authority that are affected by them: the billing authorities, which collect our council taxes and send out the bills, and the precepting authorities—the county councils. County councils are subject to the legislation now making its way through Parliament and will therefore also be captured by these regulations. The council tax collecting authorities will, unless that legislation goes through, find themselves in an invidious position, in that their collection funds will be penalised by the way in which this system will work. Attempts were made in the Committee considering the Local Government Bill to question the Minister as to whether, if the relevant clause of that Bill did not get through the Committee— and it still has to get through on Report—the Government would pull these regulations. I hope that the Minister will return to that point later. If Parliament decides that the measures set out in the primary legislation currently under consideration are unacceptable—a view shared by a growing number of Members in all parts of the House—and that the principles raised by them are ones to which Labour Members would not subscribe, I hope that the Government will then withdraw the regulations. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how the Government might approach that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Council tax benefit is intended to assist those who cannot afford to pay the whole of their council tax bill. Under the existing arrangements, the Government provide 95 per cent, of council tax benefit through the subsidy scheme. Local authorities currently provide 5 per cent., but the regulations will give the Government powers, for this year and subsequent years, to claw
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
back council tax benefit subsidy paid to local authorities that set a council tax increase that is deemed excessive. The regulations set out the criteria by which that will be judged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme will apply to both the billing and the precepting authorities, and each tier will be responsible for meetings its share of the clawback arising from the regulations. The Standing Committee considering the Local Government Bill paid attention to those matters, and to the changes to the law necessary to provide for the precepting authorities to be caught by the clawback regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations contain a complex algebraic formula, a seminar on which the committee might find entertaining. During the Committee on the Local Government Bill, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) gave details on the way in which the formula operates. Since then, he and others outside that Committee have rightly pointed out that the Secretary of State's estimate of the council tax yield for each local authority—or the average that is assumed, which is 16 per cent.—is crucial to how the measure bites. As my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton has already said, it bites disproportionately on the poorest local authorities and on the poorest communities in those local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, the threshold to which the rules will apply is last year's council tax plus 4.5 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before our little trip downstairs, I was explaining that the regulations operate through a complicated algebraic formula. Unfortunately, the blackboard that we requested in order to go through the formula has not arrived. Therefore, we cannot dwell on all the details, although I am sure that other hon. Members want to enmesh themselves in the formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide that, this year, the threshold to which the rules apply will be calculated by adding 4.5 per cent, to last year's council tax. When the threshold is passed, a system of tapers determines the clawback that specific councils have to pay. For example, if a council spends only 1 per cent, above the 4.5 per cent, increase, an extra quarter of the increase will have to be paid out of local resources. That will mean reductions in services and a shuffling of financial resources. The sum will ultimately be paid by council tax payers. One way or another, it will affect communities. If, however, the rise is a little more—if it is 3.5 per cent, above the 4.5 per cent, threshold—all the increase will fall on the council tax locally. None of it will be met from the council tax benefit subsidy from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred just now to the algebra underlying the regulations and set out in the schedule. The crucial term of the formulae is B, which pops up in one or two places. Hon. Members who have not yet had a chance
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to study all the regulations may want to know that B is the proportion of council tax yield from benefits estimated by the Secretary of State, or 16 per cent. That 16 per cent. comes into play only if the real figure or the Secretary of State's estimate turns out to be higher. That is an important aspect of the working of the formula, because of the way it affects authorities in relation to their level of gearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The range of gearing for local authorities is quite diverse. The average is around one to four, so that to increase spending by £1 it would be necessary to put up council tax by £4. For some local authorities it can be significantly higher and for others significantly lower. The key determinant of the gearing effect is the extent to which the local authority's expenditure is supported by national non-domestic rates and revenue support grant. The authorities that tend to be most supported by those means are the poorest, which do not have a sufficiently large or well distributed revenue base to support services locally. All too often those are also the local authorities with the most band A and band D properties and the ones that suffer the greatest impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite simply, some of the poorest communities will pay more as a consequence of the regulations that we are considering, and will be disproportionately affected in comparison to some of the wealthier local authorities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton pointed out, my local authority is not significantly affected, because it is relatively wealthy, with a relatively low gearing ratio. Those with high gearing ratios—often the poorest authorities and communities—will suffer most.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another factor, which perhaps the hon. Gentleman is not taking into account—the variation of rate support grant in relation to the variation of standard spending assessment. He may have noticed that the different definitions of SSA for this and the following financial year are such that, essentially, SSA means what Ministers want it to mean. That is a very unpleasant imponderable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read the exchanges between the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford) and the Minister in the Standing Committee, which went to that very point. He is right that this is a case of words meaning what Ministers want them to mean to suit particular convenience and arguments. I should be interested to know what definition will be thought applicable to today's debate, as compared to the debate in Standing Committee a few weeks ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of disparities will arise, which will get worse in time. Because of the way the formula works, there will be a link between the settlement established this year and future settlements, with respect to the working of the threshold. That is an attempt to prevent people from manipulating the system to their advantage, but undoubtedly it will in turn disadvantage many of the poorest local authorities and result, in time, in a shifting of the burden of council tax benefit from the Exchequer to local people through council tax bills. That localisation by stealth of council tax benefit is an unacceptable breach of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
principle that national Government should support such welfare expenditure. The Government are shifting that burden by the back door, just as they are shifting the burden generally with respect to council tax policies, back to local council tax payers, but in a way that blurs accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is using some very nice words to describe what I consider to be crude universal capping. That is all it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates my peroration, perhaps; I may return to that. I have no doubt that the evidence introduced by the regulations is crude universal capping. It is dressed up with technical phrases, but quite simply that is what it is. It will have the greatest impact in areas with the most low-value properties—bands A and B—which often have the greatest number of benefit recipients. The effect will be greater in areas such as inner London and Merseyside, where needs are often greatest, and council tax payers in the poorest areas will be hit 10 times as hard as those in the least poor areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on the local government settlement on 4 February, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) raised a point of concern, fairly, about the way in which the regulations might affect some of the poorest communities. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a council in the poorer group of local authorities tried to increase its council tax over its budget requirement to sustain services, the application of the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme would be devasting, because of the clawback of the rate support grant.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The council tax benefit is payable to help people who cannot afford to pay their council tax. It is a social benefit and, I believe, it should be the responsibility of Government to meet the cost. Such direct welfare costs should not be a charge on the resources of local authorities. I emphasise that I am speaking of the poorer council group in local government."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 February 1999; Vol. 324, c. 1152.]</p></blockquote>
That is what we are talking about as we attempt to reject the regulations which will have a direct impact on the poorest in our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party, when in opposition, rightly aligned itself with those who opposed the breaching of this very principle in respect of housing benefit and opposed the previous Government's introduction of a regime that effectively put in place a mechanism for clawing back housing benefit subsidy from local authorities. In an exchange on 25 February in the Standing Committee of the Local Government Bill between the Minister for Local Government and Housing and my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton, the hon. Lady's response was simply that it was all right to oppose the clawback of housing benefit. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only other council tenants have to accept the burden of additional housing benefit."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee B, 25 February 1999, c. 549.]</p></blockquote>
But surely only other council tax payers have to share the burden of picking up council tax. I fail to see the distinction; if there is one, it is incredibly fine. The reality is that poor council tax payers will, as a consequence of the targeting of this measure on areas
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
with the highest number of bands A and B properties, be footing a disproportionate part of the bill to pay for the very poorest in their communities. We believe that the regulations are inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point of great concern to the LGA is the pace at which the change has been introduced. The association is anxious because it has not had an opportunity for adequate discussions with the Government. It has made clear its opposition to the regulations, but has also made it clear that it still seeks to continue discussions with the Government if the regulations go through today, because it wishes to know whether Ministers will be prepared to undertake a fundamental review of the way in which the new regime will operate during its first year and what its impact will be in practice rather than what Ministers say it will be. I hope that the Minister will give the LGA some comfort by undertaking to conduct a review with the association, thus building on the partnership about which the Government so often speak when they discuss their work with local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our view that the combination of the gearing effect, the tapers set out in the regulations, and the arbitrary nature of the way that council tax yields are being measured will affect the poorest communities disproportionately. Not only that, it will reduce accountability still further. Liberal Democrats have consistently opposed the application of crude and universal capping as well as this more sophisticated and sneaky capping now being introduced. The reality is that this even cruder device, which harks back to measures introduced by the previous Labour Government in their system of controlling local government expenditure, will further blur accountability and make it harder for local citizens to know who is responsible for their council tax increase. Is it the Minister, with her decisions on thresholds, or is it their local council? Whatever the answer, the consequence is that the poorest will pay. I hope that the Committee rejects the regulations because they should not be allowed to go through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, it is a pleasure to be under your firm chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by saying that the measure does not have a friend in the world, apart from the Minister. On this occasion, not even the Liberal Democrats are prepared to support the Government. The proposal was roundly condemned in the Local Government Bill Standing Committee; not one organisation supports the measure, and 129 councils and groups of councils have expressed their opposition to it. I shall be delighted to give way to the Minister if she thinks I have made a mistake and she can name one organisation or local authority that has spoken in favour of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that many of the councils that oppose the measure are controlled by Labour or by their Liberal Democrat bedfellows; nor is that surprising, because many of them will be the greatest losers under the measure. As my right hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Member for Skipton and Ripon said so succinctly in the Standing Committee, it means that highly geared local authorities are most affected.

The same point was also made powerfully by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley, whose constituency is in a reasonably well-off area, no doubt full of prosperous dentists and other professionals. Under the regulations it would be affected 10 times less than Liverpool, Hackney or Newham. Indeed, my hon. Friend calculated that 19 of the 22 poorest councils in the country would be hit hardest by the scheme. Perhaps when the Minister responds to the debate she will confirm that; if it does not count as universal capping, I do not know what does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality as the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) said, is that the main burden will fall on people in properties in bands A and B. What price social exclusion now? As we heard, one of the organisations queueing up to rubbish the regulation is the Local Government Association, which mentioned precepting, billing authorities and the fact that clause 24 of the Local Government Bill is an essential part of the new regulations. The LGA said that council taxes or precepts that are above a guideline or threshold are regarded as excessive. The guideline is the higher of 1998–99 council tax plus 4.5 per cent., known as the council tax route, or such higher increase in council tax necessary to allow the authority to spend the cash increase in its standard spending assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above the threshold, councils lose benefit subsidy as seen from the formulae in the regulations. For example, for an authority with a threshold of 4.5 per cent., a rise of 5.2 per cent, will lead to 0.25 per cent, of the additional cost being borne by local council tax payers. A rise of 8.1 per cent, will lead to all the additional costs being borne by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LGA makes no bones about saying that it is opposed to the scheme in principle and in practice. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The scheme will impact unfairly on different parts of the country … the worst hit being those with the highest proportion of low value property and the highest percentage of benefit recipients … "—</p></blockquote>
that is a kind of double whammy—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will be felt hardly at all in prosperous areas of the South East. It will have much more of an impact in inner London and on Merseyside."</p></blockquote>
As we heard, taxpayers in the poorest areas will be hit 10 times as hard as those in the least poor areas. I shall read out a list of the top 10 authorities affected, not least because at least one or two Labour Members represent parts of those areas, which are: Liverpool, Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Manchester, Newham, Islington, Lambeth, Waltham Forest, Knowsley and Southwark. If that were not bad enough, the LGA states that the disparities will get worse in future years—unless the Government have second thoughts. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's policy is that subsidy will be limited in the years after 1999–2000 by reference to cumulative increases since 1998–99 … However, the implication of this is that the disparities between authorities for 1999–2000 will become worse in future years."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
In short, as the LGA puts it, rather graphically,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the scheme could become the thin end of a very unpleasant wedge."</p></blockquote>
Another significant point made by the LGA is that only the English seem to be entitled to the full benefit of the scheme. The English scheme is significantly harsher than the Scottish or Welsh schemes. I would be grateful if the Minister would deal with that in her reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been difficult to select a handful of the scathing comments about the regulations by the local government press. A good article by Mr. Philip Walker in the 
	<i>Local Government Chronicle</i> makes the point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The impact on poorer authorities is more questionable because no authority can win from the scheme. An authority which curtails its tax increase to below 4.5 per cent, does not receive bonus payments."</p></blockquote>
From the Government's perspective, it is a win-win situation. The article endorses some of the points that I have already made—that it will impact hardest on some of the poorest areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Special Interest Group on Municipal Authorities states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"illustrative figures published by the government"—</p></blockquote>
these are the Government's own figures given in an parliamentary answer—
	<br><blockquote><p>"show that inner city councils like Birmingham and Liverpool come off worse"</p></blockquote>
under the scheme. An article published in February in the 
	<i>Local Government Chronicle</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the starkest examples of how the scheme has a different impact across the country, despite built-in safeguards, is that of Liverpool City Council and Wokingham DC".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Based on each council exceeding the guideline amount for subsidy limitation by 1 per cent, of their standard spending assessments, Liverpool would lose £926,000 but Wokingham would lose just £29,000."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am too tempted by what the hon. Member for Riverside said.

That does not mean that it will apply next year or in subsequent years. Given the fluctuations in SSAs, I wonder whether the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a fair point, which reflects his considerable experience in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another feature of the proposals, based on clause 24 of the Local Government Bill, is that they will not apply to parish councils. However, parish precepts are not within the control of borough or district councils. Will the Minister explain that lacuna in the provisions and how it could be said to be fair?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have the flavour of a George Orwell book. The Government inveighed mightily against the iniquities of capping and, while in opposition, they pledged to abolish crude and universal capping; but let us consider a more recent quote. A wonderful passage in the White Paper entitled "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People" reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A council which levies high council taxes should not be able to rely in this way on the national taxpayer to pick up the bill in its entirety for the escalating council tax benefit cost resulting from its own decisions. Moreover, the more fully the national taxpayer meets such costs, the more obscured is the link between local spending and local taxation."</p></blockquote>
It is difficult to think of a more eloquent argument for the original rationale for capping. No wonder the new procedures are sometimes referred to in the jargon as refined capping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From one point of view, the measure is worse than universal capping could ever have been. Under the regulations, a council that increases its council tax above the threshold will have part of its council tax benefit subsidy withdrawn, even if its budget is lower than its standard spending assessment. That is a perverse result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It all depends on whether one is buying or selling—in government or in opposition. Is not it especially ironic that we are debating the measure at a time when the leader of my party has signalled that a future Conservative Government would move away from capping? It is even more ironic that we are having this debate the day after another Budget from a pickpocket Chancellor who specialises in stealth tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Another aspect of this grubby little measure must be exposed. The regulations came into force on 6 February, the day after they were laid before Parliament. They rely for their legal validity on clause 24 of the Local Government Bill. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon pointed out in Committee, without such validity, the Government would not have a mechanism to distribute resources between precepting and billing authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed a little confused about that matter in Committee, so I hope that she will take the opportunity to make matters absolutely clear today. Clause 24 of the Local Government Bill was debated in Committee on 25 February, and has yet to clear all its parliamentary stages. Is it not totally presumptuous of the Government to promulgate the regulations and to assume that, with their massive majority, they can steamroller through a Bill with retrospective provisions? I cannot think of a better example—and examples are legion—of the Government's total contempt for Parliament. I suspect that, with the exception of Members of the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrat party, hon. Members representing the constituencies that I have already mentioned may have something to say on the subject. The Government cannot take their votes for granted. However, if I am wrong, those Members of Parliament will be judged by their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is at least one brave voice on such matters— that of the hon. Member for Normanton. He bears repetition for saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a council in the poorer group of local authorities tried to increase its council tax over its budget requirements to sustain services, the application of the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme would be devastating because of the clawback of the rate support grant."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 February 1999; Vol. 324, c. 1152.]</p></blockquote>
That is a telling indictment of the measure. I hope that the hon. Member for Normanton and others of like mind follow the logic of their position when such matters are debated and voted on in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the Government not listen to the unanimous voice of local government, along with the growing clamour from their own Benches, and abandon this extraordinarily inept and damaging measure? At the very least, will the Minister give a clear undertaking to review it as from next year, as the LGA quite reasonably requested. If the Minister does not do that, I shall ask my hon. Friends to divide the committee, regardless of the Liberal Democrats' intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather uncomfortable to have Conservative Members as bedfellows on local government matters. Capping began under the Conservatives, and they also invented housing benefit subsidies, so the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Conservative party gave the new Labour Government the idea of introducing council tax benefit subsidy. However, we, too, would like to press the matter to a vote, and we will not turn away from support from any quarter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn to the most crucial and fundamental argument against the scheme. The word "scheme" implies a plan, but I do not think that the regulations contain a plan. We are considering a nasty little measure that was probably dreamt up by civil servants who convinced Ministers that it was a good idea and another good way of clobbering councils as some of the brakes are coming off them. Our fundamental objection to the scheme, although there are other reasons for opposing it, is that meeting the costs of welfare and poverty is the Government's responsibility, and that they should not pass it on to local council tax payers. The scheme breaks the contract between central Government, citizens and local government. It is the Government's job, not that of local councils, to deal with poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations do nothing to increase local accountability. I was present during consideration of the Local Government Bill. During the passage of that Bill, the Minister repeated time and again that the Government were determined to increase local accountability and to rebuild the relationship between citizens and local authorities. The regulations will not increase local accountability, but further cloud the link between payment of council taxes and services. Local people will not know who is responsible when their council tax bills rise because subsidies are being removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly comment on town and parish council precepts, which were mentioned by the hon. Member speaking for the Conservatives. The issue also arose at some length in the Standing Committee considering the Local Government Bill. As I understand the regulations, the level of the town and parish councils' precepts on district councils, which are the billing authorities, will influence whether a billing authority exceeds the threshold to trigger the scheme. The regulations will not, however, enable a billing authority to reclaim the money from town and parish councils, although it could reclaim such money if a county council precept had caused it to exceed the threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled amendments intended to deal with that problem in the Standing Committee considering the Local Government Bill, and suggested two alternatives. The legislation could have enabled billing authorities to bill parish and town councils as they can bill county councils. Alternatively, I suggested that the scheme should not count their spending. The Minister rejected both suggestions, and I was not convinced by either of her arguments, one of which was that there is no central list of all the town and parish councils in the county. It is extraordinary that the Minister argued that. If there is no central list, it will be a pretty quick job to go round all the billing authorities in the country and to ask them for the names of parish councils with
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
relevant precepts. They sure as hell know which parish and town councils there are, even if the Government do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time, but I have a final point. As we have heard before, the nasty measure before us has no friends inside local government or elsewhere. Time and again we have heard the Government's excuses for so-called sophisticated capping, made on the ground that it was in their manifesto. It was not—their manifesto did not include council tax benefit subsidy limitation, and they have no remit or Back-Bench support for its introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very interesting that the Government have had to put the most senior Whip that they could find on to the Committee to ensure that Labour Members vote in the right way. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I know that he is a very nice man, but he is also the most senior Government Whip, and I am sure that it would be very difficult for some hon. Members to defy him, although I manage it regularly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Labour Members in the Committee have experience of local government. I pick out the hon. Member for Riverside, who has a long track record in local government. If a Tory Government were seeking to introduce the regulations, I cannot believe that the hon. Lady or other Labour Members with experience of local government would support them.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because I want to hear the Minister scrabble around to try to explain what is no less than crude and universal capping. The Labour party stated in its manifesto that, in government, it would remove capping, but the Minister is now sneaking it in through the back door in the form of regulations in the hope that it will slip through. I thank the Liberal Democrats for just beating us to it. If they had been half a step slower, they would have been behind us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are based on the position of local authorities in 1998–99. I was interested to hear the splutterations from hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Riverside, who said that Liverpool would be all right. It will be all right this year because of the manipulations of the SSA, which happen to have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
helped it. However, they have not helped many other local authorities. Some inner London boroughs, especially those whose expenditure is, because of the circumstances of that particular time, below SSA, are trapped. Some, such as Brent, Ealing, Lewisham and Newham, are exceptionally poor areas, yet the Minister says to the Committee, "Oh, they'll be all right." It is another example of the "have faith in me" approach that we experienced all through the Committee that considered the Local Government Bill. However, we do not have faith in the Minister. She is able to manipulate the SSA, and she did not give the Committee a decent answer about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard spending assessment was defined until this year as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"representing an appropriate level of budget requirement to provide a standard level of service".</p></blockquote>
Need comes into the calculation all the way through. The new definition states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The calculation makes use of information reflecting demographic, physical and social characteristics of each area."</p></blockquote>
Need slips off the scale when the Minister wants it to. The calculation can be entirely subjective if the Minister wants it to be. If she decided that the political complexion of Liverpool was not suitable because the Liberal Democrats had slipped off the side of the bed in the House of Commons, Liverpool could find itself in a rather different position, still based on the 1998–99 situation. There is no opportunity for the recognition of changes in any form, because the position is set in time at that particular point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first time that local authorities have been hit at a level below the standard spending assessment. The SSA has always been taken to be the minimum level. Labour members will hold their hands up and cry, "Aye", to the regulations, when in other circumstances, with a different Government, they would have run for cover and screamed against it. It will be fascinating to see them do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure will hit the nearly poor in difficult areas throughout the country where there are local authorities that can be badly damaged because of a change in their circumstances or their SSA. In some areas, especially poor areas, an enormous gearing effect can result from tiny shifts, particularly tiny shifts in the SSA. Various small shifts can have enormous multiplication effects on the council tax. Authorities will be struck by universal capping—something that the Labour party has campaigned against time and again. The way in which the measure is being sneaked in through the back door, hitting the poorest people, goes beyond anything that the Labour party has ever campaigned against. I hope that the Government will have second thoughts now or on Report of the Local Government Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel drawn to make a contribution, partly because I sat on the Committee that considered the Local Government Bill. When we debated the relevant clause, some of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Bill's typical features manifested themselves. It takes power away from local government and gives more power to central Government. That point must be highlighted as we debate the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two factors suggest that the regulations have not been introduced in an open and transparent manner. First, we would have expected the Local Government Bill to have passed through the parliamentary process properly before such an order would be produced. Secondly, the regulations' title is somewhat inscrutable to the ordinary human being: the Local Authorities (Alteration of Requisite Calculations) (England) Regulations 1999. For those on Government watch for this sort of measure slipping through, these regulations might not be so easy to spot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to place two points of principle on the record. The proposal undoubtedly undermines the Government's pledge to remove crude and universal capping, which is now occurring via the back door. That makes it more difficult for the general public to understand how councils are funded. They have enough difficulty anyway. For example, when the Chancellor announces in the Budget that a certain amount of money is available for certain public services, people think that they will really get that amount. They have enough difficulty understanding how the benefit subsidy works, and many people do not realise the way in which cross-subsidising takes place through that scheme. The proposals are therefore at odds with the Government's claim that they are open and accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second fundamental principle at stake here is that the Government have a responsibility to meet the costs of national welfare benefit. The extra spending, if not added to the overall welfare bill, disguises the responsibility for welfare spending. The Government were elected on a pledge to reduce welfare spending, and it is easy to see how they might claim, by this mechanism, that they are cutting the welfare budget at national level, while displacing the burden of that cut on to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question but that the taxable resources of poorer authorities are more sensitive to a loss of grant or to an increase in local council tax benefit costs. It is the poorer authorities that would be adversely affected by this change in the law. The scheme would reduce accountability by eroding the local tax base. I shall quote the hon. Member for Normanton on the subject, as it will underline that principle. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The council tax benefit is payable to help people who cannot afford to pay their council tax. It is a social benefit and, I believe, it should be the responsibility of the Government to meet the cost. Such direct welfare costs should not be a charge on the resources of local authorities."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 4 February 1999; Vol. 324, c. 1152.]</p></blockquote>
That principle is being undermined by this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember why the Government are introducing the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme. When a local authority takes the decision to increase council tax, the cost of council tax benefit also increases. At present, on average, nearly a fifth of council tax revenue comes from council tax benefit—a significant proportion. Those council tax benefit costs are paid by the Exchequer and there is not, therefore, a pot of gold in the middle of the room for us to go to. The Exchequer means the national taxpayer. That means that the national taxpayer is paying for the council tax benefit costs arising from local decisions. That does not fit in with our aim of increasing local financial accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must also recognise that the national taxpayer pays the revenue support grant.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument is that the new device before us will strengthen accountability.

The Government, in partnership with local government, are putting in place an ambitious programme for modernising local government. One key part of that programme is best value. The Local Government Bill, which is currently before Parliament, lays out the key aspects of the best value framework and of the scrutiny procedures that underpin it.

We are also working towards introducing other aspects of the reform agenda for local government, such as new political management structures, improving local democracy, and a new ethical framework.

The hon. Member for Eastbourne was a Member of the Standing Committee, but the hon. Member for Mole Valley was not present, nor was the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, who prayed against the regulations. As I explained in that Committee, it is important to see the whole local government agenda as having connections. The issue of accountability fits in with the whole raft of local government reforms, which will bring about fundamental change in local government by improving and modernising it.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves too far from the point on which I wanted to intervene, will she deal with one concern?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not think that that is hair splitting. The hon. Gentleman either has very thick hair or he is using a bad analogy. If he allows me to develop my argument, he will see more clearly what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the modernisation agenda is about improving local financial accountability. We have therefore ended crude and universal capping. There has been no pre-announcement of capping limits for 1999–2000. The Government want local authorities to take full responsibility for their decisions on spending and taxation, and local people to have more influence over those decisions. We hope that the changes that I have just mentioned—best value, improving local democracy, changing political management structures—will help to achieve just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we also need to be able to protect local taxpayers from irresponsible increases where necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will let me finish my argument first, I shall certainly give way.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
We are therefore taking new reserve powers—which, as the hon. Member for Taunton acknowledged, were in our manifesto and are in the Bill—to replace existing capping powers. We hope and expect that all local authorities will be responsible and prudent, providing their taxpayers with good services at a price that they are prepared to pay. However, we cannot be complacent. We need to be able to take action where necessary, and the new reserve powers will enable us to do so flexibly, taking into account future changes in circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also provided greater stability in funding. The hon. Member for Mole Valley said that my hon. Friend the Member for Riverside did not know what would happen next year. Liverpool council knows what will be its SSA for next year, because it has been told that there will be three years of stability. I understand that Liverpool council has already announced that it will not be raising the council tax this year, next year or the year after. They will therefore not be subject to council tax benefit subsidy limitation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is setting out the Government's vision for local government, and claims that that will transform the way in which local government relates to its citizens and make it far more modest in future in the amount of money that it will seek from council tax payers. Does the Minister have some idea of when the reforms will lead to that nirvana? If she has a date in mind, why do not the regulations include that date? This crude measure could then be brought to an end if the Government delivered what they promised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We dealt with this in the Committee considering the Local Government Bill; amendments—sunset clauses—were moved to that effect. However, I made it clear that I do not envisage a particular date by which the changes will have impacted on every authority. Each authority must take responsible decisions about the review of services, for example, and about when it will introduce other changes. We must pass other legislation in the House before local authorities are able to take advantage of some of the changes. It is neither responsible nor possible to set an end date. We cannot set a date by which everything will have changed when the change in the relationship between central and local government is not mechanical but cultural. That must be worked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said several times in Standing Committee, I hope that it will not be necessary to use the new powers at all. However, the new capping powers will be in place in case they are needed. They should not be needed, and I hope that councils will respond to their local council tax payers, rather than to a figure set by central Government—to which they used to spend, because they thought that if they did not spend that amount one year, they would be penalised the next.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the regulations are also about cultural change. Given that their effect is directed more to authorities run by the Labour party, it is the culture of Labour-run local authorities that she hopes to change most by the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister responds to that intervention, I note that the debate is getting rather wide, whereas the regulations in front of us are fairly narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly try to talk about the order in its more narrow sense, but I would say to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, "Watch this space". I am not sure that the regulations will have a bigger impact on Labour authorities. Interestingly, the authorities that have been bandied around by Opposition Members will not suffer this year; Newham's council tax increase has been set at 2.8 per cent., so it will not incur the council tax benefit subsidy limitations that we are debating, and nor will Hackney or Liverpool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the inner London boroughs have set their council tax increases at below 4.5 per cent., with the exception of the borough that the hon. Member for Mole Valley used to represent. They have not all spent up to the 4.5 per cent, guideline, as they might well have done previously, because we have changed the year-to-year operation of the system. In fact, the regulations will impact this year only if councils take particular decisions. They know what impact their decisions will have and they must take responsibility for them in the light of the regulations. We wrote to councils on 5 February and they had the consultation document some months before that, so they have had the information for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about stability in the SSA and then mentioned the inner London boroughs. In some ways, they have done really quite well this year, because they received a special grant. However, if the hon. Lady is correct, that means that either they will be clobbered next year because they will lose that grant, in which case there is a reasonable chance that their council tax will go up sharply and they will be hit the following year, or they will get the special grant next year. Perhaps the Minister would give us some indication of the Government's thinking on that. Another option is that the SSA will not be stable, but will increase in the following year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister intend to review the regulations and change the base on which they have been drawn up—that is, the 1998–99 round—in subsequent years? If so, the whole thing will be up for a replay this time next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to table new regulations next year linked to the guideline that the Government set next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Based on what SSA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Based on the broad principles that we have already laid out. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not expect anything different, and nor, if we are considering stability, would local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have provided greater stability in council funding by announcing the aggregate grant provisions for councils for the next three years and stabilising the formula for distributing grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third part of the package of measures aimed at improving local financial accountability is the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme, which protects the national taxpayer from costs arising from local decisions. We believe that councils making large increases in council tax should not be able to rely on the national taxpayer to pick up the bill for all the resulting additional council tax benefit. We want to make councils take responsibility for their council tax decisions. We have therefore set a guideline; council tax increases within that will be eligible for council tax benefit subsidy, but any increase above it will be partly ineligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 1999–2000 the guideline is a council tax increase of 4.5 per cent, or such larger increases in council tax as is necessary to allow the authority to increase its budget requirement by the cash increase in its standard spending assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not suspect that local authorities considering their budget for next year will feel rather nervous when the likes of Brent, Bromley, Ealing and Kensington and Chelsea have expenditure below SSA? Whatever their circumstances, if they want to protect the nearly poor in their area, they will do their best to ensure that they do not spend below SSA, in case a crunch comes down upon them in a subsequent year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is how local councils take decisions—I hope it is not. I thought that they carefully considered their needs and resources, and sought to deploy their resources in the most efficient and effective way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must give way on that point, surely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to ensure that I stick within your ruling, Mr. Atkinson, and make progress. I have made clear the basis on which I expect councils to take their decisions, and I know that the majority of them are doing so in precisely that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that the guideline has been set at a reasonable level, in the light of the settlement. There is a taper, so a council's contribution to the additional benefit costs will rise the higher above the guideline that it spends. Councils setting council taxes up to the guideline level will continue to receive subsidy, as now. That is why it is not true to say that none of the cost will be met by the Government. Up to the guideline, as in the past, 95 per cent, of the cost will be met by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if a council increases its council tax by more than the guideline, some or all of the costs will be borne locally. Local council tax payers will, therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
collectively meet more of the cost of council tax benefit resulting from excessive council budgeting decisions. We recognise that the amount of council tax revenue met by benefit is higher in some local authority areas than in others. We are protecting poorer areas by ensuring that they are treated as if they had the average proportion of council tax revenue met by benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should also remember that the benefit entitlement of individuals is not affected by the scheme. Council tax payers on benefit will not be penalised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They just get fewer services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that they will get fewer services. The introduction of best value will change the way in which councils deliver services. We know that councils will be able to achieve 2 per cent, efficiency savings in a year. I do not agree that that automatically means a reduction in the quality of services being delivered. Indeed, I expect the quality of services to improve, not to lessen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Taunton raised the issue of parish councils. As I explained in the Standing Committee considering the Local Government Bill, I have considered that issue extremely carefully. At the end of the day—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Treasury won?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Treasury win? It certainly looks as if it did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman thinks that this Government works in the same way as his Government did—fighting among themselves all the time. That is not the case. I am happy to take responsibility for the regulations; I am responsible for the Government's decisions, and do not need to hide behind the Treasury, as the hon. Gentleman sought to do on numerous occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Taunton raised the issue of parish councils. I hope that she will recognise that I have considered the matter in some depth. The administration of the hon. Lady's suggestion would be much more bureaucratic and difficult. I therefore decided that the cost of the suggestion would outweigh any other benefits, and concluded that neither of the proposed alternatives was advisable. Both proposals would bring much more difficulty and complexity to parish and town councils, many of which would find them far too difficult and expensive to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, I mentioned the comments of the LGA, which wants the Government to undertake a fundamental review of how the scheme works in its first year. The Minister just referred to a matter that needs such close examination after the first year. It will be necessary to find out whether the complexities and difficulties that the scheme will introduce into the links between town and parish councils will have the effects that we predict. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that councils will let us know about such matters. I look forward to hearing from the hon. Gentleman if he receives any evidence of problems, especially those affecting parish and town councils. I have made it clear that future regulations will have to be put before the House, so we have to keep an eye on what is going on. We will accept representations and views from local government about the administration of the scheme during its first year. If it can come up with any better ways of supporting the principle, we will want to hear and act on its suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the representations that the Minister has not answered stated that the expenditure of a number of local authorities has been set below the SSA under the regulations. Will she explain that shift of the SSA minimum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman goes on about that, and has done so on numerous occasions. I have tried many times to give him the answer. He continues to argue for Wandsworth rather than for his new constituency. The Wandsworth question, as it has become, assumes that the regulations are a capping measure. They are not a capping measure, but relate to the increase in council tax benefit and to its effect on the national taxpayer. The central issue is not SSAs or whether the regulations are a form of capping, but increases in council tax and the consequent increase in council tax benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mole Valley knows that I have sought to be honest with people about SSAs, which have always been the means by which a grant that is agreed by central Government at national level is distributed. I have ensured that the explanatory notes about this year's settlement spell that out. I believe that that approach is more honest than the previous one, which is why we changed the explanation about SSAs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be succinct, as we are short on time. The Minister made a point about Wandsworth. I deliberately did not speak about Wandsworth, because it has the second lowest council tax rate in the country, so the effect that she describes is minimal there and is probably the second lowest that it could possibly be in Britain. The hon. Lady ought therefore to concentrate on the other inner London authorities and on their circumstances next year, when they will have lost the special grant, unless she intends to bring it back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Once again, the Minister and the hon. Gentleman have had an interesting exchange. It was not, however, strictly relevant to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me to look into a crystal ball. I do not have a crystal ball, and do not believe in them, so I shall not speculate about next year. The regulations relate to the position this year, which is exceptionally clear. As I said, the majority of inner London boroughs have set council tax increases for next year below 4.5 per cent. Therefore, this measure will not impact on them at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that she is willing to consider further representations from the Local Government Association. The Local Government Association is asking her to go one step further in developing the partnership that she mentioned at the beginning of her remarks, and to work in conjunction with the LGA in reviewing the impact of the scheme after the first 12 months. Would the Minister be prepared to accept such an initiative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that the hon. Gentleman does not understand the nature of the relationship that we already have with the LGA. We meet the LGA very regularly, and there is a group that deals with finance. The LGA has always refused to get involved in distribution issues because it cannot agree between the different classes of authority. That has been a problem. I am encouraging the LGA to get more involved in financial issues and I am sure that, over the coming year, we will address the issue in the partnership meetings and in some of the sub-groups. The LGA will make representations to us in the normal course of the development of the partnership. I have always said that I am prepared to listen to the LGA. We are currently agreeing the terms on which we are going to deal with SSAs and other issues that affect the grant and its distribution. That work is already in progress—I believe that I have an official level meeting with the LGA very soon. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am trying to explain to the hon. Gentleman what happens. He is asking for something that I do not recognise as being relevant. We will continue to work in the way that we do within the partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not going to set up a special group to review this matter. Our procedures allow the LGA to make representations on whatever it likes during the meetings, and I am sure that this matter will be discussed. However, we will not undertake a fundamental review of a principle that we have only just introduced and that needs to bed in. We will naturally look at ways in which the system could be administered more effectively, and we are happy to work with the LGA on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. However, we really must pin her down on this. I hope that representatives of the LGA will read the record of the Committee's proceedings. However, there is no point in that if the Minister has a wholly closed mind. All that the LGA is asking is for the Government to look at the matter afresh. It does not want to know at this point what the result will be, although it knows what it wants it to be. I fear that the Minister's response to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is basically a no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really am staggered by the hon. Gentleman. He clearly does not have a clue about how the Conservative Government worked—or did not work—with local Government, or how this Government do. The Conservative Government had a statutory meeting on finance with local government that both sides said was a total waste of time. It was, to put it mildly, a fruitless exercise. We have a relationship whereby we meet very regularly. Nine
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
members of the Cabinet were at the last meeting. There will be another meeting of the full partnership in two weeks. We do not restrict or control the agenda. The Local Government Association can put on the agenda what it feels is appropriate. Nor is it only Ministers from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions who hear its pleas; Ministers from the Treasury are involved, too. Any implications by Tory Members that the Government do not take seriously consultation and discussion on the range of matters affecting local government is simply proof that they have not moved on in their approach to local government since they lost the election so comprehensively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is about time that I sat down. At the beginning of the debate I reminded hon. Members of the principles of the scheme. They are simple: to improve local financial accountability and protect the national taxpayer from the costs of locally made decisions. I believe that hon. Members support that principle. I think that I have said enough, but I hope that hon. Members will support the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate about an important set of principles. The principle that the state, through central Government, should be responsible for dealing with poverty and welfare payments was breached by the previous Government, who legislated for the powers that the current
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Government are now using to breach it still further; they are instituting a measure that will mean the nearly poor paying for the poorest in our communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, we now know that the Minister is not willing to engage with the Local Government Association. Representations, dialogues, partnerships and panels are no substitute for working in conjunction with the LGA to review the scheme, but the Minister has rejected that. I hope that the Committee has listened to what has been said by hon. Members on both sides and will reject regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
