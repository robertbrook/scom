	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are about to debate Clause 19. The Chair is in some difficulty. Again, it is a question of blacks, whites and greys. I could rule very narrowly that we keep the discussion to the two prime words "certificated" and "registered", but I have the feeling that something more than that might be desired. I ask hon. Members not to go into a wide-ranging debate on the whole merits of the General Council and all that relates to it, and to try and state their cases succinctly, because it has been hinted to me that we might even finish the Bill this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that ruling, Mr. Jennings, and I will endeavour to keep strictly within it. It was not and is not my intention to go into the merits of the General Council. I agree that this is not the time to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be within the recollection of the Committee that two Clauses of the Bill have at different times been described as the most important or even as the most controversial. Those are Clauses 1 and 11. In my view, Clause 19, while it may not be the most important, is certainly the most controversial. It has two purposes. First, subsection (1) restricts the rights of teachers to the enjoyment of certain procedures and securities in the matter of dismissal to registered teachers and withdraws those rights from certificated teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, subsection (2) has the effect of preparing the way for the extension of compulsory registration to university
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
teachers and teachers in further education. The hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary shakes his head at this point, but I hope he will be able to elaborate on it, because we have had little or no information about the implication of subsection (2). However, I now wish to concentrate in the first place on subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should understand what are the rights which it is proposed to withdraw from the certificated teacher and to confer upon the registered teacher. The relevant provision of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, the parent Act, lays down, firstly,
	<br><blockquote><p>"No resolution of an education authority for the dismissal from their service of a certificated teacher other than a teacher who has completed forty-five years of first class service … within the meaning of the Teachers (Superannuation) Regulations shall be valid unless—

	<ol>

	<li>written notice of the motion for his dismissal shall, not less than three weeks before the meeting at which the resolution is adopted, have been sent to the teacher and to each member of the education authority; and</li>

	<li>not less than one-half of the members of the education authority are present at the meeting; and</li>

	<li>the resolution is agreed to by two-thirds of the members so present."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Section 85(3) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"If at any time within six weeks after the adoption of a resolution … a petition is presented to the Secretary of State by the said teacher, praying for an inquiry into the reasons for his dismissal, the Secretary of State shall make such inquiry as he sees fit …"</p></blockquote>
These are the rights which it is proposed to withdraw from certificated teachers and to extend to registered teachers in their place. We should be clear that these rights are written into the contract of every teacher who was in employment with an education authority in Scotland prior to 1st April last. The proposal to withdraw them raises fundamental issues. The Government are, however, going very much further. They are at present engaged in evicting and, indeed, hounding out of employment a handful of teachers who have still declined to register with the General Teaching Council, and are doing so in a manner intended to cause the breaking and disruption of existing contracts of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
There is a revealing contrast between all the wonderful things the Government say in documents like "In place of Strife" about contracts of employment and what they themselves are doing about teachers in Scotland who decline to register. Before we agree to the Clause we should consider how the Government propose to treat the teachers. In January, the Government decided to issue default orders against certain local authorities which had failed to agree to issue dismissal notices to teachers in their employ who had declined to register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 7th February, there was an interesting report in 
	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> explaining how the orders would work. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authorities have been given until March 28 to comply with the provisions of the School (Scotland) Code that govern the employment of teachers in the schools…. Orders were made yesterday by Mr. Ross declaring these authorities to be in default and requiring them to comply with their statutory duty. An official of the Scottish Education Department explained last night that the orders mean that by March 28 the authorities must no longer be employing unregistered teachers. It was not a matter of teachers being given notice of dismissal by that date. Asked how this would affect individual contracts that teachers may have with the authorities, such as one month's or two months' notice, he said:—'It is for the authorities to work out what steps to be taken'."</p></blockquote>
That statement has never been corrected, contradicted or altered by the Government. The implications are clear, that local authorities on which default orders have been served and which have binding contracts of employment with teachers in their employ, such contracts not expiring till after 28th March, are required by the Government to break them. This is unforgivable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been reluctant to admit what they have been doing and what they propose to do. Time and again I have asked the hon. Gentleman what local authorities were to be required to do about teachers whose existing contracts would guarantee them the right to continue to be paid after 28th March. In the County of Angus, only a tiny handful of teachers have not registered, but it seems certain that they will not receive notices of dismissal which could enable them to run out their contracts by 28th March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Bruce Millan)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's refer-to Angus. No default order has been served on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand what the official said. I will repeat 
	<i>The Glasgow Herald</i> report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood it perfectly well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has never been countermanded or corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has nothing to do with Angus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An official of the Scottish Education Department explained last night that the orders meant that by March 28 the authorities must no longer be employing unregistered teachers."</p></blockquote>
I agree that Angus has not had a default order served on it, but we have never been told whether the 28th March edict applies only to authorities on which default orders have been served or to all of them. But even if it does not apply to all of them, even if Angus does not find itself in this dilemma, the case is not altered. The fact is that, where such orders have been issued, local authorities are being required by the Government to break existing contracts of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to elicit from the Government some statement of what local authorities are supposed to do in this impossible situation, but the Government flatly refuse to answer. I finally asked the hon. Gentleman whether the Government would agree that, in the circumstances, Section 201 of the 1947 Act, which requires auditors of local authority accounts who find that a local authority has been paying salaries it is not entitled to pay to advise that the sum of these salaries should be recoverable from the elected and appointed officials of the council concerned, should be suspended in relation to this matter. All he replied was that this was a matter for the auditors in the first place. Of course it is, but the point is that, unless that Section is withdrawn, local authorities with default orders on them and which decline to break contracts of employment with teachers stand to be fined by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
Government. This is inexcusable and un-forgiveable. I hope the hon. Gentleman will withdraw from the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a great deal of bluff and blackmail about the Government's behaviour in this matter, and perhaps even at this hour we shall be assured that they have had second thoughts, recognising that they cannot expect local authorities to break existing contracts of employment. This is a grotesque procedure of blackmail and bluff and should not have been entered into in the first place. We should not agree to the Clause with this threat hanging over every teacher in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say that in passing the Clause we are merely following the advice of the Wheatley Committee. We heard this argument from the Secretary of State on Second Reading, and have heard it whenever the whole question has been discussed in the House. It is very interesting to see precisely what the Committee said. In paragraph 128 of its Report, it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our recommendations would lose much of their force if registered teachers did not have the same rights as certificated teachers and unregistered teachers did not have the same disabilities as uncertificated teachers."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 171 of the Report, it was stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think it desirable, therefore, to stress that all existing certificated teachers will have to register with the Council, from a date to be determined by it, if they wish to continue to be entitled to the advantages of certification."</p></blockquote>
Those are the two key sentences in the Report on which the Government have based their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee goes on to say in paragraph 128:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We cannot recommend in present circumstances that it should be an offence for an unregistered person to be employed in teaching; but we do recommend that it should be made an offence for an unregistered person to pretend to her or hold himself out falsely to be, a registered teacher."</p></blockquote>
That would be indisputable. In paragraph 171 the Committee stated, after the sentence to which I have referred, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"certain rights such as those of superannuation in relation to past service will, of course, be preserved but the teachers must become registered in order, for example, to continue within the superannuation scheme for the future."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
In other words, the warning to teachers in the Report was not that unless, being fully qualified and experienced teachers, they rushed along and registered they would lose their employment. It was that their pension rights might be affected, which is an entirely different proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, I have never believed that the House should consider itself completely bound by the recommendations of an outside committee or Royal Commission. Plenty of reports from Royal Commissions have remained dead letters because the Government refused to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Up to now the hon. Member has been perfectly in order, even within the narrow sense in which I felt inclined to limit the debate, that is, on the question of certification and registration, but when he starts arguing the merits or demerits of outside committee reports he is straying a bit. I think that he should leave the Wheatley Report now and return to the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not seek to argue the merits or demerits of the Report, but was saying that I would not accept the argument that we would be bound to approve the Clause because it might be claimed to fulfil the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee. That is not a sufficient justification. But that was the only point I was going to make in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will also say that the Clause follows ineluctably from the Schools (Scotland) Code (Amendment No. 1) Regulations which the House approved last autumn. But the House did so on the basis of a total misunderstanding, because it was totally misinformed by the Minister; we were assured that only a tiny minority of teachers had failed to register by that date. A few weeks later it transpired that that tiny number was 1,200 teachers. If the House had had that information the Regulations would certainly not have been approved without a Division. Therefore, I do not accept that our having passed the Regulations is sufficient justification for us now to go on and approve the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will say that the battle is over, that all save a tiny handful of teachers have been blackmailed and bullied into line. The latest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
figure of teachers who have so far not registered, given in a Parliamentary Answer yesterday, I think, was 353, which is not as small as all that. I understand that nearly half of them have applied for registration. I have never doubted that at the end of the day very few teachers would decide to go to the stake, to throw in their jobs because they declined to register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what will happen thereafter? This is another matter that we must consider very carefully before approving the Clause. I believe that there will be a small number who will make martyrs of themselves, but that when that happens hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of teachers in Scotland will decline to reregister when required to do so in April. Then what will happen if we approve the Clause? All those hundreds and perhaps thousands of teachers will be deprived of their rights under the dismissal procedures under the principal Act. The Minister can order local authorities up and down the country to fling them out of employment regardless of their contracts of employment at a week's notice or less. He may find this amusing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find this pathetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it contemptible that the Government should make local authorities proceed with breaches of contract in this way. But there will be nothing to prevent them from doing this if we allow the Clause to go through as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we must consider not merely the position of the 350 teachers who have continued to decline to register but possibly a far greater number who, provoked beyond endurance by seeing a number of their colleagues, whom they know to be well qualified, highlyexperiencedteachers, being thrown out of employment, decide not to re-register. Then the Minister can base himself on the Clause and order local authorities to sack them at a week's or day's notice, without any right of appeal, without any right to complete their contracts. This is a barbarous procedure. Unless the Minister can tell us that he has thought again and realised at this late hour the enormity and absurdity of this, I hope and trust that the Committee will reject the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
I am concerned about subsection (2) because the other day the Secretary of State told the hon. Member for Hamilton (Mrs. Ewing) in a Parliamentary Answer that no decision had been made about extending to teachers in further education the rules regarding compulsory registration. But, clearly, subsection (2) is the paving to such a procedure. The Minister shakes his head. I hope that he will be able to reassure us on this. Till I have heard his reply I shall be equally flatly opposed to any proposition that we should extend to another class of teachers this grotesque procedure of blackmailing and bullying teachers into registration. If that is indeed the purpose of the subsection I am just as resolutely opposed to it as I am to the first subsection. Judging by the gyrations of the Minister's head, it may be that this is not the proposition. I shall be delighted to hear it, and I hope that he will explain what the purpose is. But that is how the subsection reads. I should be highly disinclined to accept it till that point has been cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Committee can accept that we should pass into law a Clause which enables the Government to order local authorities in Scotland to break their contracts with their employees and to fling those employees out of employment over a contentious matter which has nothing to do with their ability or qualifications as teachers, virtually at the drop of a hat. For those reasons, unless the Minister can give us assurances which he has entirely failed to give us over the months until now, I trust that the Committee will reject the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised a number of very interesting points which I hope the Minister will answer. Before he does so, it might be convenient if I intervene to try to make some comment on the situation which will confront us if the Clause goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most grateful to you, Mr. Jennings, for allowing the debate to range as it has done. I shall not try to push the horizon of reasonableness any further away, but it may be relevant for me just to say that I am sure it is right to consider the Clause against the whole background of the events of the past year or two and the establishment of the General Teaching Council and the difficulties there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
have been over the registration problem during the past months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious that the Minister should realise that, in my view it was right to establish the Council. If it was right to do so, it must be equally right to do everything in our power to enable it to work properly and efficiently. This must involve the principle of registration, and it is a great pity that some aspects of the registration history of these last months have been handled clumsily. I will not say any more about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The announcement last week that the constitution and functions of the G.T.C. are to be reviewed will meet the doubts of some of those teachers, possibly a large number, who had not previously registered. I hope that we shall see the number of unregistered teachers fall sharply during the next days. I am very glad that the Secretary of State made the statement he did, which is precisely what I asked for just over two months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I believe that my hon. Friend has put his finger on a critical point. It follows that some teachers, unfortunately, may be subjected to dismissal before long because of their decision not to register even in the improved climate which has become clear in the last few weeks. Whether they are right or wrong in their decision not to register is irrelevant to the main question, which must be what their position in law as employees is to be and what their contractual right is to be. If the Minister can give us an assurance that the contractual obligation which exists between the employing authority and the employee will be honoured and that no action by the Government will reduce the contractual rights of those employees, I will be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has indicated that there could be circumstances in which a local authority, by honouring the terms of its contracts with its employees, could bring its own authority members into conflict with the law. I trust that that will not be the case, but I am certain that the Committee will be grateful to my hon. Friend for pursuing what appears to be a worrying and serious point, not only through the Questions which he has tabled over the last weeks but in his speech this morning. I trust that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
Minister will address himself to that point, and I hope that he can remove the doubts which are in our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) has made a number of speeches in recent months about the General Teaching Council. Having listened to them all I still have no idea whether he supports the General Teaching Council, whether he thinks that it was a reasonable and good idea to establish it, and whether he thinks that it ought to be supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to have the assurance of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) that he supports the General Teaching Council, that he thinks that it was right to establish it, and that he supports it up to the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Support for the Council inevitably means support for the principle of registration. The two go together. They cannot be separated, and it is impossible to have the General Teaching Council without the compulsory registration of teachers. That was made clear in the Report of the Wheatley Committee, extracts from which the hon. Member for South Angus read this morning. It was made clear during the debates on the 1965 Bill, and it has been made clear by my right hon. Friend, by me and by others on many occasions since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to start with that basic fact. If the hon. Gentleman does not accept that, he does not accept the idea of having a General Teaching Council. That being so, the necessity for registration being fundamental and intrinsic to the establishment of the General Teaching Council, we come to the justification for this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 85 of the 1962 Act gives certain protection to certificated teachers, but that was a provision which long predated the General Teaching Council and the various Regulations which have come into being since the establishment of the Council. What the 1965 Act did was not to transfer the protection of Section 85, which at present adheres to certificated teachers, to registered teachers. What it did was add "registered" teachers to the "certificated" teachers already protected in Section 85 of the 1962 Act. What we have is a situation where both certificated and registered teachers are protected by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
Section 85. The hon. Member for South Angus did not appreciate that when he made his opening remarks. But registered teachers are already protected by existing legislation, a provision of which was brought into operation recently, and we have to ask ourselves whether that protection should still adhere to certificated teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion, granted the principle of compulsory registration and everything else that has gone since 1965, it would be quite anomalous and unreasonable to continue the protection of Section 85 for certificated teachers who are not also registered teachers. What this Clause does, therefore, is remove the protection at present adhering to certificated teachers and leave it only to registered teachers. With the exception of the hon. Member for South Angus, I think that most hon. Members will agree that that is reasonable and the only logical thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2), which deals with further education, has the opposite effect from that which the hon. Gentleman proposes. If subsection (2) were not here, the protection of Section 85 of the 1962 Act would be removed from further education teachers who are not also registered. In other words, certificated teachers in further education would have their rights removed if it were not for subsection (2). The intention of subsection (2) is not to pave the way to registration for further education teachers but to protect them in a situation in which they are not at present required to be registered. If the recommendations about the registration of further education teachers which have been made to the Secretary of State by the General Teaching Council are not brought forward, the full protection of certification given in Section 85 of the 1962 Act will continue. If the Secretary of State accepts that further education teachers should also be registered as an obligation on them, apart from the Regulations providing for that, we shall have to take steps to discontinue subsection (2) of this Clause. In other words, there will be ample opportunity for hon. Members to discuss the rights or demerits of registration of further education teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there will be no misunderstanding about this. Regardless of whether it would be a good idea to regis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
ter further education teachers, subsection (2) is a protection for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that I did not explain my point properly. I accept that, if we approve the Clause without subsection (2), teachers in further education, who are not required to register, will lose the protection. If we reject the Clause, on the other hand, there will be no need for this subsection. Incidentally, I still insist that it is a paving Clause. The last few words of it say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… this subsection shall cease to have effect on such date as the Secretary of State may appoint".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need not argue about this. The hon. Gentleman accepts the interpretation and intention that I have just put on subsection (2). It is there as a protection for further education teachers. If we pass the Clause, they are not deprived of any rights which they have at present under Section 85 of the 1962 Act, and any action on that will only come after a deliberate decision about the registration of further education teachers, which it will be possible for hon. Members to debate if that proposition should come forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the question of the default orders and teachers who are certificated but not at present registered, the hon. Member for South Angus said that this may be relevant to the Clause in that it is a consideration that we all have in mind in discussing the Clause this morning. But it is not relevant in the more important sense that the default order procedure, and all that has happened up to the present, has happened under the existing law, with Section 85 of the 1962 Act being in operation at present. Therefore it is not possible for the hon. Gentleman at one point to protest about the default order procedure and simultaneously to argue that by passing this Clause we are supporting the default order procedure, or that it was only because we should be passing the Clause that the default order procedure could have operated. The default order procedure has operated under the present legislation. Therefore, if there are arguments about the default order procedure which one wants to bring forward, they cannot be relevant to the passing of this Clause, because it was all done before this Clause was proposed to be put into operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not seen the point, which is that, unless we pass the Clause, under the old procedure teachers are entitled to a period of notice of dismissal, and they will lose it. Because of that, the default order procedure can go through without a teacher having any right to complain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is the hon. Gentleman who misunderstands the point. He is confusing the Section 85 protection with contracts of employment. Contracts of employment vary from one authority to another, and they include such matters as the period of notice on the termination of employment. That is the very point which I want to come to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the default orders, the point put to me is this. The default orders date from a certain date, namely, 28th March. The hon. Gentleman is asking me whether, in meeting the obligations imposed upon them by the default orders, education authorities have to act in a way which would enable them to ignore periods of notice which may be laid down and agreed between them and individual teachers in the contracts of employment of those teachers. The answer is simple. They do not. Education authorities can give to teachers exactly the same notice which obtains in their contracts of employment, despite the default orders, as they may have given in circumstances without default orders. If a teacher is entitled to a month's notice or to two months' notice, the notice which the authority will give him when it takes its decision about dismissal will be the same as it would have been if the default orders had not been imposed on the local authority. The teacher will not lose any payment in lieu of notice which may have been available to him under his contract of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one reads the default orders strictly, there is a sense in which teachers should no longer be employed in schools beyond 28th March, but that would not affect the availability, under the contract of employment, of payment in lieu of notice if an authority decided that that was how it should meet the obligations of the default order. I hope that these circumstances will not arise, because the small number of teachers concerned have the opportu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
nity to register before 28th March, and in other cases the date is extended beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were authorities in that position and if they wanted to give a period of notice going beyond 28th March and continue the employment of these teachers in their schools beyond that date, then, having given them notice before 28th March, I do not think that the Secretary of State would be likely to intervene. The important factor is that the decisions about dismissal must be taken before 28th March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman explain why the report in

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is close to giving the assurance I wanted. He said that the Secretary of State would not be likely to intervene. Can he give a firmer assurance than that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can be firm to the extent of saying that if authorities take the appropriate decisions by 28th March we will take no further action; that is as long as the decisions are taken in a genuine way and notices of dismissal are based on the contract of employment and not on the basis of giving lengthy notices, which would be a different matter. In other words, I do not want to give a defaulting authority an opportunity to give, say, six months' notice, which would be an absurdity, and which would not meet the default order. To that extent I can give the hon. Gentleman the unqualified assurance he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason why the hon. Member for South Angus has not received this assurance before is that he has not tabled his Parliamentary Questions in a form which would give him the kind of answer he wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had he framed his Questions intelligently I could have given him this assurance much earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire referred to the review of the General Teaching Council which was announced by my right hon. Friend last week. I agree with what he said about this, and I hope that all hon. Members agree that the critics of the G.T.C. have had as their major demand the fact that there should be a review of the constitution and functions of the Council. The Secretary of State had said that when the main interests concerned had given an indication to him of their desire for such a review, he would respond to their proposals. Having received those proposals, and it having been said that a review should take place, the Secretary of State acted quickly and announced the review last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, there is absolutely no justification for any certificated teacher to continue to be unregistered. I do not believe there was any such justification before last week. Now, there is no shred of justification. I therefore hope that teachers who are not registered will now register, and that the necessity of dismissal being imposed will not arise. It would be regrettable if it did. It has never been the intention of the Government to force a situation in which it should arise. We have always hoped that, at the end of the day, this regrettable necessity would not arise; and now there is no reason why it should even be contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With these explanations, I hope that hon. Members will approve the Clause and enable us to get on with the Bill, remembering that the Clause is absolutely intrinsic to everything we have done since the passage of the 1965 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear at long last that the Minister has agreed that there shall not be an obligation on authorities to break their contracts of employment with teachers who fail to register by 28th March.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —that they did not elicit the answer just given by the Under-Secretary. The fact is that the Government were determined not to answer my Questions. They were determined to give the impression that local authorities would be required to break their contracts of employment on 28th March. This was one more strand in the long system of blackmail and bullying which has been applied to this group of teachers over the months. I utterly reject any suggestion that what has happened can be explained in any other way. At long last we have had an assurance from the Minister, and I am grateful for that.

	<div class='title'>SCHEMES FOR REORGANISATION OF EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENTS: PROCEDURE, APPEAL, MAKING AND EFFECT</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that this Clause makes quite substantial changes to Sections 125 to 127 of the parent Act dealing with endowments. Endowments play a large part in education. I hope that the Minister will be able to say what the effect of these changes will be. I suggest this because it is the only opportunity other than Second Reading, when I do not think this was touched on, for the Government to explain why these proposals are introduced, and to explain to people administering educational endowments what the purpose of the change is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to give a brief explanation of what necessarily is a very complicated Clause. The Clause substitutes three new Sections for Sections 125, 126 and 127 of the 1962 Act, which</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, the Under-Secretary has still not dealt with the point that if these sackings take place, and if hundreds or perhaps thousands of teachers protest and refuse to re-register, they will be deprived of rights they have enjoyed in connection with dismissal under Section 85 of the 1962 Act. For that reason, and notwithstanding the Minister's assurance, I intend to press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 21, Noes 2.</p>

	<p>prescribed the procedure by which the Secretary of State may reorganise educational endowments. If hon. Members have been able to go through Clause 20 and the new Sections contained in it they will have seen that the procedures laid down in the Clause give a very much clearer statement of what is required in the reorganisation of an educational endowment. The present procedure is exceptionally complicated and has proved in practice very cumbersome and costly. We are simplifying the procedure in a number of ways while at the same time maintaining the essential safeguards for the interests of the governing bodies of the endowments and for those who benefit from them.</p>

	<p>Clause 21 is another part of the simplification by providing a shortened procedure for endowments of a rather greater value than is provided for under the present legislation, again with the aim of cutting out unnecessary elaboration.</p>

	<p>The present procedure of the 1962 Act for reorganising endowments may be described as follows. The Secretary of State, sometimes after a local inquiry, prepares and publishes a draft scheme. One month is then allowed for objections.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
The Secretary of State, after considering any objections, frames a scheme and publishes it. Then a further period of one month is allowed for objections. The Secretary of State, after considering any new objections, may confirm the scheme, or frame an amended scheme. As soon as he confirms a scheme the Secretary of State publishes a notice to that effect.</p>

	<p>Unless a petition is presented to the Secretary of State or to the Court of Session within a month, the scheme may be approved by Her Majesty by an Order in Council without being laid before Parliament. If a Petition is presented to the Secretary of State the scheme must be laid before both Houses of Parliament, and it is approved if no Address is presented within a month by either House. If a petition is presented to the Court of Session the Court may amend the scheme or make a new one.</p>

	<p>That, in summary, is what is involved in the present procedure. I have only to read it in that way to signify that it is a most complicated procedure. There is much to be said in the interests of the endowments and those who administer them for obtaining a much simplified procedure. Perhaps I may compare the new procedure with the old which I have described.</p>

	<p>Under the new procedure the Secretary of State prepares and publishes a draft scheme and one month is allowed for objections. If there are no objections the scheme can be made forthwith—that is the first change—by the Secretary of State by Statutory Instrument. Thus, in the simple case where there are no objections a second period of one month for representations is removed and the scheme is made immediately by Statutory Instrument.</p>

	<p>If there are objections the Secretary of State formulates reasoned replies, frames a scheme, and publishes it. One month is allowed for the presentation of a petition either to the Secretary of State praying that the scheme be laid before Parliament or to the Court of Session. The Secretary of State then makes the scheme by Statutory Instrument. If there is a petition to him the Statutory Instrument is laid before Parliament where it is subject to the negative resolution procedure. If a petition is presented to the Court of
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
Session the Court may amend the scheme, or make a new one. The second period of one month is eliminated, but the Secretary of State is required to formulate reasoned replies to the persons who made the objections and one month remains for the presentation of a petition to the Court of Session or to the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p>Another important change is that all schemes are made by Statutory Instrument instead of by Order in Council. The powers of the Court of Session to make and amend schemes remain unchanged, but in some cases the procedure allows non-controversial schemes to be made more quickly, and adequate safeguards remain for objections to be stated, considered, and taken into account in the framing of schemes, so that anyone interested in an endowment need not feel that the new procedure takes away any real rights.</p>

	<p>I do not expect the Committee to have followed with absolute understanding every word of what I have said because this is a very complicated procedure, but I hope that hon. Members will read what I have said. If there are points they wish to ask I can answer them now or on Report. The scheme is to relieve the cumbersomeness of the arrangements. I hope that it will be satisfactory to all concerned with educational endowments.</p>

	<p>I should give a warning that, in this very complicated field, I am not sure that we have got quite right the application of the new procedure to the powers that the Scottish Universities Committee of the Privy Council has. Its powers are similar to those of the Secretary of State in relation to university endowments, and it may be necessary to put forward Amendments on this on Report. We are concerned here with simplification.</p>

	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF S. 144 OF EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) ACT 1962</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With Amendment No. 57 it will be convenient to discuss Amendment No. 58, in Schedule 3, page 43, line 37, leave out 'subsections (2) and' and insert 'subsection'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will remember that we agreed to take Amendment No. 57 separately, in conjunction with Amendment No. 58. That is an Irishism in a Scottish Committee by an Englishman, so it should ensure swift dealing with the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 57, in page 29, line 19, leave out 'subsections (2) and' and insert 'subsection'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We started discussing this Amendment and Amendment No. 58 when we were discussing Clause 16. I do not propose to go over again what I said then. As the Minister will appreciate, we are trying to secure a guarantee of consultation between the Secretary of State and the institutions when regulations are made under Clause 16. I think I am right in saying that Clause 16 empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations in this context for the first time. It therefore represents a major change on the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State on Second Reading devoted so much of his speech as to take nearly four columns of HANSARD to the effect of Clause 16. It is only fair to call attention to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I give a firm assurance now that no regulations will be made under this Clause with regard to the constitution and the general functions of the governing bodies of central institutions before the existing bodies
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
have been fully consulted; and that goes for regulations made after the new bodies have been created, too"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21 January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 282.]</p></blockquote>
That was a clear assurance. I understand that a similar assurance was given in some discussions which have been held with the central institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to understand, in the light of that, why the terms of assurance have not been incorporated in the Bill. The Bill goes out of its way to do the reverse. By our Amendment we propose that Section 144(2) should continue to have effect, whereas this Clause 24 and the Schedule propose that subsection (2) should be deleted from the parent Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that Section 144(2) provides that not less than 40 days before making regulations the Secretary of State shall cause a draft of the regulations to be published and sent to every education authority. It also provides that the Secretary of State shall have regard to any representations made by an education authority or by any person interested before he makes the regulations. It seems that subsection (2) provides just the protection which the central institutions are seeking and which was conveyed to them and to the House in the Secretary of State's Second Reading speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fail to understand why the protection is being removed from the parent Act. The purpose of our Amendment is to preserve subsection (2), which provides in statutory form the assurance which the Secretary of State has given orally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Member directed his remarks specifically to the question of the central institutions under Clause 16, the Amendment goes very much further. It would restore the existing provision about the publication of draft regulations giving a 40-day period for representations to be made about those draft regulations. This would affect not only central institutions but a whole lot of other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present arrangement in Section 144 of the 1962 Act, which was introduced in the Education Act, 1945, is, so far as I can find, quite unique in our legislation either Scottish, English or Welsh. There is not any other piece of legislation, so far as I have been able to find, which says that there should be regulations published in draft before they are eventually
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
produced as actual regulations. No other Minister, including the Secretary of State in exercising his functions in any other capacity as distinct from his functions under the Education Acts, is under an obligation to publish draft regulations. I do not think I need go into the history of this and try to elicit why it was thought necessary in 1945 to introduce this complicated procedure. All I need say is that it is not repeated anywhere else, and this Government and previous Governments have produced dozens of Acts providing for regulations in which this particular safeguard—if that is what it is—does not appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business of producing draft regulations is a complicated one. It means that the procedure of promulgating regulations is very considerably delayed, and because of that we have to have Section 144(3) of the 1962 Act. That provides that, in certain circumstances, the Secretary of State may be able to make provisional regulations, simply because the circumstances do not allow him to go through this elaborate procedure involving the 40 days. That seems completely undesirable and unnecessary at present because it is part of the normal process of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give this assurance, not only in relation to the central institutions but in relation to teachers' organisations, local education authorities and everyone else. It is the normal practice at the moment, and will continue, to have consultation with interested bodies before regulations are actually published. That certainly will continue. That is the way in which we should ensure that the views of interested bodies are known before the regulations are actually published and eventually come into effect.

It is not necessary to have draft regulations to do this. This procedure i imply an elaboration of what is necessary and simply holds up the process of government in this field. In many cases, incidentally, it may be rather troublesome to Members of Parliament who are sent draft regulations and have to make certain representations about them as well as having to form a view on the actual regulations. There seems no reason why we should continue this cumbersome procedure. In this Clause we are eliminating it. I give the assur-
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
ance again that, obviously, we shall consult all the bodies interested before we produce regulations.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 144(2) of the Act means that, although we can take account of representations made by any person interested, the only people who are entitled to get a copy of the draft of the regulations, statutorily speaking, are the education authorities. This of itself would not include the central institutions nor the teachers' organisations. So one can produce regulations of tremendous importance to teaching without a statutory obligation to send them copies of the draft. In fact, we know that they get copies, and that if we did not send them they would get them for themselves. I say this to draw attention to the fact that existing legislation does not really meet the position, but that this Clause will. It does not detract from the rights of any outside body—education authorities, central institutions, teachers' organisations or anyone else—which may be affected by regulations coming forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise because I missed the first part of what was said by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). I and many others in the Committee have received a letter from the Glasgow and West of Scotland College of Domestic Science. The College appears to be worried about a statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland on Second Reading. If I read that letter, I hope that I shall not be repeating something already said in my absence. The letter refers to the words of my right hon. Friend on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I give a firm assurance now that no regulations will be made under this Clause with regard to the constitution and the general functions of the governing bodies of central institutions before the existing bodies have been fully consulted; and that goes for regulations after the new bodies have been created, too."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 282.]</p></blockquote>
The observation of the Secretary of the College is that no provision to this effect appears in the Bill. Do I take it that what my hon. Friend has just said to the leader of the Opposition——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Do I take it that what my hon. Friend said covers the fears expressed in that letter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am grateful to Under-Secretary of State for what he said, but I suspect that the defect in our Amendment diverted him somewhat from the main point. I accept that the Amendment goes too wide. It would not be my intention to require the publication of the draft regulations, but the hon. Gentleman will, no doubt, accept that that is the smallest part of the argument. Time and again there are tabled in Committee Amendments which may not be technically perfect but are on the Paper in order to call attention to certain points for discussion. That is the case now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I want to call attention to is the need to retain the statutory requirement that there should be a process of consultation. The hon. Gentleman based much of his argument on the point that, here and nowhere else, in Section 144(2), it is required that a draft of the regulations should be published and that a cumbersome procedure should take place. I do not want to argue that point. What concerns me is not the publication of draft regulations but the statutory requirement that consultation shall take place. As he himself agrees, in Statute after Statute a process of consultation is required. It is laid down over and over again that the Minister responsible shall have regard to representations made to him about a certain proposal. It appears to the central institutions and to me that by removing this part of Section 144 this form of statutory safeguard is being removed altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me unreasonable that this should be so, and in the light of the assurance the hon. Gentleman has given already to the central institutions, I cannot comprehend why the Government will not agree to the inclusion in the Bill of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
sort of protection which the Secretary of State has already given orally. I accept that the Amendment is defective but it would require only a small amendment to it to make it acceptable in the sense I suggest. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now comment on this matter, and I should be grateful if he would look at it again before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but I cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with that.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with the point in any case. I am making the point that, if there is an Amendment on the Paper which says a certain thing, I am entitled to assume that it means what it says and not something entirely different. In any case, the Amendment the hon. Gentleman tabled to Clause 16 was completely defective, as I said on Thursday, and would have had no effect.

with that sort of argument. He said last Thursday:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I had accurately interpreted what the Opposition's intention was in this matter."-—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 6th March, 1969; c. 588.]</p></blockquote>
I had already explained why we were proposing the Amendment. I only withdrew it on the clear assurance that he would deal with the point today. The point was clearly defined. He is being less than fair, and less than fair to his duty to this Committee, in trying to get round the point by calling attention to some technical defect in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is more than technically defective. It is defective from start to finish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Answer the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me. So far as Clause 16 and the central institutions are concerned, the hon. Gentleman will no doubt recall that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) raised this specific point on Clause 16, and that I dealt with it explicity then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, having put down an Amendment to restore Section 144(2), is saying that he is not really arguing about draft regulations and does not want reinstated any obligation on the Secretary of State to publish draft regulations. Far from this being a minor point about Clause 16, it is the major point, and if that is out of the way I am glad that no one in the Committee is disputing what the Government are doing about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with the comparatively narrow point of whether or not consultation, which will take place in any case, should be written into the Bill. That is different from the Amendment. If an Amendment had been put down—I do not want to be too hypothetical—to the effect that there should be a statutory obligation for consultation, obviously I would have considered it on its merits, but I would see considerable difficulty in accepting even an Amendment of that sort, although not as much difficulty as I would in accepting an Amendment to reinstate the provisions about draft regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
When one considers the variety of regulations we have to produce under the Education Acts and the very large number and variety of bodies interested in education legislation it is difficult to impose a statutory obligation on the Secretary of State to consult which either is not too restrictive, on the one side, so that large numbers of interested people are omitted from the process of consultation, or so wide a responsibility on the other hand that it becomes completely impossible. That is the difficulty about trying to put this in statutory form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that, without a statutory obligation being laid down, it is our intention, as it is the practice of the Government at the moment, and was the practice of our predecessors, to discuss proposed regulations with the bodies we consider to have a real interest in the content of the regulations. That will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware as a matter of practice that any of the organisations which may be rather unhappy about the absence of a specific obligation to consult have complained that, at present, they are left out of consultation on matters of interest to them. I can understand the apprehensions of central institutions as demonstrated by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), but these may be partly, at least, because these institutions, not having previously been involved or subject to regulations, are perhaps less aware of the normal procedures. The other organisations and institutions which are subject to regulations at the present time, and which do know what happens under them, would, I think, take the view that, whether it should be in the Bill or not, they are certainly consulted about regulations, and I repeat that that practice will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that the central institutions are primarily concerned about the regulations but they seem to be concerned about the words of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and if they have any doubts in their minds as expressed in the letter I received they reside in this sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I regard it as of fundamental importance that, before any regulations are made, there should be full consultation with any interested bodies."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st January, 1969; Vol. 776, c. 282.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
They are an interested body, and are, according to this letter, which includes that part of my right hon. Friend's speech on Second Reading, assured by him that such consultations will be provided for. Naturally, they are concerned that, so far as they understand the Bill, the Secretary of State has not had regard to his own promise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is misunderstanding. If he reads the full remarks of my right hon. Friend he will see that he was giving an assurance about consultation and explaining why that assurance was not, and should not be, written into the Bill. The two things go together. We have given an assurance about consultation, and I have repeated it this morning. I have also given reasons why I think that it would be undesirable to put that assurance, or a specific obligation about consultation, into the Bill. That does not mean that we have not met the point of the central institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has at last addressed himself to the central point of the argument. I am not satisfied that it would be inconvenient to introduce into the Bill the protection which the central institutions seek. I am in no way questioning the good faith of the assurance given by the Secretary of State on Second Reading, but it is reasonable that the good faith of that declaration should be reflected in the Bill. However, I protest most vigorously to the Minister for his approach to the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has been playing a form of devious catch-as-catch-can with us over the matter, and has totally ignored what was said last week and the terms of the assurance we were given, in the light of which I withdrew the Amendment we were then debating. I said then:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purpose of the main Amendment, No. 59, is simply to ask the Minister what proposals he has for consulting these institutions regarding any regulations which he may wish to make…. There is no provision, as I view it, in that Clause,"—</p></blockquote>
Clause 16—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for consultation with the institutions concerned. As the hon. Gentleman will know, there has been a substantial number of representations to hon. Members from institutions and colleges from all parts of Scotland, calling attention to their hope that a consultation

	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF SECTION 8 OF EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) ACT 1962</div> <!-- title -->
	<br><blockquote><p>In section 8 of the principal Act (which deals with the provision of religious instruction in schools) in subsection (2) after the words 'religious observance or', there shall be inserted the words 'reduce significantly the time devoted to'.—[
	<i>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</i>]</p></blockquote>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a small new Clause, but it is rather important, and I hope that despite the importance of time the Committee will give it careful consideration. It is promoted by hon. Members from each of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
parties in the Committee. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Gorbals (Mrs. Cullen) said that she was very sorry that an unavoidable engagement prevented her being here to speak to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing that unites us is a general concern about the quality of religious instruction in some of our schools and in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is a fear that once the Bill becomes law there will be nothing under the law to prevent any local authority from reducing the amount of time devoted to religious instruction to negligible proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third thing which concerns us is, the views expressed by individuals and groups that religious instruction could be removed without difficulty from the curricula of schools, and that this might be advisable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to dwell too much on the existing provision in the 1962 Act. The Minister might rightly say that some parts of the Act have no meaning in practice; but we (should realise precisely what the situation is and the extent to which the position could be abused as the law stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we intend under the new Clause—and nothing more—is that if any local authority sought significantly to reduce the amount of time devoted to religious instruction and observance it would have to go through the Section 8 procedure. That means a poll of the electors in the locality, as is now provided for if any local authority wants to discontinue religious instruction or observance altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might take the view that as there has not been a poll since that provision was introduced this is not the best way of doing it. If he has alternative proposals as to how we might safeguard the position, those of us who propose the Amendment would give them every consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Scotland is quite different from that in England. Since 1872, when we first had legislation on the matter, the principle in all our education legislation has been that the Secretary of State should not have powers to interfere with religious instruction. This has been the basis of all legislation in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
troduced since then. Under Section 67(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1962, Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools are expressly prohibited from inspecting religious instruction and from examining pupils in religious knowledge, and no recommendations or suggestions are made by them which might be represented as an attempt to influence the character of religious instruction given in schools. It therefore rests with school managers and education authorities, or, for grant-aided schools, the boards of governors, to decide how religious instruction should be given, and the arrangements are based on use and want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general practice, although it varies from area to area, is that the equivalent of two 40-minute periods is given for religious instruction, and there are morning assemblies, special church services and classroom instruction. The syllabus adopted is at least influenced by the Joint Committee on Religious Instruction, the Association of Directors of Education and teachers of religious instruction in the Protestant schools. That is the position, but I do not feel that it is satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Religious instruction, which I feel is very important in an educational curriculum, is subject to no inspection by the Inspectors. There is no provision in the teacher-training Regulations for the training of teachers in religious instruction. No teacher is forced to undertake R.I. work in the schools, and this is as it should be. It is also true that most of our colleges of education provide training in the teaching of R.I., but there is no legal provision in the (teacher-training Regulations for such training to be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor which marks out the Scottish position as rather different is that until the Scottish Examination Board was established it was illegal for examinations to be given in the S.C.E. in religious instruction in Scottish schools. All kinds of subjects, such as commerce, English, French, and so on, are examinable, but the S.C.E. Examination did not have religious instruction as one of the subjects which could be examined. The very small number of Scottish schools which regarded it as an examinable subject had to ensure that their pupils took the appropriate English examination. This is very different from the situation in England and Wales, for reasons arising from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
different ecclesiastical and educational backgrounds of these countries. South of the Border, Her Majesty's Inspectors have a responsibility for ensuring that religious instruction is provided in State schools, and the various G.C.E. examining boards conduct examinations in religious knowledge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it in order to range over the Inspectorate? The Amendment only asks that no less time should be spent on religious instruction. Are we to range over the Inspectorate, and the practices south of the Border, as compared with Scottish education? This is a Scottish Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is perfectly in order. He is relating Her Majesty's Inspectorate to religious instruction, to the powers to give it or not to give it.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. If I have been following the hon. Gentleman correctly, he has also introduced the question of examinations in religious knowledge. Never in my experience of Scottish education has that matter been embarked on. Now we are to be presented not merely with the problem of training teachers in religious instruction and the inspection of classes in religious knowledge but the suggestion that there should be examinations in religious knowledge. With respect, that is profoundly different from what I and many other hon. Members on both sides envisaged when we read the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. As I read the Amendment, no principle is in dispute. All that is before us is the time factor, that the time spent on religious instruction shall not be significantly reduced. There is no principle at all involved for Scottish education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be quite specific about this. I rule that the hon. Member is perfectly in order. He is obviously arguing that there is some risk in reducing the time because of the matters which he has specified. I said that he was using them as an analogy, and not as a statement of fact with regard to Scottish education. He is using them as

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a substantial difference between the legal provisions of Scotland and England. In England there is an Inspectorate looking at the subject. In Scotland there is not. In England, there is a statutory obligation laid upon the Secretary of State for Education to ensure that religious instruction is given. In Scotland there is a specific obligation not to interfere. In England and Wales religious instruction is an examinable subject. In 1963, for example, 72,000 candidates were presented for the O level——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Jennings, I mentioned the figures simply to show that my principle was accurate. I am grateful that you accept it as accurate, without my having to back it up with figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a situation in Scotland which is different from that in England. The main reason why this is the case is the existence of this deep-rooted feeling that the Secretary of State should not interfere. In a later part of the Bill—in Schedule 2, which we cannot discuss now—we are removing one of the few influences or controls which the Secretary of State has in this matter. It is laid down in Section 9 (2) of the 1962 Act, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The time or times during which any religious observance is practised or instruction in religious subjects is given at any meeting of the school shall be specified in a table approved by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That provision is being removed. The Secretary of State may say that in practice it is not a provision which matters or one which has been used. However, in the only legal control which exists, this one slender restraint is removed, and nothing is put in its place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scottish schools, therefore, it will become possible for a local authority, or for the schools, with the agreement of their local authority, to reduce to negligible proportions the amount of time given to religious instruction or religious observance. It is to deal with such a situation that this Amendment is moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter which concerns people of all religious denominations. It is of special concern to Roman Catholics, who are worried about the position where there are not separate schools and where the amount of time allocated for religious instruction may be drastically reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not tabled an Amendment to the Schedule. We have tried to do it in another way by this new Clause. Is it unreasonable to suggest that there should be some restraint on local authorities who may wish to reduce the amount of time devoted to religious instruction to negligible proportions? I feel that the subject, although not carried out perfectly in our schools at present—many would like to see improvements in the quality of religious instruction and in the training of those who have to give it—is one which is of such importance that, if the amount of time devoted to it were re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
duced substantially, it would interfere with the basic character of Scottish education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a free society. If there were any great feeling in an area that religious observance or religious instruction should not continue in schools, the people of the area should be able to make a decision on the matter. That is what we propose. We suggest that the electoral process should be used in such circumstances. Once this Bill becomes law, it will be possible for such a major change to be made without any restraint, apart from the influence which we have with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we have such a basic difference in our law? The main reason was the denominational differences of emphasis in different parts of Scotland. It was felt wrong that an Edinburgh-based Secretary of State should be able to make a major change or exert his will on Scottish schools. The ecumenical movement has largely removed many of these difficulties, but we on this side feel that no major change should be made without some kind of restraint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the new Clause is perfect. A lengthy electoral process is probably not the best way of dealing with the situation. However, it is important to have a restraint of some sort on local authorities who may wish to take such a step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Humanist lobby is one which has grown. This is a matter which Humanists have been pressing for some time, saying that religious instruction should not be given in our schools. I believe that religious instruction is very much in this no man's land. It is a subject which is taught in almost all schools, but in Scotland it is not subject to inspection, control and the rest of it. We feel that the time has come to have a review of the structure of religious instruction in Scottish schools, and I hope that the new Clause will cause the Minister to put forward some proposals and give us an idea of what is in his mind. I had a long correspondence with the right Lady who is now Paymaster-General. She showed a great interest in this matter and she indicated that she had some proposals in mind. The new Clause may be imperfectly drafted and may not be the best way of doing the job, but I hope that it will cause something to be done.

Religious instruction and religious observance are important parts of our general education. It would be wrong to pass this Bill without a saving Clause directed at a local authority which might consider reducing to negligible proportions the time devoted to the subject. It is an important principle, and I hope that we shall have an indication from the hon. Gentleman that he intends to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in this difficulty. I have been able to discover nothing in my correspondence or anywhere to suggest that there is any attempt in this free society to reduce the provision of religious education. When I have doubts about any matter, I like to see concrete evidence before me. I do not like to hear these sorts of suspicions directed at local authorities, most of whose members are either parents or grandparents with children or grandchildren in the schools. In any event, I cannot understand the heat which has been engendered on this matter, and it is all the more surprising when one recalls the great claim of the Opposition that most local authorities are Tory-dominated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor). I would like to see more religious instruction in our schools, because I have no doubt that humanity has been more influenced by the great faiths and philosophies of mankind than by anything else. It is significant that all these faiths arose
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
in the East. None of them springs from Europe or the Common Market countries——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Anyone knowing me will know that the last three words fascinate me. However, we cannot go into the birth places of religions, be they in Europe or elsewhere. If we stick to the Clause, we shall make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is vitally important, bearing in mind the influence that Christianity and other religions have had on mankind, for our children to know about the subject. A knowledge of these matters would be of more use to them in after life than anything that they do about cooking up strange mixtures in test tubes and operating slide rules. We should not alter the present provisions. The Secretary of State would be well advised to leave them in the 1962 Act as they are, and not remove them by the Schedule, as he proposes. I am not sure what has influenced the Secretary of State in proposing this amendment. I would ask the Committee to look at the matter carefully, because our children should have every opportunity to learn about religious faiths and stand by the eternal verities which served our forefathers so well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Jolly good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied that all hon. Members realise the object of the new Clause, which is to ensure that religious education is not significantly reduced. Most people in Scotland attach great importance to religious instruction, particularly if the subject is taught sympathetically. A small minority of teachers are not sympathetic to this subject, but the overwhelming majority of teachers are anxious to teach religion and are sympathetic in their teaching of it. It should be carried on as long as we have teachers who are sympathetic to religious instruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the Highlands often have inspections by local church ministers and others of our religious instruction. The heads of the various denominations visit schools; these visits are of an informal character
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
and are enjoyed by pupils and teachers alike. They are not strict inspections in the "inspection" sense. They are designed to give encouragement and I hope, therefore, that there will not be a diminution in the amount of time allotted to religious instruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many pupils have told me they were greatly indebted to the teachers for religious instruction in schools. A number of pupils from homes where the environment was not sympathetic to the subject have told me they were indebted for the instruction received in the classroom. I hope the subject will have the same importance as in the past attached to it. We do not need to get hot under the collar while debating it. I shall be interested to hear the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In supporting the new Clause I will not explain why religious instruction is important, since that ground was covered admirably by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison). If it was right under the 1962 Act, as I believe it was, to provide the terms of Section 8(2), it must be equally right now to provide the added protection which the new Clause proposes; namely, that there should not be a significant reduction in the time devoted to religious instruction without the machinery of subsection (2) being invoked. This is particularly important in view of the proposal of the Government later in the Bill that Section 9(2) should be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would find it difficult to accept the argument of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Scotstoun (Mr. Small) that there is here some slight on local authorities. The new Clause represents nothing of the kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is merely a reasonable extension of Section 8(2) of the Act, There was no slight in that Measure and there is no slight in this proposal. It is merely an added protection. If a parent has a profound moral objection to his child receiving religious instruction, he is free under Section 9(1) to withdraw the child from instruction, and the relevant provision states clearly that the child should not suffer any disadvantage in the school as a result of that action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur). There is, by the new Clause, an attempt, either deliberately or innocently, to interfere with the teaching of religious instruction in Scottish schools because it uses the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"reduce significantly the time devoted to".</p></blockquote>
There is an allegation there that something is afoot which will significantly reduce the time devoted to religious instruction. If not, why is the new Clause worded in that way? If there is something afoot, we should have been given an indication of where the changes are going on and in what spheres. But no such threat is apparent and therefore the new Clause has little meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Religious instruction in Scottish schools is at present given all the attention it requires. I fear that the new Clause would lead to an interference with school timetables. At one time, religious instruction was given as the first lesson in the morning. Timetables are now arranged in a different way, and religious instruction must take its place, like all other subjects on the curriculum, and be given at the moot convenient time. If we are not careful we may find ourselves doing something which has previously been condemned; namely, interfering too closely in the work of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the danger that once we start legislating in this way we may destroy a principle which has existed for many years. It arose because children come from homes of various denominations and from homes in which there may be no religious outlook at all. Children in this latter group may find themselves in a sphere of conflict, because if the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) has his way—we gather this not only from his speech but from his actions since then—religious instruction might become a compulsory subject in the school curriculum, and that could offend a great many thinking people in Scotland. We in Scotland believe in religious toleration and this is highly prized by us. I hope that nothing will be done to interfere with it. Although we do not have time to discuss the matter in detail—I would be prepared to do so on another occasion; I will accept the challenge at any time—we must recognise that some children come from homes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
where there is no particular religious belief. These parents must retain the freedom that they have had in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman read Section 8 of the 1962 Act, which makes it crystal clear that there is an absolute liberty for parents to opt in this matter, that their children need not have religious instruction, and that the new Clause would not interfere with that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. Nevertheless, once we embark on the course set by the hon. Gentleman we are in danger. Religious instruction is best handled by the local education authorities. They have done it efficiently in the past and I am sure they will continue doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the opposition which the new Clause has generated and I had hoped that it would be accepted. I appreciate that that was probably too much to have hoped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am indebted to the British Humanist Association, the attachment to whose opinions has significantly reduced the chances of the Labour Party being re-elected, as a result of some of the Measures which the Government have introduced on the Humanist principle. I am indebted to this Association for drawing my attention to some words which were used by the Secretary of State for Education recently. The quotation is obviously meant, from the Association's point of view, as being in favour of the Humanist approach, but the words are nevertheless important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. Would you explain, Mr. Jennings, what all this has to do with whether or not we should accept a new Clause prohibiting any reduction in the time devoted to religious instruction?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, like me, the right hon. Gentleman will be patient and wait, we shall see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have saved me the trouble of admonishing my right hon. Friend, Mr. Jennings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education said on 10th January 1969:
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is the point at which all who care about the preservation of the Christian character of our country must man the barricades. If we do not do so, within two generations Britain will cease to be a Christian country. We need the articulate support of parents throughout Britain to withstand the tremendous pressure for abolition."</p></blockquote>
I accept that in this Bill we are not talking in terms of abolition of religious education, and that we are merely refering to the amount of time devoted to religious instruction; and, of course, we are not speaking of Catholic schools, but I recollect that, as the Chairman of the Schools Committee in Glasgow, we had to take rigorous action against a headmaster who was a member of the Communist Party and who arranged for the daily reading of his pupils to be the Soviet Weekly and similar material. Those who imagine that the Communist Party confines its activities to political meetings and eating away the foundations of our industrial structure are living in Cloud Cuckoo Land. It can happen that such a man can become a headmaster of a school and attract to that school the type of people with whom he associates outside, and have little or no religious instruction given there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I made reference to ecumenism. Are we going towards an ecumenical society, and are we to have the Christian religion as our concept? To reduce religious instruction would be the best way to undermine the structure. If we are to repeal Section 9(2) we should promise to do something on Report to guarantee that religious instruction will not be significantly reduced, and I would hope the Minister would say something in favour of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my unavoidable absence earlier from this debate, and that I did not hear all the arguments on the new Clause. While many of us sympathise with the intentions behind this Clause it would seem that the inclusion of the word "significant "would render the new Clause almost meaningless in its implementation. What is significant to one local authority may not be significant to another. Adopting this Clause would do no more than suggest that we in this Committee think that religious education is important. It would not, as I see it, circumscribe the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
right of local authorities to reduce the amount of religious instruction by what amount they wish to. Unless the Clause were quite substantially redrafted it would not help to achieve the end which those supporting it want to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before coming to the merits of the new Clause I make two preliminary points. First, quite apart from the considerations of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), the new Clause is technically defective. I need not go into the reasons for that because I do not place importance on it and I understand what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it would be undesirable for us to introduce a new Clause of this sort without consultation with the local authority Associations and religious organisations, and there has been no consultation. For that reason alone I could not ask the Committee to accept the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) said that he had had representations, but no representations have been made to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly have had representations about the Schedule—from the Church of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Millan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not come to that yet. The hon. Member interrupts me before I have even got to the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no consultation about this new Clause. I do not think there is any doubt about that. This new Clause has not been put forward because some outside body asked the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart to put it on the Notice Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that we are dealing with this matter as a new Clause rather than on the proposal in the Schedule for the elimination of section 9(2) of the 1962 Act. That has been referred to so often that I must be permitted to say one or two things about it. I understand that the reason why this new Clause was moved is that the hon. Member for Glas-
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
gow, Cathcart is unhappy about the elimination of Section 9(2) of the 1962 Act and wants to put something in the Bill in its place. The Church of Scotland recently asked us to explain why we are providing for the elimination of that subsection. We shall be meeting the appropriate committee within a few days to explain these matters. Obviously if the Church of Scotland wants to object it will let the Government and also Members of the committee know its views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why Section 9(2) is to be eliminated by the Schedule. It is worth investigating the history of the subsection, because it is not what it might appear to be from a reading of the Act at present—some kind of protection to those who want the minimum amount of religious instruction to be given in schools. The history is entirely the opposite. Hon. Members will have noticed that it is included in the "conscience clause" and goes back to the Act of 1872.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of interest, yesterday I took the trouble to read the Second Reading debates on the 1872 Bill which dealt very largely with religious education. I read the House of Commons debate and also the House of Lords debate to satisfy myself on this point. While a number of hon. Members at that time wanted some provision to be put into the legislation to provide for the minimum amount of religious instruction, the particular provision was to separate religious from secular instruction so that for those who were against having religious instruction at all it would be seen that the public purse would not be charged for giving religious instruction as distinct from secular instruction. Secondly, it was so that dissenting parents could withdraw their children from religious instruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall read what the Duke of Argyll said when he was moving the Second Reading of the Bill in 1872. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A timetable Conscience Clause was therefore necessary—this being merely a regulation that any religious instruction should be given at certain definite hours—that the children of Dissenting parents might be withdrawn; for if it were mixed up with secular instruction, Parliament would have no security that such scruples would be respected."—[Report of Debates, 
	<i>House of Lords,</i> 5th July, 1872; Vol. 212, c. 683.]</p></blockquote>
It was interesting to have the recollections of my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) on this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
point. It was the custom for religious instruction to come at the start of the day so that it could be effectively separated from secular instruction, but the provisions of Section 9(2) have not been operated for many years. We have not any information that the Secretary of State has ever asked authorities to submit timetables to him in accordance with the Act. Section 9(2) is not being eliminated because the Government wish to attack or to reduce religious instruction, but because it is an obsolete provision which has not been used for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the actual terms of the new Clause, of course I understand why the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart put it down and why some hon. Members have supported him, but I must reject any implication there may have been in any speech that somehow or other the Government have been influenced by the Humanists or any other kind of outside body. There has been no representation on this Bill from any Humanist body whatever. It should be said that not only have we not been influenced but we have not had any representations from any Humanist body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause is defective in terms of clarity, and defective as my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland pointed out. It is defective also because it would impose existing standards of religious instruction in schools at the present time and so on as standards to be maintained in future. That is the only sense in which one could judge whether the amount of religious instruction had been reduced or increased significantly. One has to have a standard by which to judge that. Standards vary considerably from one school to another and perhaps from one area to another. There is no way now of finding what the standards are by which one can judge the efficacy of the implementation of such a Clause. The hon. Member is trying to produce something which is impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unfortunate if there were any implication that it is necessary to have a Clause of this sort because education authorities are reducing significantly the amount of religious instruction in schools at present. It is not my view that that is happening and not my information that it is happening. Even to move the
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
Clause rather suggests that it is happening. That would be very undesirable. For all these reasons the Clause is quite defective and I must ask the Committee to reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end on this positive note—I am not talking about Roman Catholic schools where different considerations apply and nothing we are dealing with here would make any difference to them. Those who know the existing practice and safeguards in non-denominational schools are not satisfied about the way in which moral and religious education—I use that term explicitly—is carried out. We are unhappy about what happens in schools at present. For that reason the Secretary of State recently established a committee on moral and religious education to look into the whole question of non-denominational schools with the existing statutory background and retaining that background. That committee, under Professor Miller of Aberdeen University, is working at present. The Secretary of State and I look forward very much to its recommendations. That is the way to tackle any doubts we may have about the situation in the schools in relation to religious education or moral education generally at the moment. That is the way in which the Secretary of State has decided to tackle it. I need hardly say that the committee includes ministers of the Church of Scotland and others with a religious background which makes them acceptable to religious organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I appreciate and accept absolutely the good will and good intentions of hon. Members who have spoken in support of the Clause, it would be a great mistake to pass it. I must, therefore, ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
