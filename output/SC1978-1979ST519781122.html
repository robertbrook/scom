	<div class='legislation'>IRISH SEA HERRING (PROHIBITION OF FISHING) ORDER 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Irish Sea Herring (Prohibition of Fishing) Order 1978 (S.I. No. 1374).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if with this we were to take the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>Haddock (North Sea) Licensing Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Haddock (Restrictions on Landing) (Revocation) Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>West Coast Haddock (Restrictions on Landing) Order 1978.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Mackerel Licensing (Variation) Order 1978.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter Clegg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. May I take it, from the form in which we have received the orders, that whilst they are available to us they are not available to the general public? If that is so it seems remarkable that we are discussing orders which interested parties outside have never seen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. Does the Minister wish to comment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so, Mr. Blenkinsop. I had expected that the orders would have publicity in the same way as other orders have in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. May I ask when these orders appeared in the Vote Office? I went there three days ago to get them and was given completely different ones. They are typewritten because we have had trouble with the Stationery Office, but I should like to know whether the Minister can tell us when they were available. Perhaps he could make some inquiries and let us know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. My
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) has made a relevant point. It is fair enough that we in the Committee have access to the orders, but it is also very important for those in the industry and others affected by the orders to know their terms, so that representations may be made to us and we may have the briefing we need if we are to put forward views in Committee. It is important that we know whether the orders have been made available to those who are affected by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter has a direct relevance to our debates in Committee. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will receive sufficient information to be able to enlighten us, so that we may know on what basis we can proceed. It would be nonsense to go ahead with these proceedings if those who affected by them are still in the dark about the orders. Any enlightenment from the Minister would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter. I understand that at the time the orders were laid the fishing organisations were informed about them. I understand that a Press notice has been issued as well, and that would have had the usual circulation in the media.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister is not trying to persuade the Committee that a Press notice is the equivalent of a printed statutory instrument which is available to the public through the Stationery Office and available in the Vote Office. All of us who have fishing constituencies know perfectly well that the information is very properly conveyed to those immediately concerned at the time. But I do not think it ought to pass for the Minister to pretend that that is an answer to the question which has been raised in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. The Minister said that the orders were made available in one form or another to fishing organisations. With respect, that is not adequate. As his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland knows, this is a point to which I have constantly returned. One cannot assume that all fishermen are automatically members of official organisations or that they are active in them. Whilst one would like to see everything possible circulated
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
through such organisations, we are asking too much if we expect each individual fisherman who might be affected to have access to them in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are assuming too much if we think that the matter of information and availability of the orders is covered simply by circulation to fishing organisations. Therefore, we want rather more assurance than the Minister has given so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. I have been coming to Committes such as this for a year or two, and this is the first time I have heard the matter mentioned. Is what has been described unusual? Has it ever happened before? If it has, one has heard nothing about it. Is there something special about the orders that is causing us to have this—I will not say " demo "—concerted demonstration now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clegg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. I think that the difference is that we have come to the Committees before with the proper statutory instrument that is available to people outside. The orders before us are not in the form that a printed statutory instrument takes. That is the difference, and that is why we are asking for something to be done about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. Opposition Members are perfectly entitled to raise the general principle, which arises not out of a fishing problem but out of an industrial dispute at the Stationery Office. The assurance that the Committee seeks is fair. I do not know the answer to the question whether, and in what form, copies of the orders were available to people and bodies other than the organisations involved in the consultations. But that is a separate issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the provision of information to fishermen, as the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) knows perfectly well, since 11th September they have been operating a system that flows from the orders, so I have no doubt that all fishermen know what the orders contain. That does not answer the question of principle concerning the lack of availability of the orders, but I can say that the sheer
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
practical application of the orders is well known and understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Blenkinsop. The Under-Secretary has referred to an industrial dispute at Her Majesty's Stationery Office. We have been suffering from this form of industrial dispute for three years. It has thoroughly disorganised the work of Members of Parliament. There is a motion on the Order Paper about it, and I very much hope that the Minister will convey our dissatisfaction to members of the Cabinet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should take the opportunity of saying that I have made some inquiries, and I can now say that the orders were available in the Vote Office, certainly at the beginning of this week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that one piece of information that the Minister owes to the Committee—admittedly, he is not directly responsible for the industrial action—is to state whether the statutory instrument before us has ever been printed. It would be a serious matter if we discovered on 22nd November that a statutory instrument made on 20th September had never beeen printed. That ought to give rise to more far-reaching inquiry than we can make, or that it would be sensible to make, this morning in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been instances recently where documents which have once been printed were not able to be replaced for the use of the House in printed form. That would be to some extent different. But if it is the case that these orders have never been printed, and have never been available since they were made available to Her Majesty's Stationery Office, that is something of which wider note ought to be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I state what I understand to be the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are the difficulties to which the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and others have referred and on which you have commented, Mr. Blenkinsop, I understand that we have followed the procedure that we have always adopted, which is to notify the fisheries organisations and the industry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
generally. They have their own media. There have also been the press notices. For instance, there was the notice dated 24th October, regarding the new mackerel fishery licensing arrangements, which draws attention to some of the provisions of the order, gives the details of the order and states that the order is available. Indeed, on 20th November we put out a Press notice headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Third Country Fishing Within British Fishery Limit".</p></blockquote>
which described an order under the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. It set out roughly what the order said and required, and contained a note for editors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My information is that the orders we are debating have been dealt with in the same way as orders have been dealt with over a long period. I certainly take note of the Committee's concern. The matter is important, but we have had to deal with the difficulties arising out of the dispute to which reference has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Chairman, I am concerned first and foremost, of course, with the availability of papers to hon. Members. There are precedents for this matter. There is no doubt that the papers have been available for hon. Members in the Vote Office as from the beginning of this week. Therefore it is within the general competence of the Committee to proceed. It is perfectly proper that the matter has been raised. No doubt hon. Members can find other ways of continuing their inquiries about the matter, as they are competent to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friends were absolutely right to raise the points that they did. Quite apart from the fact that the printing difficulties are impeding the work of Members of Parliament on important issues such as this, there is also the fact that the shambles over the provision of documents adds further uncertainty to an industry which is already facing a great deal of uncertainty. For that reason we very much regret the situation and hope that steps will be taken to try to prevent these difficulties arising in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attendance of hon. Members in this Committee—sometimes our Committees are not well attended when we
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
are considering Statutory Instruments of this sort—shows how important to the industry as a whole and to those concerned for the interests of our fishing communities are the general issues behind the orders. We have before us a total of five orders. Although I doubt that many of us will have objections in principle to the idea of conservation which lies behind the orders, there is no doubt that many of us are most concerned. Unquestionably these measures will add to the hardship which existing conservation measures have caused to our industry and to those who process fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the industry has supported such measures shows the commitment of the British industry to maintaining our fish stocks, but it would be wrong for the Government to disregard the fact that all these conservation measures cause hardship to British fishermen and to those who process fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three questions for the Minister arising out of the orders. First, as we have been waiting for a very long time, will the Minister make a statement on whether the Government plan to make further efforts to help the fish processors who are being hard hit by the conservation measures limiting the amount of fishing being done? A number of firms have suffered a great deal. We have had redundancies and further problems are arising as the temporary employment subsidy is being phased out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This problem has not arisen suddenly. It is one about which the Government have been well warned. Is the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland able to give us some indication of whether he has any further plans to assist fish processors who are being hit very hard by conservation measures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point relates to the scope of the conservation measures before us. The Minister will be aware that, despite the hardship that the restrictions cause, the industry has been united in supporting conservation measures. Although it is true to say, as Mr. Gilbert Buchan said in the recently published Scottish Fishermen's Federation newsletter, that the problem of communications in such a scattered industry remains formidable, there is little doubt that the industry as a whole supports conservation measures and believes that in some respects they should be tightened up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Have the Government given consideration to adding to these conservation measures, and, in particular, will they reconsider the question of the suspension of the introduction of the 70 mm. net, together with the restriction which should have introduced the one net, one voyage rule. There is no doubt that the industry places a great deal of emphasis on the importance of the introduction of a one net rule, which would help to put an end to one of the biggest abuses of the net regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third general question relates to herring, which is dealt with in one of these orders in which further restrictions have been introduced. The industry supported the measures that the Government took on herring because of its concern about the elimination of the herring stock. Has further scientific consideration been given to the movement of herring stocks and is there any possibility of a limited quota being introduced for herring in the near future? This is a matter of particular importance to Scotland, where a great deal of hardship has been caused by the restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that, in general, the Opposition can say that, together with the industry, we wholly support the need for these orders. We believe that there is a need perhaps for the further tightening up of conservation by the introduction of the two further measures that I have indicated. I hope that the Government will be able to give us a clear assurance that, if we are unsuccessful in getting the kind of general agreement that the industry greatly needs in the discussions in the EEC, it will be the Government's intention to review the whole nature of our present conservation measures and to consider the introduction of further conservation measures—in particular, the one net rule and the 70 mm. minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, I hope that the Government will give us a full assurance that they will do all they possibly can to ensure that the negotiations upon which we are about to embark once again will result in a fair agreement for the industry as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first occasion on which we have had an opportunity to discuss any of these
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
matters since before the recess, and I agree with those who have called attention to the large attendance in Committee this morning and to the fact that two Ministers are present—perhaps because they know that one alone would not be able to cope with the fire which will come from various quarters, including possibly their own side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems with these orders —I have raised this on previous occasions —is seeing where they fit into an overall pattern. We have asked the Government previously—I hope that they will be able to say something today—what effect they think these orders are having in technical terms as well as in the political terms of playing our cards in relation to the common fisheries policy.

The herring fishermen in particular, the vast bulk of whom come from my constituency, have been diverted from their traditional fishing places because of various orders that have been made, but they have willingly and gladly supported the Government in measures to protect the herring stocks. They now want to know what effect these conservation measures are having on herring stocks. When will the Government tell them when they will be able to rteurn to their traditional fishing grounds? Much of the trouble about mackerel in recent weeks in Cornwall has arisen because fishing effort has been diverted there instead of elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specifically, I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the position in the Minch and when we may expect it to be open, even on a limited scale, for what fishing organisations have called a "survival quota" to tide over the herring fishermen for the next few months. Second, there is the question of the processors because the supply of fish is becoming uneven as a result of these measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall that during the sitting of the Sixth Standing Committee on 26th July this year I asked the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food about the processors. In reply he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We met the processors and the unions last week, and the processors put forward, with union support, a proposal for a special scheme of Government financial help, and we are considering that proposal urgently."—[
	<i>Official</i>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<i>Report, Sixth Standing Committee;</i> 26th July 1978, c. 23.]</p></blockquote>
The fact that that was four months ago may be a measure of the Government's degree of urgency in dealing with these matters. There was a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Banff (Mr. Watt) from the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Brown), in which the Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The herring processors have a difficulty over the supply of home-caught fish and we are considering urgently the request for help." —[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 16th November 1978; Vol. 958, c. 358–9.]</p></blockquote>
If the degree of urgency being shown by the Government on this occasion is commensurate with that which the Minister of State assured us was being shown on 26th July 1978, many of our processors and many of the jobs in the industry will be at severe risk over the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot on this occasion get away with saying "We are looking at the matter urgently." I want to know when we shall see some sort of scheme which will enable the processors to survive and which will be acceptable, at least until we see the impact and effect of any agreement on the common fisheries policy. Most people would accept that there is a strong case for a special scheme for the processors until we know the shape and nature of fishing that is to be undertaken when the common fisheries policy is renegotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask specifically: how urgent is urgent? Is the Under-Secretary's definition of urgent more urgent than that of the Minister, whose definition is at least four months and may even be longer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until we know what will happen in Brussels, it is extremely difficult to assess whether the Government are doing everything they could be doing about conservation. Most hon. Members with any knowledge of the fishing industry have supported these conservation measures in the past. We shall continue to support them, as the fishermen have supported them, but the Government must be more forthcoming on the effects which they are having and on the actions which they themselves intend to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly surprised to hear an old campaigner from East Aberdeen begin by talking about crossfire against our Ministers. It is unheard of in a Committee of this nature. One of the lesser pleasures of this Committee is the way in which the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Henderson) and I, and many others of course, are often of one mind on the matter of conservation and many others. One hears magic terms such as 70mm, one net-one voyage and so forth. There is no one at odds on this. We are together, and it is a good thing for the Minister, when he is with his colleagues in the EEC, to know that behind him he has East Aberdeen, Hull West and North and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Down, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the right hon. Gentleman's pardon. It is good for the Minister to know that we are behind him in this very important matter of fighting and standing our ground against, unfortunately, perhaps six, seven or eight opponents in this matter of conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservation is vital. I can hear colleagues whispering "Well, he can say that again". There is no future for a port such as Hull if we do not have conservation. We are having a bad enough time at present, and when I hear talk about processing and supplies of fish, I wonder who is worse off than we are in West Hull. We are now dependent upon old adversaries in the cod war to land fish—which we buy expensively, too—in our dock in West Hull where, formerly, we were employed in combatting their activities in their waters not so many years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a factory which is closing. We managed to salvage about 220 jobs out of some 300. It has been a fight. Imperial Foods Limited is what it is, but nevertheless with luck and the help of the Government we may be able to have a new factory not so far away, nearer the dock, and get our men out of the old one into the new one. But this depends, of course, on supplies of herring —herring back in the North Sea and being caught by men from Hull, Scarborough or even farther north, as long as it is caught by our fishermen in our waters
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
to be sold in our ports to give our men employment onshore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a headache to us all on Humberside. My hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) will speak in much more eloquent terms than I can about his difficulties on the south bank. I think that his people are better of than we are in some ways. Theirs is a more balanced port, while we depend on distant water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to end on this note about distant water vessels going to the south-west peninsula where we allegedly have millions of tons of mackerel. We have had our headaches with cod wars against aliens—if I may use that term about the Icelanders without offence—but our difficulty is that we are now clashing with our own people. When I find that a firm such as Tom Boyd in my constituency, with first-class skippers and first-class vessels, has without doubt, lost £? million in one effort off the west coast of Scotland attempting to catch blue whiting, I can appreciate why it has to turn elsewhere. Such firms are catching fish— and, to be open about it, they are doing well—off Falmouth, Camborne, St. Ives and such places. But, again, limits are vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister cares more than I do about this matter—if that is possible—but we must have limits about our shores into which nobody else may come. Line fishermen, local men in Devon and Cornwall, should be able to catch their fish as well as the larger boats out of Humberside or, indeed, from Fleetwood which may be down there and elsewhere, to catch mackerel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Committee is solidly behind the Government in their fight to get limits which will be 12 miles exclusive, not six. It is even more important to stake our claim—and not merely to stake it, but to win it—for a limit of up to 50 miles, or even beyond that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.56 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walter Clegg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first say to the Minister that I still do not regard as satisfactory the reply which he gave about the publication of these orders. This is a constitutional issue. In particular, the Minister did not reply to the matter raised by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) as to
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
whether the orders were ever printed and generally available. My reason for spending time on the matter is that these are punitive orders. If people break the orders they can be punished in the courts. If the law which sets up the limits which people may break is not available to individuals, it is a matter of which the House should take immediate cognisance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I move on to the effect of the orders. Can the Minister say how effective are the conservation orders and whether he is having any problems in enforcing them? For example, have there been any prosecutions of offenders against the orders since they came into effect? In particular, there is great concern at present about the depletion of mackerel stocks off the south-west coast caused by the methods of fishing carried on there, especially by the purse-seiners. One sees reports in the papers almost daily of dead mackerel flooding the south-west coast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the problem is that the dead mackerel are thrown back into the sea and are brought up with the fresh mackerel. The fishermen do not want to market such catches because, if their catch is mixed with the dead mackerel, they will get a very poor price. I should like an assurance about what is going on there. It is important to Fleetwood in my constituency because we have trawlers fishing off the south-west coast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the processors who are hit by a shortage of fish; it is the whole structure of the various fishing ports. It hits the lumpers who handle the fish and the merchants, too. The Committee needs to know how effective these measures are proving, what sort of time limits on the orders are likely, when fishing will start again, and what is happening to the stocks under these conservation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are beginning to get a better picture of what the fishing effort of this country is likely to be in the future with regard to the deep water fleet. Whether we are inside or outside the Common Market, the old ground which deep water vessels used are pretty well denied to them. There are a few off Norway, but practically nothing off Iceland. When we first heard of the move out to a 200-mile limit, we had all hoped that we should have enough herring to be able to trade off fishing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
rights with Norway and Iceland for herring against white fish. I do not know what is the prospect of that happening. It does not look easy to me at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his right hon. Friend cannot delay much longer in considering the steps needed to take the industry over this difficult period, a period which has been forced on the industry by matters extraneous to it. It is not through the industry's own inefficiency that it is experiencing the present difficult conditions. Has the Minister in prospect some means of defining the likely future and, having defined it, has he any measures that he is likely to bring forward to help the industry and get it over this difficult period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) who opened the debate for the Opposition said, these are all conservation measures and therefore, broadly speaking, acceptable to both sides of the Committee. We should also keep in mind that they bear hardly on many of our fishermen and on the processing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask certain detailed questions on only two of the orders, and I shall then get on to the more important and general question of conservation, its effects, and our relationship with the European Economic Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order on herring fishing is particularly important, as we must preserve the herring stocks. I repeat the questions already asked from this side of the Committee. When does the Minister believe that the stocks will revive? My hon. Friend the Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) made the point that we depend on the herring stocks also to make deals with third-party countries. The distant water fleet is pretty well decimated at the moment, and until the swap arrangements can be made with Norway and other countries it faces a dangerous future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is our position with regard to the EEC on this herring order? Is this the one that it disapproves of? What is the present state of affairs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the mackerel order, I warned the Committee two years ago that I felt the time would come when there would be a conflict of interest between
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the inshore vessels fishing in the southwest of England and the distant water vessels. The more the distant water vessels are prohibited from fishing in their traditional waters—Iceland, the White Sea, Newfoundland and Greenland—the more they will concentrate on home waters. As a result, a clash of interests will come between the inshore vessels fishing in those areas and distance water vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One provision of this order says that vessels over 60 ft. are prohibited from fishing within three miles of the coasts of Devon and the Channel Islands. That, presumably, is a move towards regulating the differences between the inshore fishermen and the Scottish and Humber distant water vessels that are abusing the mackerel fisheries now, as they have nothing else to exploit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order refers to discarding fish at sea, a particularly important point. I believe that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would deplore the practice of catching fish and then throwing it back, which pollutes the sea and is extremely dangerous for the future of our fisheries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just mentioned three miles as a limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what is said in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but is it not a fact that mackerel are such that they are caught by our vessels off the Humber and by many others? Are they not found between three miles and nine miles, so that that will in no way inhibit our people —I say " our people", but the hon. Gentleman and I know what I am talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has made that point, which I hope the Minister will clarify, as I believe that there will be increasing difficulty between the local people and the distant water vessels which come there to fish off their shores, be it three miles, nine miles or 12 miles. This is an issue that must be cleared up by the Government before there are major differences between these two types of British fishermen, both of whom have right on their side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I turn now to the broader scope of the orders which are designed for conservation of fisheries and in some way affect the future of any common fisheries policy. The industry has been worried that there will be a sell-out by the Government on the common fisheries policy. I quote the 
	<i>Fishing News</i> of 3rd November, under the heading "Is this the Sell-out"?—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Suddenly, after five years of wrangling, there is an almost indecent haste by the British Government to get a Common Fisheries Policy agreed before the German presidency of the EEC Council of Ministers ends on December 31."</p></blockquote>
In the same paper there is a long interview with Josef Ertl, the president of the EEC Council of Ministers at present, who is hoping to get some of the problems that we have been discussing for so long in this Committee settled before his presidency ends at the end of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given us privately certain assurances on this, and the right hon. Gentleman can take it that we accept these assurances. I hope, however, that they will be repeated in the Committee today, because it is very important that the rumour that has gone round the industry should be scotched if it is, as I believe it to be, untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the industry wants, and what I hope the Minister is working for, is a 12-miles exclusive zone for British fishermen, with a phasing out of the historic rights, and proper conservation measures —some of which we are discussing now— up to 200 miles. That means measures to extend the existing pout box, agreement on a minimum mesh size and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cath-cart has already said, if possible—I accept that this is the most difficult to negotiate —one net, one voyage, because that is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It means also that we should have proper fishing plans and licensing for the 12 to 50 miles. Licensing is mentioned in the orders, but I believe it is important that licensing should be by the name of the ship and by the time it is allowed in certain areas, not by catch quotas which can never be controlled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is saying is extremely important. Can he confirm whether Conservative policy has changed over the exclusive 50-mile limit to the terms he has described today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) that we are moving slightly outside the strict terms of the orders themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Blenkin-sop. On the other hand, these are conservation orders and I am talking about the general purpose of conservation. I add just one other point, if I may, in reply to the hon. Gentleman's question. The Conservative Party has always backed the industry in its demand for a 50-mile exclusive zone. Only history will show whether such a demand is obtainable. We hope it will be, but the Government already seem to be moving away from that particular line. It is an ideal that we should all aim for, but whether it will be obtainable I do not know. At least, the Government should give us some idea of what we should be allowed in the 12 to 50 or 200-mile zone—whether it is 45 per cent., as the industry wants, or 50 per cent, which has been mentioned, or what. We should be given some clue of the lines on which the Government are negotiating at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the orders go part of the way but not far enough. I believe that the Minister is putting up a good fight, and we have backed him in his fight. The industry has clearly said that it wants the right answer and is prepared to wait for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I must remind the Committee that the longer we wait the fewer distant water vessels will remain. Already seven of 22 Hull freshers have not operated at all this year, and many others have been tied up for long periods of time. I am sure that the hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) has the same story to tell in Grimsby. As we move towards 1982 and the trawl line which is supposed to be the fisheries limit, time is not on our side. I hope that the Minister can reassure us that, as we support these orders, the Government will continue the fight. I want him to tell us what Government's aim is. Obviously, there is to be some sort of compromise, and I want the Minister to tell us what sort of compromise they are fighting for and—most important of all—when they expect to obtain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.9 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow what my hon. Friend the Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
about the availability of papers by referring to one point of principle. I know that the Minister is not responsible for the present difficulty over the distribution to those concerned of the papers and the orders in printed form, but I fear that we may slide into tending increasingly to accept without protest that the papers are not available, because of disputes, and seeing people put in the position of breaking the law without necessarily knowing that they are doing so. I make that point in passing. It is important that we register such matters on these occasions because deep principles are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) said about the orders. What we want to see is the eventual satisfactory renegotiation of the common fisheries policy, but one is sometimes left with a feeling of some concern. In an interview published a week or so ago, Herr Ertl, the German Minister of Agriculture and current chairman of the Council of Ministers, showed no apparent understanding of the conservation nature of the orders. That is what worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee has achieved only one thing, it has demonstrated that British fishermen and the British processing industry are suffering as a result of such orders. It is a sacrifice which both industries are prepared to accept because they believe it is necessary for the longer-term viability of the fishing industry. Therefore, I hope that we have demonstrated that the orders are not discriminatory and that British fishermen are making a sacrifice every bit as great as that of those foreign fishermen who may have been fishing previously in the waters covered by the orders and are now being prevented from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sooner this message goes over to those responsible in other nations for renegotiation of the common fisheries policy, the better, because it indicates the strength of our resolve, that we are playing the game by the rules, that we are playing properly and are prepared to make sacrifices for the higher good in the longer term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart mentioned the interim problems that the industry faces while we have orders such as these until we see the com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
mon fisheries policy renegotiated. He mentioned fish processors and all of us know their problems from representations made to us, particularly from herring fish processors. There have been a number of meetings with the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland during the summer. I know that he has done his best to reassure them, but, as he knows, they are still very worried, and will be as long as the orders continue, about precisely what the future will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is worried that as a result of such orders we may see jobs lost and firms going out of business. When we eventually, as we all hope, reap the benefits of the orders, with fish stocks restored and more fish available for the British industry to catch, we shall be left with this question: what kind of processing industry, what kind of catching industry shall we have ready for that situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the fish processing industry. I should like to repeat the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. Johnson): what is happening to our fishing fleet? My hon. Friend described the position in Hull. I remind the Committee that in the past week or two the Boyd Line has closed down its subsidiary of William Liston in Granton, the one remaining deep-sea fishing firm in Granton, which was once a flourishing fishing port in Scotland. That means that the last fishing fleet is removed from that port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is significant and relevant to the order is that with William Liston closing down its operation Granton has lost five side trawlers and two stern trawlers, amounting to about 150 jobs. This, is serious. I know that hon. Gentlemen realise that in a place such as Granton it is most unlikely that the industry will return, even if, as a result of the orders, we achieve a more successful and viable fishing industry in the future. Some of the boats were losing up to £2,000 a day, despite the attempt to, as the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West said, divert into other species such as blue whiting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The particular point that I want to put to the Minister is this. What concerns me, whether in relation to processing or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
catching, is that the British fishing industry is suffering. What is significant is that the EEC, in the realisation that we shall come out of the new common fisheries policy with a new type of industry, has already put forward certain proposals for restructuring the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that at this stage of negotiation we cannot be absolutely certain for what we should be restructuring the industry. I do not ask the Government for a policy setting out precisely what they intend to do to restructure the industry as a result of the measures we are taking. But it is significant that some of our partners in the EEC, particularly West Germany, are introducing interim measures to help those firms and fishermen that are affected by orders of this type, pending the outcome of the common fisheries policy negotiations. It is significant that West Germany is doing that, but, so far, the British Government have set their face against it, saying that we must wait until we see the results of renegotiation. The industry has to tighten its belt and accept the kind of measures that we are now discussing and their consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me, and I think worries us all—as I said a moment ago in relation to processing—is the question what sort of industry we shall be left with once the orders are no longer temporary but are put on a more permanent basis and a new common fisheries policy is renegotiated. Shall we be left with an industry that can, on both the catching and the processing side, take full advantage of what the new policy may offer us?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I say with great sincerity that as long as we carry on with a temporary situation, with orders like this, we must be much more constructive and positive in relation to interim measures. Otherwise, we shall see jobs going to the wall in the processing industry and in the catching industry. As I mentioned in relation to Granton, my concern is that we shall see a whole fishing port wiped out. Boats will not necessarily go back again to these places. It is important, therefore, that we should try to keep alive a viable industry ready to meet the situation once the common fisheries policy is renegotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Ministers will give us an indication that, particularly if nego-
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
tiations are prolonged and we have to go on debating these interim measures, they will give the industry some hope of its remaining viable and alive to meet the new situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal with some of the matters that have been raised this morning, Mr. Blenkinsop, and then if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland catches your eye, he will be able to deal with some of the other aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the orders being considered by the Committee provide what I think the industry will accept is further evidence of the Government's determination, despite the absence of any Community agreement on quotas, to maintain their responsible attitude on the conservation of fish stocks which are in short supply. This point has rightly been made already by various members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members have indicated, we have the full support of the House in these matters. We have steadfastly refused to agree to quota proposals Which do not adequately reflect the United Kingdom's participation and what we regard as our just rights in particular fisheries—and which do not take proper account of the contribution to present stocks which our attitude to conservation has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable, as I am sure others will agree, that not all other countries have followed the example that we have set on conservation. That is important, as we are talking about having an industry able to exploit fish stocks, but the stocks must be there to be exploited, whether by the United Kingdom or by other member countries. We believe that there is no reason why those mainly responsible for present shortages should not, in the shape of smaller quotas, bear the brunt of the repercussions of their own past neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Irish Sea Herring (Prohibition of Fishing) Order 1978 prohibited from 24th September all fishing for Irish Sea herring within British sea fishery limits. The Government were satisfied that, by that date, the recommended total allowable catch of 9,000 tonnes had already been taken and that further fishing would have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
damaged the stock which is already at risk. The Government believe that this unilateral measure was fully consistent with the scientific advice, and the United Kingdom industry, which has the predominant interest in this fishery, has agreed that the closure was necessary to safeguard future stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a little background to show the Committee how we are standing up to the Commission in looking after our own industry's interests. In its 1977 report ICES recommended a total allowable catch of 12,500 tonnes for Irish Sea herring in 1978. On the basis of this the Commission put forward a proposal for 1978 allocating quotas to those member States with traditional fishing rights in the fishery—that is, the United Kingdom, the Irish Republic, the Netherlands and France. Historically, the United Kingdom share of this fishery has been 90 per cent., but the Commission proposed only 74 per cent, for the United Kingdom. My right hon. Friend the Minister has said that this share is unacceptable. Here is another instance where we have stood firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In May 1978 ICES revised the TAC downwards to 9,000 tonnes. In spite of the requests from the United Kingdom to amend its proposals in the light of this and of the United Kingdom's historic share in the fishery, the Commission failed to table any new proposals. In order to ensure that the TAC of 9,000 tonnes for the fishery was not exceeded, the Government sought on 17th August the Commission's approval for a national measure. This regulated fishing for the main 1978 season in the fishery by means of a licensing scheme for United Kingdom and Isle of Man vessels to take not more than 8,100 tonnes, and a closure of the fishery no later than 24th September for the remainder of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the Commission has recently challenged the United Kingdom's measure under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome, on the grounds that its introduction was contrary to Community law. The Government will be replying shortly to the Commission. The Government are satisfied that this measure is justified and fully consistent with scientific advice and is in the best interests of conservation. Of course, we shall reply in full shortly to

the Commission's 43-page letter of observations. This is another example of the way in which we believe that the stand we have taken has been justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves the subject, will he say what has been the reaction of the Irish Government to these proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be able to supply that information later. It is a point which is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points made by one or two hon. Members about the mackerel situation. The variation order was introduced to exempt handliners and vessels of under 40ft registered length from the need to have a licence before fishing for mackerel. It seemed desirable to remove this requirement from these small vessels. It relieves them of a burden and also frees some administrative effort for the enforcement of the conditions applying to the vessels which continue to be subject to licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions were asked about the six-mile belt. We are very conscious of the pleas which have been made for a six-mile belt off the south-west coast. Here we have a fishery for which several conflicting United Kingdom interests are competing. We can well understand the point of view of the local fishermen. On the other hand, these are United Kingdom waters, and there are other sections of our fleet which, for a variety of reasons have lost fishing opportunities elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the United Kingdom catch is in practice taken within three to six miles of the coast. Although mackerel can be caught further out, catch rates are rather uncertain. United Kingdom vessels excluded from fishing within six miles of the coast might find it difficult to maintain an economic fishery for mackerel. I know that this has been a matter of concern, because it is one of a number of points that have been made by hon. Members, especially those representing the south-west area. While we obviously do not want this stock to be over-exploited, we also would not want to see the United Kingdom failing to exploit the stock as fully as possible, consistent with conservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have greatly increased the sanctions against 60ft vessels which fish for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
mackerel within three miles. Our protection forces are making a special effort to police this limit. At this stage I believe that we should let the present balance of arrangements have a chance to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Observations on pollution and dumping at sea were made by the Select Committee. We have replied to them and to the other 60 or so observations which were put to the Ministry. I was sorry to see the recent reports of dumped mackerel being found dead on the sea bed. As well as visiting other ports, I have visited ports in the south-west and I know how strongly fishermen feel on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry's inspectorate has been following up the reports and contacting the fishermen concerned, but unfortunately it is virtually impossible to enforce effectively a ban on dumping at sea. However, I believe that we can look for co-operation by the fishermen to try to avoid further incidents of this sort, and I assure the Committee that we shall keep the matter under review. It is undoubtedly a practice to be deplored, but the problem is how to enforce a ban against it. There are technical difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been proposals to prohibit fishing for mackerel off the south-west coast for a period from 1st March each year. We are looking into them. There is not much evidence on the grounds of conservation, but the possibility of a limited closure applying only to United Kingdom vessels is a matter that we shall consider in the light of the development of United Kingdom catches during the winter's fishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he hoped to stop the practice of dumping dead fish, yet in the order he has not taken the power to do so. Can he explain why he has not done that, and how he hopes to stop the practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recommend the hon. Member to read in full our reply to the Select Committee's observations. One of the problems is that of enforcement and whether there should be a restriction in licensing. It would be no good making provisions that we could not enforce. However, the practice is deplored by the industry itself, and that should act as a discouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
There are technical difficulties of knowing when people have slipped their nets. It would be necessary to be very close— probably on the same side of the vessel —to see whether a net had been slipped. When the slipping took place the day before and a fisherman picked up a catch which was already dead or suffering from earlier slippage, if a ban were in force he would be prohibited from dumping that catch. That is another problem in relation to the quota concerned. We have the matter under review, although, as we say in the reply, it is difficult to enforce a ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) spoke about "one net, one voyage" and asked whether we should press for a ban on the carriage of large and small mesh nets on the same voyage. So long as fishermen are allowed to carry on the same voyage small mesh nets normally used for industrial fishing and large mesh nets, we shall have enforcement difficulties. The current EEC proposals stand open to abuse. For example, if a fisherman can carry two nets he can always claim that the wet small mesh net had just been used in another zone from which he had just come and where its use was allowed. Without a rule prescribing one net for one voyage there will be a legal loophole allowing skippers to use small mesh nets to catch white fish and then claim that the fish had been taken with a large mesh net which the vessel was also carrying. Our own industry is very much behind us in insisting that a proper solution be found, We have the matter in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Community and the United Kingdom national measures, I have already made the point about the herring measure being one which has in effect been challenged by the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has challenged certain conservation measures which the Government have recently introduced. In particular, we have been asked to justify our extension of the Norway pout box —a matter raised by the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall)—and our management of the Isle of Man and Mourne herring fisheries. I was pleased to see that the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) was here, because my right hon. Friend and I have both been to the area concerned to discuss
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
these matters with the Mourne fishermen and we have done our best to help them with their special problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another proposal which is of interest is the proposal to introduce 70 mm mesh nets for all nephrops fished within the British fishing limits. My right hon. Friend announced on 30th October that the Government had decided to defer introduction of the measure until after the meeting of the Fisheries Council which takes place tomorrow. We did this in the hope that we should help to provide an atmosphere in which an acceptable settlement of the CFP could be reached. We are currently engaged in correspondence with the Commission about the other measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already indicated our stand on the question of unilateral action to safeguard fish stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have rightly raised the question of the Government's position with regard to the CFP generally. My right hon. Friend keeps the House and the industry very much in touch with what is happening. I understand that there was a meeting of the all-party fisheries group last week, which unfortunately I could not attend as I had Ministry engagements elsewhere. We value these contacts with the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Talks have taken place with the Presidency from which there appears to be a willingness to try for a settlement before the end of the year. We are cautiously hopeful that progress can be made at the Fisheries Council to be held on 23rd and 24th November. I must make it clear that—I think this is the assurance that we have been asked for—we have not abandoned our objectives and are very willing to sit down and discuss how these objectives can be achieved. Hon. Members who were present at Question Time last Thursday heard the Minister reiterating his stand on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members raised several other matters about support for the industry and so on. My hon. Friend will be able to deal with them if he catches your eye, Mr. Blenkinsop. Meanwhile, I can say that we are indicating to the industry that in advance of a proper, reasonable and fair settlement of the common fisheries policy we shall do all we can to ensure
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
that the industry takes advantage of the agreement that is finally reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.31 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Arising out of what the right hon. Gentleman has just said, I am sure that the Committee would wish to urge him to stand firm on the matter of Irish herring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will be able to tell us whether we are in agreement with our EEC partners on the question of the limited amount of fishing for herring inside the Clyde. I seem to remember that we got into conflict on that question and it would be helpful if we could be brought up to date on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have mentioned our inability to introduce a measure to stop discarding fish at sea. I hope that the Department will continue to study this question. When we suffered from oil pollution we used to say that it was very difficult to discover where the oil came from. There should be ways and means of finding out where discarding has occurred. At least if it were made illegal to dump dead fish at sea there would be the right to do something about it if someone were caught. If no action is taken to make it illegal, people are at perfect liberty to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads me on to another question of general conservation that we should consider carefully. Are we happy about the development of further purse seine net fishing? Are we to allow people to spend money on very expensive equipment and then possibly to find that we have to tell them that they cannot use it? I remember when I first came to the House the sort of trouble we ran into when we banned drift netting for salmon at sea, with people saying that they had spent fortunes on buying the nets and felt that they had been very hard done by. I have heard people say that the fact of fishing with a purse net and the fact that the catch can be slipped should be an advantage, but I wonder whether there is scientific proof of this. I hope that we can hear more about that, though not necessarily today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other three orders, Statutory Instruments nos. 1285, 1286 and 1287—deal with haddock fishing. Not much has been said about this matter so far in the Committee. I understand that there is another
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
order—Statutory Instrument no. 1413— which is not available in the Vote Office or in the Library, because someone has apparently nicked the file copy. I have a note from the Library saying "I am sorry, but our file copy is missing." It may be up here already. The order deals with fishing for haddock off Rockall. Although it is not due for discussion, I hope that as it refers to haddock the Under-Secretary will mention it in passing to keep us informed as to what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection, we would also like to know whether the conservation methods that have been employed in controlling fishing for haddock are meeting with success. As has been said in this Committee by almost everyone every time we have discussed these matters, as soon as fishing for one species is banned, the pressure is at once put on another. In this connection, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West, (Mr. Johnson) has told us about people's failure to be able to diversify into blue mackerel—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Blue whiting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. Is there a possibility that fishing for blue mackerel for industrial purposes—[HON. MEMBERS: "Whiting."]—I am getting colour blind, I am sorry. Is it possible that this could be fished for industrial purposes? If we ban one we put pressure on another species, so although the British fishing industry has always prided itself on being keen to fish for human consumption, shall not we have to go towards industrial fishing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I should tell the Committee that the catch of blue whiting was sold for £X a ton for the purpose the hon. Gentleman has mentioned—for fertiliser—because the fish were riddled with worms. So here is another headache—there is this million-ton species yield but so much of it is not up to standard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir John Gilmour</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that information. White Fish Authority reports over the past year indicate that so much faith has been put on the idea that we could transfer into fishing for this blue species that it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
very sad if we find that it will not be a practical measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland could tell us something else with regard to fishing boats. From a recent issue of 
	<i>Fishing News</i> we learn that there have been orders for four new fishing boats placed in Scotland to the value of£2¼ million, which is good news, that it appears that one, if not two of these boats will not qualify for White Fish Authority grant. This is worrying, especially when one thinks of the amount of money involved in boat building nowadays. If there is to be a restriction on grants from the White Fish Authority, the effect on the boat building industry gives cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From all the discussions on conservation that we have had I think that what has clearly emerged is that the Opposition Members of this Committee stand firmly on what we have said all along, that no change of Government, when it comes, will make any difference to the type of negotiation and stance which the British will take in renegotiating the common fisheries policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.37 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Hugh D. Brown)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is for the convenience of the Committee if I speak now. I am always conscious that perhaps Ministers take far too long to reply, but we decided to divide this discussion between mackerel, herring and haddock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been the usual interesting debate. I think I am right in saying that you, Mr. Blenkinsop, have not presided over our deliberations on fishing before, and I can only compliment you on your tolerance and the fact that we managed to ignore the orders while hopefully trying to keep within the rules. There are special circumstances about fishing, and no hon. Member has objected to the tolerance shown; it has all been done in a nondiscriminatory manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those hon. Members who have not taken part in the discussion—my hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) and the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell)—are known for their interest in this matter. To some extent, our business here is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
safety valve, saving time on the Floor of the House, because the Committee expresses the general interest in fishing affairs, the urgency of them and the fact that they may be reaching a climax— although we have been saying that for the past couple of years. We hope that we are getting nearer to decisions which will be acceptable to most hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise again about the printing of the orders. My information is that the orders have not been printed or, if they have been printed, they have not been available. That does not satisfy anybody —certainly not the supreme constitutionalist the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell)—but I assure the Committee that those who are operating the orders have had the information. I think that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) will confirm that, unlike the occasion for argument about the size of net meshes in the past when there was some local disagreement, lack of information has not applied in this case, and to the best of our knowledge there has been no difficulty in advising the industry of the contents of the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister at least pass on to the Lord President of the Council the Committee's views? It is a long-standing complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I do not want to be too provocative, but it does not always help to draw attention to these problems. Hon. Members must appreciate that perhaps they are doing the very thing that those who are involved in an industrial dispute want. Nevertheless, I give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I know his reactionary tendencies in other affairs, and I have to respond to that. [HON. MEMBERS: "Order."] The fact that hon. Members say things so pleasantly does not conceal from me what they are really getting at. Let us not overdo it. I am saying merely that sometimes to draw attention to something which is well known to those who are negotiating does not necessarily help what we have in mind. I have given the assurance that the Lord President will be advised of the further difficulties that the fishing industry has suffered—not, as you have rightly pointed out, Mr. Blenkinsop, the Members of the House and the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
I have a further provocative remark. I rather take exception—it seems out of keeping with the atmosphere in the Committee and the valid worries that have been expressed—to the tone of the British trawling industry's documents that have been issued to all hon. Members at great expense, in which it is said that fishermen have heard all this before and that they have
	<br><blockquote><p>"an equally understandable suspicion, founded on bitter experience, that when the initiatives stem from the top they might yet be sold out for some intangible diplomatic advantage or even the benefit of some politically more powerful sector of the United Kingdom community."</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? Does it mean that there is some suggestion that my right hon. Friends who will be in Brussels on Thursday and Friday will sell out for some "diplomatic advantage"? What does that mean? Or does some " politically more powerful sector of the United Kingdom community " mean the Transport and General Workers' union—or, if not, what does it mean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is relevant in these orders, because it is one thing to have polite, constructive and helpful discussions in Committee, but hon. Members have to go outside to talk to their constituents, and I do not think that that kind of extreme, exaggerated mistrustful language helps anybody in the present circumstances. I rather resent such superficial snide remarks, which are in deep contrast to the knowledgeable comments and criticisms legitimately made by members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has read one paragraph of the document. If he had taken the trouble to read the next he would have seen that it dealt basically with the point he himself made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did read the next paragraph. In that case, it would seem entirely superfluous to put in the paragraph which I have quoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be better to stick to the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I had better return to the orders and some of the questions which were asked, which presumably were in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take first the difficulty for the herring processors. I am sorry that I cannot
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
announce anything on this extremely troublesome problem. The herring processors are in receipt of temporary employment subsidy, but some are nearing the end of that benefit and some are going on to the reduced rate for another six months. Temporary employment subsidy, as hon. Members know, was never intended to meet such a situation. I am not making excuses. I am merely stating an obvious fact. We have examined the problem carefully, and there is no joy in temporary employment subsidy. I have explained this personally to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then looked at the powers under the Industry Act. After all, the Government can work only within the powers that Parliament has given them. But the powers under the Industry Act are not adequate. Members of Parliament as well as the industry are pressing for some new form of Government assistance, for which we have no powers at present, to meet a one-off situation. I am not apologising; I am merely saying that the one-off situation arises simply because the fishing industry has problems caused by a shortage of raw material—for how long, we do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that background, it is extremely difficult to evolve a formula within the powers that the Government have to provide the right answer to the undoubted problems in the industry. I cannot go further than that. I shall not even say that we are looking at the matter urgently. Of course we are. Neither shall I try to define what the word "urgent" means. I am saying that the problem is still with us. We have not said "No" finally, and I am hopeful that we may be able to evolve something to meet the situation. I repeat that it is certainly not an easy one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the Minister that the situation is not easy. However, I think that the Government have had rather a long time to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first factory in my constituency went on temporary employment subsidy in August 1977. I raised the matter with the Government then. I welcome the help that has been given in the way of temporary employment subsidy, and I do not gainsay the benefit that has been to the industry, but these factories are coming off TES now. We were reasonable in putting a construction on the words of
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
the Minister of State in July 1978 that he was considering the problem urgently, but surely that is not good enough today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not taking the point I was making. Of course the matter is urgent in financial terms. We have had discussions with the industry, and it is doubtful whether even the temporary employment subsidy was intended to meet this kind of situation. Therefore the hon. Gentleman should not exaggerate or make play of the fact that there has been delay. There has been real financial assistance to the industry where we have stretched the temporary employment subsidy rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that temporary employment subsidy was introduced to enable firms to restructure and become more viable. That does not apply in the processing industry for the very reasons that I have given. I accept completely that we have an obligation to find ways in which we can give help, and I repeat the assurance that we are still looking at it and hope to be able to come up with something fairly soon. If the answer is "No", it will be not because we do not want to help but because we do not have powers under existing legislation. But I am not saying "Yes" or "No" now. We are still looking at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may think that that is not a satisfactory reply. It is not. It is satisfactory only in the sense that I am not saying "No" at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That matter is related to the other point raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Taylor) about a possible limited quota for herring in Scotland in the near future. The answer at the moment to that question is "No". It is a persuasive argument, and of course fishermen always know better than anyone else. They say that stocks may be recovering and that it would do no harm to have a limited catch in the Minch, in particular. I am sorry, but for both scientific reasons and reasons of presentation it would be most unfortunate if it were thought in EEC circles that our industry was so desperate that it was willing to breach or go against what at the moment is sound scientific evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) asked about Cylde herring. We have a similar difficulty there. Fishing will be continuing, but we have been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
asked to supply the scientific evidence to justfy our claim that it is a separate stock. We have done that and the matter rests there. There will be Clyde herring available, mainly for Clyde fishermen, next year as there has been this year. That is the state of play at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the other questions have been answered by my right hon. Friend. The hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) raised one of the most important questions: Why are we not restructuring our industry when, apparently, other countries in the EEC are doing so? I can only say, first, that obviously each industry in each country is different. The approach of each Government may be different, and I would not have thought that the need for restructuring was the major problem at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hard, cold economic facts of the future of the fishing industry—I am sorry to have to say this to my hon. Friends whose constituencies are bearing the brunt of the troubles—seem to point to a diminution in deep-sea or long-distance catching effort. Everyone accepts that, including the unions that are involved. They have been marvellous in their responsibility as we have a real problem here. But it is still not clear. There are too many imponderables as well as the negotiating situation which also is difficult. There are too many imponderables for us to make dramatic pronouncements about what help might be available for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there will need to be discussion about what form assistance might take in the fairly near future in an effort to ensure that we have an industry that will match the availability of fish, where it is, and the kind of fish, depending on the settlement of the common fisheries policy. So it comes back to a matter of judgment as to whether we should go overboard to try to evolve structural changes within the industry that perhaps might not be the right ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to score a debating point—certainly not with the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns—but I think it is a slight exaggeration on the part of the firm operating out of Granton to say that if it had had the same assistance as the West German Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
were giving it might still be in existence. That is, at most, a debatable point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the feelings of people who have gone out of business after a liftime of operating from a port such as Granton. But, again, I think that Granton must be included in the category of Grimsby and Hull which have been hard hit by the change in the fishing opportunities around our shores. It is one of the facts of life that we have to accept with some regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to conclude by referring to some of the interesting points that always seem to be raised by the hon. Member for Fife, East. I seldom know the answers to his questions, whether on agriculture or on fishing. My right hon. Friend had a go at answering the one about the dead fish and I shall not attempt to improve on what he said. I do not want to take advantage of the fact that there is no hon. Members from the south-west here at the moment but, at best, there is some doubt about the stories coming out of the southwest. I do not want to be too nationalistic, because I know that the other side of the coin is that everyone is talking about the pirates from Scotland. There are genuine problems that concern all of us, and what my right hon. Friend said was perfectly true: we are aware of the problem and we are concerned about it. It does no good to have fishermen fighting with fishermen. We have enough problems on our hands without that. I am sure that good sense will prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for blue whiting and industrial fishing, there are problems here but nevertheless it is a resource that is available and one that we should exploit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot comment on the Rockall order. I must confess that I am not the one who pinched it from the Library, or I might have been able to comment on it. I am sure that it has something to do with the west coast restriction and haddock catching, but I shall send an answer to the hon. Member in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as regards the sum of£2¼ million for four new boats, I have no detailed information. I do not know why two should get grant and two should not, but I shall look into that and advise the hon. Member. In general terms, it highlights the difficulty in the industry. Do we restructure? Without being smug and complacent, I can say that the fishing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
fleet, and particularly the Scottish fishing fleet, is reasonably modern and efficient. Nevertheless, there should be some replacement even in a period of restriction, so there is nothing inconsistent in a few new boats being built with grants. The question is: why have only two got a grant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful debate, but I am surprised that one point has not been raised. I shall give this gratuitously. I cannot guarantee that it will be this week, but we are reaching a period when there is a possibility of reaching some kind of agreement. The hon. Member for Cath-cart was unusually fair in what he asked for. He asked for an assurance that there would be a fair agreement. That is the most temperate language I have ever heard from the hon. Member on any subject. But I appreciate that, as there is no question of a sell-out. We think that we have improved the negotiating atmosphere. That is all that I could claim on behalf of my right hon. Friends as of today. What will happen, or whether or not the atmosphere will change, I do not know, but for us to continue as we are doing to press for exclusive 12-mile limits with the problems of phasing out of historic rights—and what is a historic right?—for us to be going for some kind of access preference, to put it no higher than that, without talking about 50 miles or anything else —for us to define that and be within Community thinking is a difficult exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that there is absolutely no doubt about our determination to get a good agreement, and there is no doubt, as I have said before, that the combination of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland makes a formidable team for negotiating skills, stubbornness and cleverness. Therefore, all I can promise is that we want not to be tough but to fight hard to get a fair settlement. I think that we have the knowledge and the skills to reach one, and I am delighted that we have the support, by and large, of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give one other assurance. There is a real problem—I am sure that the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns was involved in negotiations—in that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
have to get the support and the backing of the industry for whatever agreement is put before us. We have also to get the support and backing of the House. How we advise the House, whether before the settlement or after, is a difficult problem in a negotiating situation, and I hope that hon. Members will be sympathetic in the way in which we shall do our best to communicate with the House on what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
