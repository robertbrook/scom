	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Council Tax (Transitional Reduction Scheme) (Scotland) Regulations 1993 (S.I., 1993, No. 277).</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart</div> <!-- memberconstituency -->)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends might want me to speak at length, but I shall have to disappoint them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tursday, the council tax will be implemented in Scotland, After the debacle of the poll tax—I hope that even the Minister agrees with that view—we have the council tax. Measured against the poll tax, anything would have been an improvement on that system of raising local government finance. However, concerns have been expressed in Scotland about the tax and the provisions that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are cushioning high-value properties in Scotland by developing the banding system. The highest value property will pay no more than three times the basic rate. The high-value properties had their component capped by the Government to ensure that the outcry expected by the Conservatives before the general election did not occur. That is the reality of the banding system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people in Scotland do not yet know what band their houses are in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. I must confess that even my regional council in Fife has given no information about what band our properties will be in. The Minister looks askance at that remark. There are few regions where householders have been advised of their valuation band. Clearly, with only two days before implementation of the council tax, that is a worry. I suspect that local authorities, not the Government, will be inundated with appeals against valuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capping of high-value property caused a great deal of disbelief. The tax was not based entirely on the ability to pay but was caught up in the Government's political expediency before the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also disquiet about the transitional scheme. Few properties, if any, in the A, B and C categories will benefit. The Minister might want to comment on that. Householders in the upper-value properties will benefit from the £25 million that has been set aside by the Government for the transitional scheme. I should welcome the Government's comments because, if we are talking about a system of local government finance in which the ability to pay is uppermost, the scheme smacks of a transitional component which will benefit the well-off at the expense of those at the bottom of bands A, B and C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
At a time of crisis in local government caused by the Government's half-baked scheme for reform and the more absurd notion of privatising water, this should be a time for spending money wisely. Although £25 million may not be a significant amount, it could be better used to invest in jobs, and, more important, in services. There is a delicate balance between central Government and local government, and there should have been much wider discussions about this scheme. That is the view of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which feels that, at a time of stringency, a priority should have been given to any available cash. That does not seem to be reflected in these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it is a bit early for the Minister, but he is always up to challenges. I can see him smiling already at the possibility of explaining how the amounts that are payable in transitional relief will be calculated. I hope that his brief will extend to a layman's interpretation of pages 3 and 4 of the regulations. The Minister is nodding. I hope that that means that we shall have an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations are always complex. However, I would like the Minister to explain simply how they will affect council tax payers. How will the amount be calculated? Will the Minister confirm my fear that the regulations will help people at the higher-value end of the property market in Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will want to reflect on the growing concern about the inconsistent way in which properties are valued and banded. That inconsistency has surfaced in the press in the past few days. Perhaps the Minister will comment briefly on the guidance that has been given from central Government to local government about how to achieve a consistent pattern of valuations throughout Scotland. From what I gather, inconsistencies arise not within particular local authority areas but in particular streets. My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) has asked a question about streets in his constituency, where properties seem to have been valued inconsistently. That inconsistency has created not only local anomalies but local anger about how the tax has been implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useful to use the Committee as a forum to voice these concerns. Had the Government taken more time in considering the replacement for the poll tax, some of the inconsistencies, anomalies and injustices that will arise from the council tax could have been avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rates were scrapped because of Conservatives' concern about revaluation. The poll tax was scrapped because of the monumental mess that was inflicted by the then Prime Minister and, at extraordinary cost, VAT was hiked up to get us out of that mess. We now have a council tax which, instead of being a well-thought-out programme of how best to shape local government finance in the 1990s, was born of political expediency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to allay some of our fears and, in particular, to deal with the issue of money being spent to featherbed those of the upper end of the valuation bands who, in our judgment, do not need extra financial assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.38 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to respond to those questions. I recognise that it is right and proper for the hon. Gentleman to use this procedure to explore exactly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
how the scheme will work, but I was a little surprised that the Opposition chose to table a prayer against the scheme in Scotland but not the scheme in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a very good answer to that but I shall not burden the Minister with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall accept that the hon. Gentleman has an extremely good answer to that point and pass on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I answer the hon. Gentleman's points on the details of the scheme, could I refer to his more general but related points? First, I assure him that information on banding is available in his local government office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine, but it is not good enough. During the passage of the Local Government (Finance) Bill, we tried to insist that notice should be sent to each individual about his or her own banding. But the vast majority will find out about their banding only when they receive their bill. Presumably it will tell them into which band they fall, at which point the appeals will start. Is a person then obliged to pay the bill, which would mean that, if he won his appeal in perhaps two or three years' time, the council would have to repay any money that is due—that would cause the local authority problems—or will he pay the lower amount and have to pay money to the local authority if he loses the appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with the transitional relief scheme. As under the present system, people have to pay the full amount of the tax levied on them. Since December, people have been able to appeal informally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The levying authority has the discretion to inform people about banding. I thought that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) favoured giving local authorities discretion. The provisional fist has been available for some time, but the final bands will be notified on the bills. The hon. Gentleman is correct on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that my hon. Friend's point is not connected with transitional relief, but page 4 of the regulations shows that, as part of the complex formula that has been devised to calculate the amount payable, the "S" factor relates to an amount that is specified against each valuation heading. Therefore, in a sense, my hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart is right. The initial figure for transitional relief has a bearing on the valuation, which can subsequently be changed if it is successfully challenged on appeal. Will the Minister comment on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm—I think that he has so far failed to do so—whether a responsibility was placed on local authorities to issue valuations before levying the amount? That simply has not happened. I should be especially worried if the Government were not properly overseeing that aspect of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point about appeals, perhaps I may confirm what I said. Initially, people pay the full bill and, if an appeal is successful, authorities are obliged to repay the amounts that were overpaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the duties placed on authorities. The provisional lists—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I realise that the hon. Gentleman is very active this morning, but perhaps first I may respond to the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Provisional lists have been available since December. Under the Local Government (Finance) Act 1992, local authorities have discretion to inform people about the bands and some, I think, were—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But no duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but I thought that opposition Members favoured giving local authorities discretion, as a matter of general principle. If not, that is surely a major philosophical U-turn for Opposition Members. Some local authorities—I believe that Lothian was one—used that discretion specifically to inform people of the banding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central raised a general point about the inconsistencies in some of the valuations. In some streets, it would appear that a council house that has been sold has been put into a higher band than a council house that remains with a sitting tenant. Will the Minister explain that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. The hon. Member for Fife, Central raised the point. We appreciate the Labour party's new concern for council tenants who have purchased their properties. I am glad that the hon. Member for Cathcart has leapt to their defence. The Local Government (Finance) Act provides the valuation principles. It is for assessors to defend values on appeal. Neither I, as junior Minister, nor my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can intervene in an assessor's professional judgment. I hope that Opposition Members are not suggesting that politicians should intervene in the professional judgments of Scottish assessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody could call the Minister professional.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is related specifically to the council tax or to the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked me to deal with the underlying rationale for the regulations. I was surprised that in criticising the new system he did not pay tribute to the immense amount of work that local authorities do to ensure that the council tax is effectively and successfully implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one knows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the evidence shows that it will work very well. It was always inevitable that there would be winners and losers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central, asked about facts and figures. As all authorities have set their taxes, we estimate that on the basis of the full bills which will be issued, 1.2 million households, or 58 per cent. of all dwellings, will be better off under the council tax than under the community charge. Another 15 per cent. will lose less than £1 a week. The great majority of households will be better off or will not be disadvantaged or will experience no significant change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some people the local tax burden will be higher under the council tax. I think that is is generally accepted that transition to the new regime must be eased. We are doing so by limiting the increase in what a household must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
pay because of the change in the tax system. Because of transitional increases in the burden, the scheme is not a general-benefit scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister says that the scheme is not a general-benefit scheme, does he mean that each household must claim it—that it will not be given automatically to a household for which the increase is more than the relevant amount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member, who has anticipated an important point that I was to make later. We see no problem in making the scheme automatic. The basic principles were circulated to local authorities several months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme provides for relief in cases where a household's council tax bill exceeds its final aggregate community charge bill by more than a threshold amount. That is clearly set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked how the system will work. That is set out in detail in the regulations. We decided that it would be reasonable for those in the higher bands who face higher tax bills to pay a higher initial amount during the transition to the full bill. In that sense, the scheme is progressive. For that reason, the threshold amounts rise in even steps from £91 a year, or £1.75 a week, in band A up to £182 a year, or £3.50 a week in band H.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the transitional relief scheme operate on the gross amount due on a property or on the discounted amount due for a single person household?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the discounted amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of the scheme tax figure is the lowest of three options. In addition, there are amending regulations, which are a response to particular points that have been made during consultation. I must emphasise that the principles of the scheme, as I said in answer to the hon. Member for Cathcart, were communicated to local authorities as long ago as last July. Operational details have not changed since. Therefore, in response to the hon. Gentleman's reasonable question, I can say that the Government are confident that authorities should be able to include transitional relief calculations in initial council tax bills. The first bills, which shall be sent out next month, should contain correct calculations made on the basis of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that most councils would send out bills based on most households being two-person households, and that single people could claim a discount. If so, how can transitional relief be operated? Every household is provided for as a two-person household, but transitional relief is to be based on a discounted amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will accept that councils have to act on information available to them. If they do not think that a household is eligible for a discount, they will not think that there should be a discount in relation to the relief scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are obliged to make reasonable assumptions about discounts. In practice, most have canvassed to calculate discounts correctly. No problem should arise from the matters mentioned by the hon. Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Cathcart to discuss local government finance in Scotland. It was in this Room that he and I debated the Committee stage of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Bill, which led to the poll tax. In those days, the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) had not left Edinburgh, South, which he used to represent, and the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Malone) had not departed Aberdeen, South. Indeed, at that time there were a lot more Conservatives in the House representing Scottish constituencies, which is not unconnected with the imposition of the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a transitional relief scheme. I am acutely conscious that in my office there is still correspondence about the difficulties arising from the poll tax transitional relief scheme, which caused many problems. We are now devising yet another such scheme, which I fear will lead to further difficulties. I accept that the Minister is offering help to households that will be particularly hard hit by the imposition of the new tax. That help is welcome—as far as it goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new tax will not be a bed of roses, even if we compare it with the poll tax or the rates. The Minister said that the valuation bands had been professionally calculated by independent valuers, but identical houses in the same street in our constituencies have been put into different tax bands. That problem has inevitably raised questions, and it will have to be resolved sooner or later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain concerned about the way in which the new tax will operate. I have no doubt that because it has been rushed in to respond to a political crisis—just as the previous tax was—it will present difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the many letters that I have received recently about local government taxation, I should like to ask the Minister about a specific instance in which transitional help may be required. The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I am referring to timeshare properties. I have received 20 or 30 letters from constituents who own timeshare properties, or shares in properties elsewhere in Scotland, and I suspect that all right hon. and hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies will have received similar representations. In the past, people have paid the standard poll tax on dwelling houses in which they own a share. However, such dwellings will now be treated as commercial property and subject to commercial rating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know at what level that decision has been taken, but a number of people believe that there has been rough justice. It would be helpful if the Minister could briefly explain the Government's attitude to such properties. Transferring them from one category of local taxation to another will impose a significant extra burden on some people. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us why, if only to help us reply to correspondence from constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great privilege to be summoned to serve on a Committee to debate Scottish business—almost as great a privilege as having two Budgets in the same year. In case I find it all too emotional, I thought that it I spoke now I might be spared any subsequent experience.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I should like to share with my hon. Friend the Minister the very general proposition that, ultimately, local government will carry out the functions that can be financed by its own source of revenue. That may not be an immediate objective, but I believe that sooner or later the tension that is created between central and local government by a mismatch of responsibilities and revenue will be removed by giving local authorities those functions which can be financed by local revenue. Because the determination of local revenue is not an easy exercise for Parliament—as we have learnt over the past three or four years—I hope that, in the council tax, we have established something that will stand well into the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one narrow point for my hon. Friend the Minister. It is extremely important that the council tax is seen as enforceable. Otherwise, it will be unable to perform the wider role which I think that it will possess in the future. Transitional arrangements test the complexities of any scheme, so this is an opportune moment for an early sighting of the enforceability of the council tax. In relation to Scotland—which is a guide for other parts of the United Kingdom—how did my hon. Friend the Minister deem the enforceability of the old ratings system and the community charge? How does he see the enforceability of the council tax under the regulations, which cover the transitional arragements? I hope that the post-transitional level of enforceability will be even higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the burden of my few comments. It is a privilege to speak on Scottish matters, especially as I come from the Welsh border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.59 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to hear the criticism, albeit coded, of the poll tax that was inherent in the comments of the right hon. Member for Shropshire, North (Mr. Biffen). He was a member of the Cabinet when the poll tax was introduced and was leader of the House when the Abolition of Domestic Rates (Scotland) Bill was guillotined. The right hon. Gentleman bears some responsibility for the mess into which the poll tax led the country and his party in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not share the welcome of my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian for the transitional arrangements. The vast majority of those who will benefit from the transitional relief scheme will be the better off who have done extremely well over the past few years under the poll tax when compared with the old rating system and now the council tax. For four years, those who live in the biggest houses in Scotland have done very well and have not paid their fair share of taxes to local authorities. The burden has been placed on the less well off who are just outside any rebate scheme. The new scheme will benefit those in larger houses whose poll tax was low and who will pay more under the council tax. The scheme will not benefit my constituents who live in council houses, semi-detached houses or four-in-a-block private housing. It will benefit those who five in big houses in Newlands. Those who will pay a lot more in council tax than they paid in poll tax will benefit from the scheme and I have reservations about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council tax was designed to ensure that the better off do not pay their fair share of local taxation and that those who live in the highest value properties pay only three times more than those in the lowest band. Under the old rating system, each property was valued individually and if a property was worth £2 million, rates were paid accordingly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
but the council tax on such a property would be only three times more than the council tax on a council house in the same local government area. That has always been one of my objections to the council tax: it does not remove the inequalities that the poll tax created. The Government are now giving extra money to those who benefited by introducing the transitional relief scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate Jack Wood and other valuers in Scotland on the work that they have been forced to do in a great hurry and local authority finance departments on their work in setting up the scheme. They should never have been asked to do that. There was a simpler way of getting rid of the poll tax—to return to the old valuation rolls that were in force prior to introduction of the poll tax and which could have been updated. If the Government had then wanted to make amendments, they could have done so over a longer period, thereby giving local authorities and valuers more time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose to reform local government and it would have been sensible for them to do so hand in hand with reform of local government finance. They should have returned to the rating system. They will fail to consider the tax base, to which the right hon. Member for Shropshire, North referred, of each local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is determined to keep his tiny and worthless local authority of Eastwood outside Glasgow. Anybody with sense would recognise that the tax base for a single-tier authority must include all those who use the services of the authority. Therefore, a single-tier Greater Glasgow authority should include the much larger tax bases of Eastwood, Bearsden, Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, which are commuter areas of Glasgow. They use Glasgow's services and should pay for them. The poorer people of Glasgow should have properly-financed services, as suggested by the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Clarke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for coming in and out of the Committee, but I was checking my facts. I was a county councillor before I became a regional councillor and I remember the organisations and the small parasitical groups around the cities, although Midlothian did not fall into that category. It is right that very rich small boroughs should be part and parcel of the city of Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about consultation. I have not received much correspondence, except on one matter. That worries me because I think that Members of Parliament will be inundated in the near future when the facts begin to hit the public. I hope that the consultation process has not finished. Many of those who will be affected by the measure and who will come to Members of Parliament and councillors for help will be older people, less mobile people and people, such as single parents, who work almost all the hours that God gives them to try to make ends meet. Members of Parliament will be swamped by this problem. I hope that local government, whose staffing is being examined, will not be swamped. Relief must be provided for the burden that it will have to take on when people start banging in appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exception to which I referred, and which I believe my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) mentioned in my absence, is timeshare properties. I have received many letters on the subject. There have been six this week, all saying more or less the same thing. Timeshare properties have been categorised as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
commercial properties. As the letters make clear, it is not appreciated that timeshare properties for holidays are different from hotels and properties of that ilk. I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government will take cognisance of that and reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although timeshares have had adverse publicity abroad, they are quite successful, particularly in parts of Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relate his remarks to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the proposed change in taxation will not adversely affect those projects. To put them on a commercial basis might make people shy off or stop such activity or sell or close the property. That would have an impact on rural areas and a knock-on effect in recreation and other activities connected with timeshares. It would also have a detrimental effect on the income of communities scattered throughout some of the most beautiful parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Secretary of State to consider this matter in detail. The problem will affect not just individuals but communities and a host of industries, especially the tourist industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.10 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond, first, to the right and proper point that was made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Shropshire, North? It is always a pleasure to hear him speak in Committee or on the floor of the House. He asked about enforceability. What he said about the importance of matching responsibilites with revenue was right. I have always believed that it is clear that if there was not a base of taxation that local government could raise locally, inevitably, in time, central Government would take over all the functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my right hon. Friend that we believe that the council tax will stand well into the future. It will be readily enforceable for several reasons: there will be fewer bills to chase than under the community charge; there will be 100 per cent. benefits, which means that there will be fewer small bills; and the basic liability is with property, as under the rating system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister would extend that aspect to a tax base relating to the services provided. Glasgow provides the facilities for the Burrell collection in Kelvingrove and halls and sports arenas, which the Minister's constituents in Eastwood use. Does he believe that, under the new system, Eastwood should pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That enables me to answer the hon. Gentleman's earlier point on that matter. I assure him that his remarks on Eastwood, Bearsden, Milngavie and, perhaps above all, Bishopbriggs will gain wide publicity. I recall the recent comments by the Labour provost of Strathkelvin, who specifically denounced the ambitions of the city of Glasgow to take over the ancient borough of Bishopbriggs. He gained considerable and excellent publicity in that admirable newspaper the Glasgow 
	<i>Evening Times.</i> I assure the hon. Gentleman that it will not just be the Eastwood Labour party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Eastwood Conservatives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, they are already convinced. We shall ensure that the Eastwood Labour party receives sufficient copies of the hon. Member for Cathcart's remarks on that matter. Before he diverts me away for the order, I shall turn to the comments of the hon. Member for East Lothian who welcomed the scheme in itself but said that he and the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Clarke) were concerned about timeshares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I shall write to the Opposition Members on that point, but I understand that there is a prayer on the Order Paper in relation to timeshares. I should be happy to respond now on that matter but, if there is to be a separate debate on timeshares, it would be more appropriate for me then to respond to hon. Members' concerns on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart commented broadly on the community charge system. It would be inappropriate for me to recall the history of local government reform in Scotland in this forum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although my point was very general, I shall make it more specific to the regulations by asking the Minister to tell us what calculations he has used to determine which bands of properties the transitional relief is most likely to go to. That information is important for us to decide whether we support the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the details for the simple reason that transitional relief will depend on the tax levels set by each authority which will put people either above or below the threshold. The resason for transitional relief is simple: it will minimise, beyond a particular point, the burden to individual households which will have occurred as a consequence of the change from the community charge to the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must challenge the Minister's suggestion that this will be simple. The formula in the regulations is, 
	<div class='img'></div> <!-- img --> C being the product of (AXN)—R. That is anything but simple. Will the Minister take the opportunity to explain what all this means? We know very well that the previous transitional relief gave rise to massive anomalies and I fear that the same thing will happen with this scheme. The Minister said that I welcomed the scheme; I accept the need for it, but I am not happy about the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to explain the simple formula that is set out on page 3 of the regulations. The basic formula is stated in regulation 5(1)(b) as being 
	<div class='img'></div> <!-- img --> T is the scheme tax multiplied by the discount. Therefore, that is the discounted tax. Subtracted from that is what everyone must pay, which is C + S — the community tax plus the threshold—with S being the threshold and C being the tax. It is divided by 365 because there are 365 days in a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about a leap year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's question is relevant to the year after next. We shall introduce another regulation if the transitional scheme applies to that year. The regulations relate solely to the forthcoming financial year. I am sure that Opposition Members will welcome them on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister seriously telling us that he has not calculated who will benefit from the scheme? I find that quite incredible. I asked a simple question about which bands would benefit from the transitional relief. In my opinion, it will be those at the top of the valuation. The bottom end is, presumably, based on comparing what two people in a property pay in council tax with what they paid in poll tax. There must be a top end and the scheme will benefit the rich. If the Minister can prove to me that it will not, I shall accept that this is quite a good scheme. However, I do not believe that to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, of course, we have calculated the total consequences of the scheme. Secondly, we cannot give precise figures for each band until we know the tax rates. Thirdly, if the hon. Gentleman is making the broad generalisation that households at the top end will gain by having their bills damped down, that is correct. However, the threshold is not regressive and increases higher up the scale. That is the progressive element of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.20 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer to two or three of my earlier points which have been further exposed by my hon. Friends. Perhaps the Minister will provide a breakdown of the £25 million of transitional relief, which should inform us which bands will benefit. We have no doubt that bands A, B and C will not benefit and that bands E, F, G and H will receive the bulk of that £25 million. It may be impossible for the Minister to provide the information today, but I hope that detailed information will be sent to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second crucial point concerns expenditure. The Minister is aware that no provision for transitional relief for next year has been identified in the expenditure White Paper, "Serving Scotland's needs". Next year, the Government intend to lump the community charge transitional relief, the community adoption scheme and the council tax transitional relief with the revenue grant, non-domestic rates and transitional relief. The itemised amount will disappear. Does that mean that transitional relief will be for only one year, or should we assume that local government will have to bear the cost as part of the overall revenue support grant settlement for the year 1994–95?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absurdity of the poll tax is shown in the fact that £140 million was given to Scotland in 1991–92 for the community charge reduction scheme, £107 million in 1992–93 and that will continue in 1993–94 with £17 million. The Committee wants to know where the impact will be felt and an assurance on whether money will be included in the budget in forthcoming years or, better still, that there will be no transitional relief after this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends made the crucial point that the Government seem to be incapable, by instinct or ideology, of providing any form of local government finance which is not bogged down in political expediency. It cannot be right for a system of local government finance to discriminate in favour of those who least need help. A fair system would not be bogged down with transitional relief. That was provided for the poll tax just before a general election to cushion the impact of progressively higher bills. We demand answers to our questions and I make a plea to the Minister that in any future discussion on local government the Government should forget those who are well off and whom the Government constantly protect and provide
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
instead a system which is fair, collectable and accountable. That requires reconsideration of the Government's half-baked proposals on local government reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is incredible that we have estimates from the Government on the total cost of transitional relief but no information on the bits and pieces that make up the calculations. If relief is to be given at the top end, regulations could have been introduced with a cut-off point so that those at the top end, who could afford to pay higher amounts and who benefited considerably under the poll tax system, would not be given transitional relief. Transitional relief for those at the lower ends of the bands could still be contained in the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are eight bands that have only a threefold distinction and that relates to some of the discussions that we had about the poll tax. The famous Mates amendment suggested that those not paying income tax should pay only half of the poll tax; those on higher rates should pay one and half times the poll tax; and the difference should be threefold. This system comes from the same stable as those provisions. The bands could only be justified if there were more of them, if they went up to higher rates and if there were a bigger distinction between the amounts paid by those in the higher band and those in the lower band. In those circumstances, with a cut-off point, it might be appropriate to have a transitional relief programme, but that is not the scheme before us today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.26 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will respond to the point about where the money will come from in the following years. Will it come out of the general support given to local authorities? In other words, will local authorities be asked to give £25 million of their general expenditure as a straight handout to the better-off at the expense of the poorer in our society? If that is what the Government are suggesting, it is an absolute disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes); I was waiting for the hon. Member for Cathcart to finish his contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East asked about the cut-off point. If he examines how the transitional scheme will work, he will discover that the threshold rises as the scale increases. The hon. Member for Fife, Central, reasonably suggested that not all the details on who will benefit will be available because announcements about the council tax have only just been made. We have some information available on the details and I assure the hon. Gentleman that when we have the full figures I shall write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point, which has been put to me by the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Cathcart, is who will pay for the transitional relief scheme. I assure the Committee that there will be extra resources from the Treasury; relief will not be taken from what would otherwise be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central reasonably asked about the itemisation of expenditure in future years. I assure him that next year's provision will be itemised as he suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I see that prayers have been tabled by the hon. Members for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan). It has occurred to me that that Prayer may not come before a Committee, which could make it difficult for us to address the problem of transitional relief as it should relate to people involved in timeshare property. This might be the only opportunity to discuss that matter. Could the Minister explain the Government's attitude? I do not necessarily have a strong view on one side or the other of the argument. However, the matter concerns a considerable number of our constituents. It would be useful if the Minister could let us know whether the Government are prepared to reconsider it in the light of these representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Comments of that nature must relate specifically to the transitional relief scheme. The regulations cover that scheme. They do not cover timeshare, apart from in the context of the transitional relief scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Mills. I am happy to meet the hon. Gentleman to discuss his concerns about timeshare.

	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises a specific point. Timeshare could be classified as a second home, for which the council tax, which is based on the valuation, could be higher than under the poll tax. I accept that that might not be so, because the Government are giving a SO per cent. discount to second-home owners. Presumably that discount is taken into account before any transitional relief is given. I do not know how timeshare properties are valued. Is the valuation based on 52 times the amount of money that is invested in the property. That may amount to £150,000, or is it the saleable value of the property, which may amount to £30,000? If such a property were classified as a second home for transitional relief rather than as a commercial property, which valuation would the local authority put on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
