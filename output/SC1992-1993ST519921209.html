	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is convenient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992, No. 2595).—
	<i>[Mr. Burt.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for agreeing to debate the two instruments separately. I do not think that the Committee will be long detained on the first, although there may be considerable discussion and debate on the second.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The instrument makes a series of amendments to the regulations, but I want to concentrate on paragraph 6, which deals with the revocation of regulation 49. Much concern has already been expressed about that revocation. I refer the Minister to an early-day motion tabled on 10 November, which expressed great anxiety about the Government's proposals. To date, 165 hon. Members have supported that early-day motion, which clearly demonstrates the widespread anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure deals with late claims for supplementary benefit. Because that was abolished a while ago, it may be thought that there is no great need to keep the measure on the statute book. There are major anxieties about such an attitude. I am grateful to the various pressure groups and lobby groups that have advised us on the difficulties that may be experienced by the most vulnerable people if the Government proceed with revocation of the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 49 maintained the possibility of a late claim for supplementary benefit, even though the supplementary benefit scheme had been replaced by the income support system. However, in order to be able to make a late claim for supplementary benefit a person still had to prove that he or she had good cause for not having made a claim previously. There was, therefore, no automatic right to supplementary benefit if a late claim was made. It is important to stress that we are not discussing whether a claimant would be entitled to supplementary benefit if a late claim were made. It would be considered in the usual way, but the claimant would have to prove that there was a good cause for not having made a claim at the correct time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Ignorance of entitlement was not good enough to establish good cause. A person had to show that he or she had difficulties or disabilities that made it reasonable for him or her not to make inquiries, or that he or she had been misled by wrong advice or information. The entitlement would be assessed and the claimant would then have to show good cause for not making the claim at the right time. Having shown good cause, the claimant may then be entitled to the benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation is especially relevant to people with disabilities and perhaps particularly to those with a mental handicap. Many groups have said that they are worried that those vulnerable groups would be discriminated against yet again by the revocation of regulation 49, especially people with educational difficulties, who may not have been in a position at the time of their entitlement to make a correct claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government want to bring forward the revocation because when the regulation was introduced, it was intended to be temporary, but it is difficult to understand why that is justified. If people fail to recognise their proper entitlement, perhaps because of incorrect advice or because their circumstances do not allow them to inquire about it why should they be prevented from claiming it when they become aware of their right to it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was the provision brought forward so quickly without due consultation and without advertising that it would be withdrawn, thereby denying the opportunity for a trawl of people who may be entitled to benefit to ensure that they made their claims before the regulation was withdrawn? The Minister will confirm that the Government's right to reclaim overpaid benefit or benefit paid to people who were not entitled to it will remain on the statute book. The right for people to claim is being withdrawn, but the Government's right to take money back will remain. That is not even-handed. As the Child Poverty Action Group said, what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important to remember that if someone establishes good cause for the delay in claiming and is awarded supplementary benefit, that person could be entitled to more transitional protection, which may increase the amount of income support to which he will become entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the early-day motion makes clear, the provision affects those on the lowest incomes and those who ae most vulnerable in society. We should take all measures at all times to ensure that when they have established a right to benefit, even if that is supplementary benefit, they should not be disadvantaged and lose the right to that entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not oppose all changes in the regulations, some of which are sensible, but I urge the Under-Secretary to reconsider regulation 49 and to leave it on the statute book was to ensure that no-one is denied the right to benefit if that right has been clearly established and good cause has been shown for not claiming it at the relevant time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I generally support what the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) said about regulation 49. I do not understand why we go in for these miscellaneous provisions and regulations. Piecemeal reforms, brought in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
month in, month out, are a nightmare for people, trying to find their way through the various regulations on claims and payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am only a Scottish solicitor, not a superior city-slicker with a large silk hanky, so perhaps I find it particularly difficult to pick my way through the regulations. I pay tribute to the work of welfare rights workers, the CPAG and other groups. As we heard in the speech of the hon. Member for Withington, they have given much advice, but they are finding it increasingly difficult to deal with the amended and amended-yet-again regulations. Will the Department ca' canny when it introduces the miscellaneous provision changes in the statutory instrument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the statutory instrument is entitled "Terms and Conditions of Employment" because that title does not seem to bear any relation to the text of the miscellaneous provisions changes. That is another aspect of the whole system that is difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I welcome the prospect of a debate this morning, we have to bear in mind that we are dealing with regulations that were implemented on 16 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to regulation 32 in paragraph 4 refers to a change that will make it possible for information to be given. It inserts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(unless the Secretary of State determines in any particular case to accept notice given otherwise than in writing)".</p></blockquote>
I welcome that change, but I should like to know what communication "otherwise than in writing" means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to regulation 34 in paragraph 5 inserts "natural" between "another" and "person". Does "another natural person" mean that there could be an unnatural person? The reasons for that change are not obvious to me and I would appreciate it if the Minister could explain them to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment to Schedule 9, in paragraph 8, changes the definition of "water charges". From my own constituency experience. I know that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Chapter I of Part V of the Water Industry Act 1991(a)"</p></blockquote>
does not apply to Scotland. Our water industry has yet to be privatised, although that is only a matter of time. I have not had a chance to check, but I assume that, if those changes are significant, Scotland will not be left out or prejudiced in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the plea made by the hon. Member for Withington about regulation 49. He made his case succinctly and elegantly and two of his points made a particular impression on me. First, the lack of notice for changes such as those in paragraph 8 is unconscionable. We are not talking about large amounts of money. Can the Minister tell the Committee how much money will be saved as a result of the change? He has obviously done a lot of homework and arithmetic and at least will be able to give us ball park figures of the savings. The Social Security Act 1986 moved away from the supplementary benefit system and it may be that, in time, the Government will want to draw a line under the previous provisions. They could not do that fairly without months of notice so that the welfare rights organisations and the pressure groups could publicise it and the specialist pressure groups, such as those dealing with learning difficulties, could have a last drive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about entitlements being withdrawn without hindrance. It is unfair for the Department to do that at such short notice. Why are the Government in such a hurry? It would not have cost anything to leave it for
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
another three months and that would have given all those concerned a chance to respond as positively as possible to the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation does nothing other than to make changes that will deny people their rights and entitlements. It will affect those claims which, had they been made in due time, would have received back-dated benefit. Even if only a handful of cases are excluded by the regulation, the claimants could lose quite substantial sums of money. Changes such as this should not be made in a casual way. It appears 
	<i>prima facie,</i> that the Government and the Department have made that change in a slightly casual way. I hope that that does not sound over-critical of the Minister and that he will address my comments. I do not think that we are talking about much money and I do not know what it would cost the Government to let the present system run for some time yet before introducing this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.46 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the regulations and I am also grateful for the contributions of Opposition Members. I shall cover the points made by hon. Gentlemen, but first I shall answer the question about why we have introduced the regulation. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) will know that we constantly watch the social security system. From time to time anomalies appear and we try to correct them. It is not a question of doing things piecemeal, but of responding to need and putting matters before the House to tidy up regulations. It is a constant process that all Departments go through. There is a need, and a reason, for each of the provisions and I shall highlight some of them. We have thought about these changes—they have not been made casually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Withington. The provision that revokes regulation 49 of the claims and payments regulations has attracted considerable attention, which is exemplified by the early-day motion of 10 November tabled by the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) and some of his colleagues. The level of concern is out of all proportion to the effects of the revocation. The terms of the early-day motion highlighted a fundamental misconception about the regulations. I should like to emphasise that there is no question of people losing benefit through official error as a result of the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 49 was a transitional provision to enable claims to supplementary benefit and family income supplement to be dealt with after those benefits were abolished in 1988. It is true that its revocation now would preclude any new claims for supplementary benefit for periods before April 1988. However, it does not make sense for people to be able to claim benefit intended for current needs four and a half years after its abolition, particularly when claims for its successor, income support, cannot be backdated more than 12 months. When income support was introduced, it was right to provide some leeway for late claims to supplementary benefit. All those who might have claimed have had ample opportunity to do so and the continued existence of regulation 49 is genuinely anomalous and unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, cases may come to light in which the failure to claim supplementary benefit was the result of departmental error, for example, where an official gave inaccurate or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
misleading information. That is the central point conveyed by the early-day motion and the main point of many who have been worried about the regulation. However, there are well-established procedures for dealing with such cases and for making ex-gratia payments where appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that that is not the same as a statutory remedy, but it is important to recognise the difficulty of dealing with claims that are long overdue, the facts of which are difficult to establish accurately. The Social Security Advisory Committee carried out a thorough study of the whole subject of time limits in the 1980s. Its firm conclusion was that the interests of good administration and fairness to all claimants required absolute time limits and that it was right to deal with cases of official error outside those time limits extra-statutorily. I should add that that has always been the position for the majority of benefits. In having no absolute time limit, supplementary benefit was an exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also emphasise that the fact that people can no longer make late claims for supplementary benefit will not affect the position of people who claimed supplementary benefit on time, but who did not receive their correct entitlement. The regulations covering review of incorrect adjudication decisions already apply to supplementary benefit and will continue to do so. They provide for unlimited arrears in cases of official error. The Opposition's fears that the revocation of regulation 49 will prevent the correction of official errors are, therefore, wholly unfounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington expressed concern about mentally handicapped claimants who may not have taken up their entitlement to supplementary benefit. I can only repeat that supplementary benefit, like income support, was intended to meet current, day-to-day needs. It is reasonable to treat mentally handicapped claimants in the same way whether their entitlement arose before or after 1988. However, it is highly unlikely that there are many, if any, cases of severe need, in which entitlement existed before 1988, but which have not been taken up four and a half years later. If any case of official misdirection comes to light, it will be covered. Therefore, such fears are unfounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the regulations have been sprung upon an unsuspecting world. That is not the case. The proposals have been in the public domain since August and the Social Security Advisory Committee was content that the regulations need not be referred for formal consultation. That suggests that the Social Security Advisory Committee appreciated that no sinister motive lay behind the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington raised the sauce for goose and gander argument; that there is no time limit on overpayment recovery. It would be illogical to place a time limit on the recovery of overpayment. That would advantage those who could conceal fraud the longest, and would be wrong. In addition, overpayments are recovered only in cases of claimant error. Underpayments are made good in full in cases of official error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire raised three other points, the first of which related to regulation 4. The Benefits Agency wants to deliver a more efficient and responsive service and hopes to deal with more transactions by telephone. That will include the notification of minor changes in circumstances. Therefore, the amendment enables the Secretary of State to accept such notification.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Where necessary, the claimant will be asked to supply written confirmation of the change later. The new procedures will be piloted first to test their effectiveness, but the intention is to reduce bureaucracy when it is sensible to do so. In effect, a person who wishes to notify the Benefits Agency of a change of circumstances can do so by telephone rather than having the hassle of writing it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point related to the natural or unnatural person. The regulation would enable benefit to be paid to a relative or close friend of the claimant in cases where the claimant would misuse the benefit because of some sort of incapacity, such as gambling the money away, being affected by alcohol or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would prevent payments being directed to a corporate body, such as a public utility or a housing authority, under that regulation. While regulation 35 provides for direct payment of income support to meet debts to corporate bodies, some creditors are thought to invoke regulation 34 to obtain direct payment of contributory benefits for housing or fuel costs. That was never the intention of the policy and the amendment would restore the original policy intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire made a point about the reference to Scotland. Regulation 8 makes some technical changes to the criteria for direct payment of water charges in England and Wales. Water charges in Scotland are levied as supplement to the community charge and are subject to the usual payment enforcement procedures, which might involve deductions from income support after a local authority has obtained a summary warrant. Those changes apply only to England and Wales because different arrangements apply in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee feels that I have answered some of the questions raised. The revocation of regulation 49 is long overdue. It serves no useful purpose and its continuing existence has lead to some strange abuses. Some welfare rights organisations have argued that its continued existence means that the supplementary benefits scheme is still current in all its manifestations. I am pleased to say that a social security commissioner has already disagreed with such a wide interpretation. Revoking the regulations will remove the opportunity for any future manipulation that wastes valuable staff time, which could be more usefully deployed elsewhere in the Benefits Agency dealing with need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my remarks satisfy the Committee and that it agrees the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.56 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his detailed explanation of the regulations. He said that the Government's real wish in revoking regualtion 49 was to expunge all memory of the supplementary benefits system. He wanted us to believe that the changes that were made in the 1988 Act somehow moved the social security provision forward and were to the benefit of claimants. The Government probably want to forget the days when people had far more right, entitlements and welfare provisions. In the context of expunging supplementary benefits, single payments spring to mind immediately—one more provision the Government may wish to expunge from memory as the social fund causes even deeper resentment among claimants. I now clearly understand why the regulation must be revoked.

I want to comment on the statement that the regulations were widely publicised. I am always suspicious when statutory instruments are placed in the public domain in August. We all recognise that on many occasions the Government wish to promote their legislation at a time when there is least public scrutiny and least public awareness of what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am suspicious when the Government introduce changes at a time of least public scrutiny, but I am happy that the Minister recognised the value of the Social Security Advisory Committee. When we come to the second regulation, we may discuss further his defence of not needing wider consultation or a proper debate before the regulations come into effect in November. The Social Security Advisory Committee is an important body, whose views should be taken into account. I rest my comments on that point—but may, perhaps, revive them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the Minister says about there still being an opportunity for claims to be made where there is clear evidence of official error. We accept that there are few cases—which is why we feel that it is unnecessary to revoke the regulation—in which there are clear arguments about what is an official error. How is an official error defined and how much is based on misinformation? It is difficult, many years later, to find the necessary evidence.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. As a relative newcomer, I should be grateful for your guidance on dealing with this second instrument. There was a debate on this measure in the other place on 1 December. I can summarise it by saying that a motion was moved that the measure should not be proceeded with. The other place called upon the Government to take account of further evidence on the effect of the proposed changes and to reconsider the desirability of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of that worthwhile debate, to which I am sure hon. Members will refer, the Minister said that the Government would not oppose the motion. The Countess of Mar, who moved the resolution, said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Minister had summed up in the other place, the motion was agreed to. Although I accept that proceedings in the House of Commons are not governed by those in the other place, there was a clear, all-party consensus there that the measure should not be proceeded with. The Government ignore the strong feelings expressed in the other place and show a certain contempt for its deliberations by bringing forward the measure this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made representations to the Secretary of State, but he rejected our request not to proceed with the statutory instrument. For the Government to ignore, meaningful deliberations in both Houses on important matters and to plough ahead, especially as the regulations have already been implemented, shows a lack of understanding of the true process of parliamentary democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the circumstances relating to the statutory instrument as discussed in the other place. The hon. Gentleman has made a good job, in his usual gentlemanly manner, of expressing constitutional outrage. I think that he knows that the circumstances are slightly different from those that he has suggested to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In replying to the debate in the other place, the Minister made it clear that the regulations would be proceeded with. I shall quote what my noble Friend said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As regards the second part of the Motion, we intend to go forward with the regulations on 3rd December. On the basis of the evidence before us now, we are satisfied with the desirability of those regulations."—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 1 December 1992; vol. 540, c. 1332.]</p></blockquote>
The Government did not oppose the motion, which asked for further consideration to be given to the regulations. We maintained then, as I maintain today, that we shall monitor the regulations carefully to ensure that they do not have the effect that the other place feared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington referred to a letter from the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar)—the shadow Secretary of State—to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, which seemed to translate what the Minister in the other place had said to mean quite the opposite, namely, that the Government would not go ahead. Having read precisely what my noble Friend said, it is a mystery how the hon. Member for Garscadden made that construction. Perhaps the mystery of how he did that is clearer to the hon. Member for Withington than it is to me. The Government's intention to proceed with the regulations and to monitor them was made clear before we decided to accept the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.6 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue the matter. The Minister is partial in his view of how the other place works. He is correct that his noble friend said that the Government would proceed with the regulations, but the motion stated that although there should be a review, the regulations should not be proceeded with. That motion was accepted, although the Minister had made it clear that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Government intended to proceed with the regulations. The Government seem to be telling the other place they supported the motion but will do what they wish. That shows contempt for motions moved in the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is amazing that we are even discussing these important regulations this morning. All the advice, evidence and views of wide-ranging groups of people, from church leaders to pressure groups and the general public, is that no one can understand why the Government wish to proceed. In our previous deliberations, the Minister refferred to the advice that was given to the Government by their own Social Security Advisory Committee. He said that we should proceed with the regulations because the advisory committee had considered them, and had said that there was no fundamental objection to them and that they should go forward. Nothing could could be further from the truth. The recommendation of the Social Security Advisory Committee stated clearly that the regulations should not be proceeded with. Members in the other place were staggered that the Government could fly in the face of the overwhelming advice of their own Social Security Advisory Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are the Government's attempt to deal with a specific and discrete problem—new age travellers. No one will argue that there is no problem with new age travellers and that action is needed. However, it is clear from the evidence that the Government are handling the problem in the wrong way. The matter should not be dealt with through social security legislation. It is more a matter of public order and of law and order than of manipulating regulations on social security. There is a widespread belief and strong evidence that the Government's target will not be hit, but that other vulnerable groups will be hurt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overwhelming view is that there are other ways of dealing with the problem. Regulations already exist which, if properly administered, would more clearly identify the problem. If the Government were serious in their attempt to deal with new age travellers, they would withdraw the regulations, return to the drawing board, reconsider what they want to do and how they want to achieve that, and obtain all-party support for a more sensible route that does not attack other people. The regulations cover hardship payments under income support. Those payments are only 60 per cent. of the income support rate—that is, £25 a week for a single person. The Government are introducing new regulations to deny hardship benefit to a group of people who are probably much more able to circumvent the regulations than many other groups who may suffer the real hardship, not only of not receiving the payment, but losing the right to other benefits to which income support is a passport—for example, housing benefit, poll tax benefit and, in future, council tax benefit. The Government must be very clear about the real issues and what will happen as a consequence of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider the administrative changes in terms of warning people about whether they are actively seeking work. Under the current arrangements, warning letters are sent to people stating clearly what they must do to ensure that they do not lose entitlement because of lack of proof that they are actively seeking work. The warning letters which have been sent out since the changes were made have been very successful. After having the procedures clearly explained and being given the opportunity to provide evidence that they were actively seeking work, the number
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
of people who were denied benefit was very small. It was also noticeable how many people subsequently claimed hardship allowance. People were able to satisfy the employment service that they were actively seeking work and were therefore, entitled to benefit, but very few eventually received hardship allowances. We must question whether people really knew of their entitlement to such hardship payments once they satisfied the adjudication officer that they had actively sought work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look carefully at the administrative changes. Vulnerable groups of people not having received the warning letter, will be immediately denied benefit. We should consider those with literacy problems, health problems or those who are so worn down by the system that they find it very difficult to furnish proof of actively seeking work. That failure will prove them guilty before they can prove their innocence. People will be denied benefit at the very time when they are in greatest need of some payment. The sums of money are small but the claimants will be caught by the administrative changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much research is being done into the effect of long-term unemployment and the way in which this has undermined people's confidence and their ability to claim their just entitlements. In the debate in the House yesterday, the shadow Secretary of State for Employment made telling points about the effects of unemployment. He said that in the current situation,
	<br><blockquote><p>"More than 30 unemployed people were chasing every job vacancy, with no fewer than 70 people chasing every job vacancy in London. Almost 1 million people had been out of work for more than a year."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1992; Vol.215, c.699]</p></blockquote>
On the advice of the Social Security Advisory Committee, the availability-for-work rules have been relaxed. It is believed that the opportunities for employment are so limited, with unemployment rising, that to make the test more draconian is quite out of proportion to the problem that the Government are addressing. The Minister should look much more carefully at the advice of his own advisory committee on the way in which the rules will operate at a time of recession and high unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes also contradict the advice that was given in the Social Security Act 1989 when the availability to work rule was first introduced. I quote from the original note given to hon. Members at that time which stated that a claimant
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be given a clear warning and will thus be specifically reminded of what constituted actively seeking work and will have been given an opportunity to take appropriate action, before the question of whether he fails to satisfy the test arises to put to the adjudication officer."</p></blockquote>
At that time, the Minister stressed,
	<br><blockquote><p>"we do not want benefits to be withdrawn, but we want to encourage people to take steps to get back into employment."</p></blockquote>
The changes relating to the withdrawal of the warning letters mean that a person will lose benefit and will have no right of appeal against the decision until the adjudication officer has considerd the case. There will be a clear penalty against someone who may subsequently be able to prove that they were actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue that immediately springs to mind is that because of the number of people seeking every job vacancy, many employers are not prepared, administratively, to furnish information to applicants to prove that they sought a job with that company. It is difficult for people to receive written notification that they applied for a job and were not successful, because it does not make economic sense for a company to reply to each applicant when so many people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
are chasing every job. At a time of lengthening dole queues, the Government are making it harder for the long-term unemployed to satisfy the actively seeking work rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have a fundamental flaw. To be eligible for hardship payments the claimant has to satisfy tests under either regulations 10A(ii) or 8(iii), which concern availability for work. If a person is found to be available for but not actively seeking work, that person is not entitled to hardship payments. However, if a person satisfies neither the availability-for-work rule nor the actively seeking work rule, he may be entitled to hardship payment. That might mean that the people who are meant to be attacked by these regulations will, because of their lifestyle, street-wiseness and other factors, be able to claim hardship payments. However, other more vunerable, people will not be entitled to claim benefit because they will satisfy the availability-to-work rule but not the actively seeking work rule. Significant numbers of people may fall into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That problem was recognised by the Social Security Advisory Committee, which was particularly concerned about women who may be fleeing from domestic violence or other abuse. The difficulty of those women was highlighted in the excellent debate in the other place. There is concern that such women, who may be in refuges, may be considered to be available for work. Because of their particular circumstances however, they cannot go out to find work. I am sure that the Minister understands their predicament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have highlighted the special circumstances of women fleeing from violence, but homeless people, people with literacy problems, people with disabilities that are not so severe that they are entitled to benefits which would give them a passport to a decent level of income, also have special circumstances. Such groups may be deemed to be available for work but, in practice, because of their special circumstances, are not actively looking for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many disabled people already feel too disadvantaged in the workplace to look for work actively at a time of high unemployment, when employers have the pick of potential applicants. That means that they may be available for work but that actively seeking work does nothing for their self-esteem nor does it get them off the unemployment register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister in the other place briefly dealt with such concerns when he said that such groups of people, particularly women in refuges, would not be considered to be available for work. I would like the Minister to go into much more detail about not just how that vulnerable group will be affected but how a range of others will be affected because of their particular circumstances at a particular time. He should tell us whether they will be deemed to be available for work and whether they will be entitled to hardship payments if they are not looking for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations would have an effect in several ways. They would change the administration in the benefit office. They would deny people benefit because those people would be deemed guilty unless they could prove their innocence. When the measures were introduced, a crucial part of the availability-to-work regulations was the need to give information to claimants about their rights and their duties in order to satisfy the adjudication officer that they were actively seeking work. Withdrawal of and changes to those procedures would hit many people who would otherwise be entitled to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The conflict in the regulations between availability to work and actively seeking work has not been properly thought through. The regulations would not hit the Government's target. We have to question whether changing benefit regulations is the right way to deal with the problem of new age travellers. The Government are taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. There are already procedures and opportunities in social security legislation to home in on that group. However, it would be more sensible to have a cross-departmental examination of the subject to consider how better to tackle the problem—possibly as I said, through public law or other Home Office measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many groups have supported the view of the Minister's advisory committee about why the proposals should not be implemented. It was interesting to read in its report that the Social Security Advisory Committee almost felt that the Government were going to reject its major recommendation. It is worrying that, because of the nature of the problem, the Government should ignore its sound advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee put forward a secondary tranche of proposals about extending the exemptions to some of the vulnerable groups which I mentioned. It highlighted pregnant women—which the Government accepted-vulnerable women, people with disabilities and children aged 16 to 19. The committee recommended that those groups be excluded from the regulations. The Government, for no good reason that I can understand from reading the report, ignored most of those groups and took the most limited measures to accommodate the points made so eloquently by the advisory committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The range of issues raised in the debate in the other place and the overwhelming cross-party support for the advisory committee's view that the regulations should not be implemented both make the Government's position all the more staggering. It is an outrage that we are debating on 9 December regulations which were implemented on 3 December. That shows a contempt for the procedures of the House—for thoughtful debate about the issues raised by the changes. It is a sad day when we cannot influence, in a meaningful way, what the Government have decided to do. In spite of overwhelming opposition from all sectors, they have ploughed ahead with their decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Minister's assurance in the other place that the procedures will be carefully monitored and that they will be reconsidered if they do not work and detrimentally affect groups of vulnerable people. It would be better to debate such regulations before they were implemented than to ride roughshod over the absolute rights of the Opposition to consider and debate legislation. I hope that the Minister will justify these inadequate and irrelevant changes to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to inquire into the notion of being available for work as a requisite for obtaining benefit. At my surgery, I encountered the case of a man who had retired five years early. He had been substantially compensated for that early retirement, but he was registered so that the Department would continue to pay his national insurance contributions—what used to be known as his stamp. That expired after one year and he was then required to come to the social security office to prove that he was actively seeking work. He strongly objected to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
that because he was comfortably off and could afford to go away for a few days, but he was being required to report to his local social security office in order to have his stamp paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, a comfortably off person who has been entitled to have his contribution paid by the state, although looking forward to a substantial pension—perhaps the sort of person that the Minister is trying to deal with—was not actively seeking work, but was actively trying to get the Government to continue to pay his contribution after the initial year. I have no idea how many other people are in a similar position, but the Government should exclude them. I am not opposed to the regulations if that is their intention. Such cases should not detract from the genuine cases of people who may find it difficult to obtain work, but they are examples of abuse on which I seek the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee, but our proceedings are a pale reflection of the debate in the House of Lords. I agree with the hon. Member for Withington about the quality of that debate, which I studied and learned much from. It is ironic that it is the House of Peers that takes the time to deal on the Floor of the House with these fundamentally important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation is fundamentally different from most regulations that have been considered in Standing Committees in previous years. If I interpret it correctly, it withdraws hardship payments—the safety net—from claimants. So for the first time in my experience, the state will do absolutely nothing for one category of claimants. The Minister may be able to persuade me that he has the power to make such a change by regulation, but if I were in his shoes, I would have sent my departmental officials back to the drawing board and told them that I was not prepared to countenance such a change without the backing of primary legislation. No doubt, there will be all sorts of fun and games in the courts when the Government are challenged by way of judicial review about whether they have this power. I predict that, in three or four years' time, the Government will scurry back via yet another statutory instrument to reverse the anomolies that legislation such as this will produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the seriousness of the regulation, it should have been dealt with by full-scale primary legislation. The Department of Social Security has a standing slot in the legislative programme—I do not disagree with that: the system is important and must be updated, reviewed and changed year by year. It would not have cost the Government much to wait for the next social security Bill to make a fundamental change of this nature. The change may not affect thousands of people but, if the regulation is passed, people will be left without any cover at all in certain circumstances, for the first time since the Poor Law days. They will starve in the streets. The Minister shakes his head, as I would expect him to—that is what his brief instructs him to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulation is qualitatively different from any that I have considered before. The Committee should recognise that. The debate in the House of Lords was of a high quality and addressed the issues in a way in which we shall not have time to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I understand that the Department has introduced alternative strategies, which I have not studied in detail. The question of itinerant claimants is important. It will come back to haunt us in the future. I think that the Department is struggling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is difficult to know how to cope with people who are constantly on the move. I suspect that there will be more of them in future, so the Department will have to find ways of coping with them. This regulation is not the answer. Some of the alternative strategies and methods of dealing with itinerant claimants were beginning to work before this regulation was landed on us from on high as a result of the difficulties caused by the summer festivals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree that something must be done about summer festivals. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) and other hon. Members were in the front line in Wales when the Newtown festival happened. If people are determined to spend their weekends in that fashion during the summer, we should pick a spot somewhere out of the way and let them get on with it. [Hon. Members: "Roxburgh?"] There is a very nice aerodrome in Roxburghshire around which I could take the Committee on a tour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If proper facilities were provided and arrangements make, I am content in the assertion that it would be possible to organise such festivals so that people can do what they have to, in a way that does not invade other people's privacy or rip off the social security system. The current arrangements are entirely unsatisfactory; we must address the issue from a public order direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trying to deal with the problem by changing social security regulations is extremely dangerous for the simple reason that the system is so complicated that, if changes are made at one end, the changes that come out at the other are unforeseeable. We have experience of that. No matter how clever the computers, how good the models or how clever the Department officials—to whom I pay tribute for their splendid work—there are circumstances in which, even with due consideration, the result will be unforeseeable commissioner's decisions which will prejudice claimants in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking this route is fraught with danger, even if the Government really have the power to introduce the regulations in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some comfort can be gleaned from the concluding paragraph of the SSAC's report on the regulations. If it were possible—and it is impossible to tell from the regulations—to give adjudication officers overriding discretion to make hardship payments in difficult cases, that would comfort me somewhat. I do not know whether there is an overriding discretionary power for that anywhere within the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have my answer. There obviously is not. The Social Security Advisory Committee would not have raised it if there were and it is important for the Committee to know that. If there is no overriding discretion to make hardship payments, at least when doubt about entitlement arises, that can still be considered by the adjudication officer. However it is a very serious situation which I predict will create enormous difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim that thousands of people will be affected, but those who are may be left without any cover of any kind. As people no longer starve in the streets, they will take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
to crime or drugs or both, and end up being incarcerated. If one compares the £20.15 of the hardship payment now with the amount of money needed to look after drugs addicts, pay for rehabilitation centres or keep prisoners at Her Majesty's pleasure, that cost-benefit analysis makes no sence at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations concern me. They are fundamentally different from those that we have previously considered. I await the Minister's speech with interest.

The debate has been a re-run of one of the great debates of the past—that about the actively seeking work rule. Many of the serious concerns raised by Opposition Members have been a re-run of those fears. I do not minimise them and I want to reassure hon. Members on them. At the outset, two matters are significant. The hon. Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and for Withington both queried the fact that we were having the debate after the regulations had been implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman, but he must remember that other people have come through the system in order to sit on the Opposition benches. If he wishes his party to become the official Opposition or to become the Government, he must fight the same battle as that of the Labour Party when it was established. There is no need to change the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of priorities. The issue is important and the hon. Member for Withington cannot have it both ways. If the other place had a distinguished debate, and if the regulations have the serious import which the hon. Gentleman has suggested—all hon. Members have received briefs stressing their import as some pressure groups see it—his colleagues should be here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the Minister is protesting too much about the procedure this morning. We are debating some serious points in an unsatisfactory way. If the Minister believed what he was saying and took the regulations as seriously as we do, he would have arranged for a debate on them in Government time on the Floor of the House. We would have welcomed that opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are not many Opposition Members here and we have not had a debate on the Floor of the House because the fears about the regulations have been vastly overblown. I hope to satisfy and reassure the Committee on their import. That is why they are being dealt with in a low-key way. They are not as serious as the hon. Member for Withington suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in preparation for this morning's debate, I had browsed through the Official Report of the Committee stage of the Social Security Act 1989, which introduced the actively seeking work test it would have struck me forcefully that the arguments put forward then have simply been in the litany of charges made against the regulations by the Opposition today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition, as always, are locked in a time warp, but the world has moved on. In drawing up the regulations, we have been able to take account of the evidence that has accumulated over the past three years in relation to the actively seeking work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me spell out clearly what the regulations do. In order to claim income support on the basis of unemployment, claimants must make themselves available for work. They must also actively seek work. At present, those claimants who do not look for work remain eligible for a reduced rate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
of income support if they would otherwise suffer hardship. Such payments can be made for an indefinite period. It is therefore possible for people who have no interest in finding work to continue to receive benefit intended to assist the unemployed while they look for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That cannot be right. The Government have concluded that able-bodied single people and childless couples who flout the rules should lose entitlement to income support. Where the claimant or their partner is in receipt of child benefit, pregnant or in receipt of a disability premium, income support will continue to be available to avoid hardship. The needs of the most vulnerable are therefore protected in the new regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about ensuring that those who do not flout the rules will continue to receive benefit, will the Minister confirm that those who are considered to be flouting the rules, but for which there is no evidence, will be denied benefit during the period of investigation even if, subsequently, they are found to be innocent? At a crucial time, not only will they not be entitled to income support, but they will also lose their entitlement to other benefits, such as housing benefit. I realise that it might be for two weeks only, while the adjudication officer considers the case, but, during that time, people who are subsequently found innocent, will receive no financial support. How can the Government justify that? Surely, claimants should retain the right to benefit while investigations are taking place? If they are subsequently found guilty, the situation should then be regularised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, but I shall come to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle behind the regulations is that those able to help themselves must do so. The option of living off the taxpayer in open contempt of the benefit rules will cease to exist. As I have already mentioned, the actively seeking work test is not new. It was introduced in 1989 to motivate people to accept their personal responsibility to look for work.—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Several hon. Members are not the slightest bit interested in listening and they are making a lot of noise. I hope that they will listen to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Dunn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dartford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the actively seeking work test was introduced, those opposed to it warned that it would have grave consequences. The Opposition said repeatedly that the regulations would be used to punish inadequate or vulnerable people whose personal circumstances or mental or physical limitations would leave them unable to meet their requirements; exactly the same arguments as those advanced by hon. Members this morning. But what has actually happened? The employment service has administered the test fairly and sensitively, taking full account of the difficult labour market conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the introduction of the rule, only about 2,500 people a year have fallen foul of it. That is about two people per office per year, yet 1.5 million people regularly sign on. If that rule, which is the trigger for the regulations, were to have the effect suggested by the Opposition, we would have been flooded out with such cases, but we have not been. No member of the Committee has had cause to write to me about the actively seeking work rule. Criticism is
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
conspicuous only by its absence. Rarely can legislation so vilified in its passage through Parliament have been so quickly accepted as fair and reasonable by the public, including the vast majority of unemployed people themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must remind the Committee, despite what has been said today, that the regulations do not change the actively seeking work test in any way. The crux of the problem is that a small minority of claimants make no effort to look for work. They are able and content to receive a reduced rate of income support indefinitely. The Regulations prevent that abuse of public funds. The public overwhelmingly supports the action we have taken. The Government recognise, however, the important role that they must play in helping people back to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge the seriousness of yesterday's debate. Unemployment is a scourge. Long-term unemployment is a serious debilitating factor in any nation. All western industrial nations are getting to grips with unemployment, which has become endemid in a way that was never imagined. Steps are being taken to tackle it. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment told the House on 12 November that spending on Department of Employment programmes next year will increase by £177 million; a rise of 50 per cent. Nearly 500,000 extra opportunities will be available to unemployed people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But hon. Members should remember also that two thirds of unemployed people find work within six months of becoming unemployed. There is no penalty for failing to find a job, only a requirement that people should take reasonable steps to find one. The tax-paying public understand the plight of the unemployed and welcome the importance of using public funds to help them, but they have no time for those who seek to abuse the public purse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to spend a little time in dealing with the main criticism that has been levelled at the regulations; namely that they do not go far enough in protecting vulnerable and inadequate people. I understand the worries that have been expressed, but I hope to answer such concerns and reassure hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When interviewing a claimant about his job search, the claimant adviser must take into account all the claimant's circumstances. There is no question of requiring people to seek jobs that they could not do, or jobs for which they are not qualified. The level of employment locally available must be taken into account, as must a person's age and any physical or mental limitations. That is how the test previously has been applied and how it will continue to be applied. I repeat that there is no evidence that vulnerable people have been adversely affected by the introduction of the actively-seeking work-test and there in no reason why they should be adversely affected by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the regulations is to cause those who wilfully refuse to contemplate work to lose their benefit for a short period—one or two weeks—which will coincide with the signing period at the unemployment benefit office. The aim behind the regulations is to influence the behaviour of those who do not look for work. If the claimant then takes the action required of him, benefit will be restored the next time he signs on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the specific concerns raised by the hon. Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and for Withington and by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). We did not accept the advice of the Social Security Advisory Committee because, as its title
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
states, it is an advisory committee. Sometimes we agree with its advice, sometimes we do not. Its advisory role is similar to that of the Labour party conference—sometimes its advice is accepted in policy, sometimes it is not. If I remember correctly, the Labour party conference passed a motion condemning the Child Support Act 1991. Last week, the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) was at pains to say that that was not Labour party policy. We listen very carefully to the advisory committee—sometimes we agree with it, sometimes we do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not especially want to pursue the point about the Labour party, but a conference resolution becomes Labour party policy if it is passed by a two thirds majority on the conference floor. The Social Security Advisory Committee was unanimous in its recommendation that the Government should not proceed with their plans. As the Minister has drawn comparisons between the two bodies, perhaps he should not proceed with the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of judgment in all cases. We did not accept the advisory committee's recommendation because of our strong belief that the regulations will not result in the circumstances feared by the advisory committee. We accepted two of its secondary recommendations, but not the major one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not accept some of the advisory committee's subsidiary recommendations because the adjudication officers have been sensitive to the categories of people mentioned in the report and have encountered few cases under the rules. The hon. Member for Withington kindly expressed his appreciation of what my noble Friend the Minister in the other place said to allay concern. The adjudication officer is required to take all circumstances of the claim into account when deciding what are reasonable steps for a person take actively to seek work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People such as carers and women in refuges, are not available for work because of their circumstances, and they are treated accordingly. The regulations do not amend the hardship provision in the availability for work rule, so they should not affect those in such circumstances. The evidence suggests that that has not been a problem. The application of the test will be carefully monitored to ensure that we do not catch those people who some fear we might catch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the assurance that the availability-for-work rule, especially as it relates to vulnerable groups, will not be changed, that those people will be deemed to be unavailable for work, and that the two regulations will not conflict. I am concerned that, as the Minister and his noble Friend in the other place said, the regulations are carefully monitored to ensure that they are working and that vulnerable groups are not treated unfairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been sensitivity about the actively-seeking work-rule because the benefit officers know the job market in their area and recognise people's circumstances. They have been clear about the interpretation of that rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential conflict between availability and actively-seeking work needs to be carefully monitored. Will the Minister tell us what research, evaluation and monitoring his Department will establish to ensure that vulnerable groups will not be affected by the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point and I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's constructive approach to the issue. I recognise his fears and those of others, but I am confident that those problems will not occur, because of the way in which the test has been and will be applied. I intend to keep the test monitored within the Department and through the relevant agency. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the precise details of how we intend to do that, instead of giving an off-the-cuff answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington raised a couple of other issues, which I shall briefly discuss. On the removal of the warning letter, the Government thought it correct when the actively-seeking-work test was first introduced in 1989 to give an undertaking that people would be given a written warning if their job search was inadequate. We have honoured that commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test has been in operation for three years and has been accepted as fair and reasonable by the public, including those who are unemployed—they know about it. All newly unemployed people receive a detailed interview at which the actively-seeking-work test is explained. A personal back-to-work plan is devised and the consequences of failing to look for work are explained. Those who have genuinely misunderstood what is expected of them will continue to receive written warnings, but others will no longer be able to exploit the warning letter to regularly evade their responsibility to look for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employment service research, using a sample of almost 900 people, showed that 16 per cent. were warned at least twice and some five times or more during the same period of unemployment. The new administrative arrangements will end that abuse. We are relying on adjudication officers being entitled to examine all the circumstances, including the availability of work, in their area and applying them with sensitivity. As the consequences of not following a pattern of job search are explained exhaustively to the claimant in the first place, we think that that is reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was that the Minister's response to my question about the denial of entitlement or will he deal with that now? I do not want to miss the opportunity to press that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perceptive as always and I shall answer his question next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to suspend benefit is not new. The Secretary of State has the power to suspend benefit where there is a doubt about whether the conditions of benefit have been fulfilled. The primary purpose of a suspension is to reduce the risk of benefit being overpaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suspension is not automatic. It depends on the degree of doubt and individual circumstances. Physical and mental health can be taken into account. A decision to suspend benefit will be taken only after a detailed personal interview at which the claimant will be given every opportunity to make his case. In any case in which benefit is suspended, the adjudication officer must be asked to reach a decision as soon as possible—within 14 days as far as is practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that suspension of benefit because of a doubt about active job search is for a maximum of two weeks. If at the next signing-on date normal conditions of entitlement are satisfied, payment of benefit will resume irrespective of whether the adjudication officer has reached a decision about the earlier period. Claimants will not be penalised if there is a delay in the adjudication process. Again, we rely on the sensitivity and the sensible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
application of the rules by the adjudication officers to ensure, by way of personal interview and personal determination that, where there is any doubt, benefit will not be suspended. We are looking only for a minority of the worst abusers through the regulations. I can assure the hon. Member for Withington of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Although I am sure that the regulations will affect only a few cases I still have grave anxieties about people losing their benefit for even two weeks. Two weeks without money is a lifetime and people can get into terrible predicaments. They might not be able to pay the rent or buy food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am unable to change the regulations, I am most concerned to receive assurances from the Minister that adjudication and benefit officers will be instructed to interpret the regulations in the most sensitive way possible. Can the Minister give us information about the guidelines to be issued to benefit officers? If those guidelines have not yet been issued, will he send me a copy of them to reassure me further that the regulations will be sensitively administered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rely on the judgment of officers, and the way in which they have exercised that judgment over the past three years, for evidence of how existing guidelines have been interpreted. I may include a comment about that in the letter that I intend to send to the hon. Member for Withington as a result of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington said that the impact of the regulations would be much reduced if people who made themselves unavailable for work still qualified for hardship payment. We might be unfairly criticised for trying to protect the most vulnerable. We did not want the test to affect the availability-for-work rule because we want the most vulnerable people to be covered by the availability-for-work regulations. We want to make sure that people who are genuinely unavailable for work will not be hit. That is why we intend to follow those procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept, however, that those who deliberately try to evade work would be able to include themselves artificially in that category. We should rely on the judgment of the adjudication officers in relation on that and should not underestimate their good sense. We have also been able to try some new measures that fix more clearly those who should run foul of the regulations and whose behaviour we want to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since August a special additional questionnaire has been testing more rigorously the job search of itinerant claimants in particular. In the south-west region, seven travellers were referred to adjudication following interviews at which the questionnaire was used. We shall monitor the new arrangements carefully and, if there is evidence of people trying to exploit the new rules, we shall reconsider the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and for Withington felt that the Government should do something, but did not specify what. They suggested that the matter should be considered with other Departments. That is what we are doing. We recognise that the problem is connected with large gatherings of travellers and does not relate to social security alone. The problem is complex and is at present receiving concerted action by several Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
The problem concerns not just the misuse of public funds, but antisocial and often illegal behaviour, which causes great offence and nuisance to local communities. Social security legislation by itself cannot prevent the unacceptable, large-scale invasions we saw this summer. The police, therefore, have improved their intelligence networks and have liaison arrangements in place to help prevent gatherings of travellers from building up into huge numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also considering proposals that might, for example, give the police the power to direct people to leave land if the police reasonably believe that there will be serious distress to the community from, for example, amplified music at night. The police may also be given powers to turn back vehicles within a specified distance of a venue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also intend to strengthen the Public Order Act 1986 in respect of aggravated trespass. That move should be most welcomed by landowners who fear invasions and desecration of their land. To deal with these concerns, Departments other than the Department of Social Security are considering those issues. The Department of Social Security is not deliberately singling out a particular group of people. The tests aim to reinforce the position so that those looking for work do so actively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay will read the proceedings assiduously and will, no doubt, return so that I can talk to her. She asked how the regulations would affect a retired person who is required to register. People over the age of 60 are excluded from the requirement to report in order to receive credits. Those who do not actively want to look for work have the option of paying voluntary class 3 contributions to protect their state pension. I am happy to discuss that point with my hon. Friend again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the length and quality of the debate in the other place, the hon. Members for Withington and for Roxburgh and Berwickshire have raised all the issues that were discussed there and have argued their case well. I tried to give reassurance, as did my noble Friend the Minister in the other place, that their fears are unfounded. Had their fears been well-founded, we would have seen greater problems with the actively-seeking-work test in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On monitoring, I assure the Committee that we shall ensure that the rule is sensitively implemented and that it achieves its objective. It is right that unemployed people should be actively seeking work because it is right that those who support the unemployed with taxpayers' money should feel that it is going to those who require it. The very small minority who try to evade the rules should no longer be able to do so at taxpayers' expense. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.10 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his assurances and I look forward to receiving them in writing as soon as possible so that we can monitor the consequences of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still uneasy about the ability to suspend benefit immediately. Research into the actively-seeking-work rule has shown that two thirds of those for whom benefit was suspended were subsequently found to be innocent. If we widen the net and the potential hardship arising from not receiving benefit, we are on dangerous ground. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire said, there is ample evidence to show that if people have no income and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
no food, they may move to crime and the other social consequences of destitution. That is what the Government propose for that group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not accept from what I said and from the evidence of the past three years, that people would have to try very hard to fall foul of the regulations? The figure of two per year per office throughout the country does not suggest that we are looking actively for people to come within the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In statistical terms, the Minister is right, but we must ensure that we are not making changes that will increase that statistical level and that more people do not suffer hardship because of those changes. The monitoring will prove the point one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the Government's proposed range of options to deal with the problem. I wish that they had been introduced as quickly as the changes in the social security regulations. We seem to be tackling the problem the wrong way round. We should consider the law and order and public order measures before making hasty changes in social security legislation, which may not hit the target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wide-ranging regulations may hit many vulnerable groups and that is not the most sensible way in which to proceed. I wish that the panoply of alternative legislation had been introduced first so that the regulations could be seen in the context of that other legislation rather than in isolation. If the proposed alternative legislation had been
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
introduced first, it might not have been necessary to change the regulations because the regulations and the administrative procedures based on them may have been sufficient. We might not have had to attack other people who are totally innocent of charges that the Government may wish to levy against new age travellers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister tried to reassure us, I leave the Committee with great anxieties about the changes in the regulations. The Opposition will monitor the changes carefully and I welcome the Government's assurance they will do that as well. If there are widespread difficulties of interpretation and vulnerable groups of people fall foul not only of the rule on actively seeking work but of the availability of work rule and the inter-relationship of the two regulations, I hope that the Government will return to the House with subsequent amendments to protect those vulnerable people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made our position absolutely clear. We strongly support the advisory committee recommendation that the changes should not be proceeded with and that remains our position. Having put our views on the record, we feel it unnecessary to divide the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
