	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>The the Committee has considered the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Establishment and Constitution) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the National Institute for Clinical Excellence Regulations 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham. The Opposition sought this debate because the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will become a significant part of the national health service infrastructure, and the guidance that it issues will directly affect the lives and well-being of millions of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the United Kingdom will have assumed that, as NICE is a key part of the Government's health programme, the provisions to establish it would be found in the Government's keynote Health Bill. Not so. By creating NICE as a special health authority, the Government are sneaking it into being through the back door without proper scrutiny of its real function and the place that it will have in the so-called new NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately for democracy, the Opposition in another place used their ingenuity—and, perhaps, the somewhat laxer rules that apply there—to enable some debate on the institute to take place on Second Reading and during consideration in Committee of the Health Bill, but we believe that important matters need to be aired, hence our request for the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, to give them their due, are skilful manipulators of language. Yesterday, we heard from the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the new economy. We have become used to hearing from the Secretaries of State for Education and for Health about investment—no longer are they spending; they now invest. We also learned recently that nurses' pay has been modernised. I am now waiting for my children to apply for a modernisation of their pocket money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What could sound nicer than NICE? What could be more uncontroversial than a body entitled the National Institute for Clinical Excellence? Everyone is in favour of excellence. It sounds as though the institute should take a place alongside the national institute for motherhood and apple pie. However, language can deceive: new Labour, new speak. This NICE will be nasty. Although the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
for Health continues to deny that there is rationing in the NHS, and despite all the evidence—and the overwhelming body of qualified opinion—that rationing exists, he is introducing a body that will institutionalise and formalise that rationing while seeking to distance himself from rationing decisions and masking them in a cloak of clinical legitimacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that NICE will be charged with examining the clinical effectiveness of treatments. That makes perfect sense as it will bring together activity that is presently spread throughout different bodies. However, the institute will also take account of the cost effectiveness of such treatments. I do not recoil from the need to consider cost as well as clinical effectiveness, but nor do I recoil from the R word. We all know that rationing exists in the NHS. The Minister of State knows it, but he will not admit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not, without comment from the Conservative party, allow the Government to introduce a major rationing tool without their acknowledging it for what it is or even that rationing exists and that it is, indeed, a key function of NICE. Let us make no mistake, NICE will be the national institute for control of expenditure. It will bring together coherently and consistently many informal systems of rationing in the NHS. It will rule out treatments and drugs on a national basis when previously that was done only piecemeal on a local basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The claim that that may be a better way of rationing than the present system cannot be made by a Government who deny that rationing exists and who apparently live in a world where all patients receive all treatments that are of clinical benefit to them. Wherever that fantasy world is, it is not the United Kingdom in 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of the work of NICE will be evaluating new drugs and treatments, and some established ones, to arrive at a cost-benefit analysis of their delivery via the NHS. Ministers would not describe the position as such because using such brutal economic language does not suit them, but that is what NICE will be doing. Having carried out that analysis, NICE will have to say which treatments in a rescource-constrained NHS should be delivered and, thus, by extension which treatments should not be available and which patients should be left untreated. I have spelt out my worries because I live in hope that the Minister will acknowledge that a large part of NICE'S job is to do the dirty work, make difficult assessments and arrive at the tough decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessarily wrong that there should be an entity that takes such decisions rigorously and consistently, but it is wrong that the Government, out of political cowardice, refuse to acknowledge that central role of NICE. They hide behind its misleadingly comforting title when, in reality, its primary role relates to cost effectiveness, not clinical excellence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Should anyone think that I am merely fantasising, the chairman-designate of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, stated that affordability has to be taken into account. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It's no good us recommending a therapy if there isn't any money available".</p></blockquote>
If the Department of Health advises NICE that a treatment could not be afforded, NICE would, said Professor Rawlins,
	<br><blockquote><p>"say that it is clinically effective, but that we are unable to recommend it as there are insufficient resources to make it available to the patients".</p></blockquote>
What price clinical excellence? To my simple mind, that is as clear a definition of rationing health care as one could seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the Minister has to do is say, "Rationing exists."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>

	<p>4.53 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that the Minister has to do is say, "Rationing exists. It is piecemeal at the moment, and we believe that there is a better way to do it." The real debate could then begin. So long as Ministers deny the central function of NICE, any debate will inevitably take place in a surreal atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doctors at all levels—primary and secondary—are facing unprecedented interference in their freedom to prescribe. NICE, coupled with the computer-based Prodigy system and cash-limited drugs budgets, will lead to a massive increase in centralisation and bureaucracy in clinical judgment. Doctos will be put under extreme pressure professionally, through the Commission for Health Improvement, financially, through the cash-limited drug budgets, and because of the liability to follow NICE guidance and Prodigy recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The medical profession is becoming increasingly aware of what is going on. Hence the Government's reluctance to include NICE in the Health Bill, thereby avoiding the risk of facing detailed criticism of the institute's intended function. Indeed, Dr. Andrew Dearden of the British Medical Association's general practitioners' committee has said that although he accepts the need for cost-effectiveness, he increasingly fears that NICE is about cost first and effectiveness second.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order does not, of course, define the role of NICE. To have done so would have let the rationing cat out of the Government's bag. It simply says that NICE will
	<br><blockquote><p>"perform such functions in connection with the promotion of clinical excellence in the health service as the Secretary of State may direct."</p></blockquote>
Although we are becoming used to massive use of secondary legislation by the Government, that appears to raise the technique to a new art form. The order is, essentially, an empty piece of secondary legislation,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
with the meat to be put on it by directions from the Secretary of State that will not be subject to any form of parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know what the Secretary of State has in mind for NICE, because he has told us. We know what its function will be in his scheme of things. I am not a lawyer, but I wonder whether the role cast for the institute can be fitted into the definition in article 3, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Institute shall perform such functions in connection with the promotion of clinical excellence in the health service as the Secretary of State may direct."</p></blockquote>
Given what we know about the Government's intentions for NICE, and what the chairman-designate has already admitted about its functions, I wonder whether at some stage suitably disaffected patients or professionals might challenge the validity of directions to NICE currently intended by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the regulations form the longer document, I have little to say about them except that the army of draftsmen that the Department has at its disposal might have been expected to get the year right in the definition of "the Act". If I am not mistaken, the National Health Service Act referred to is 1977, not 1997. I cannot say what effect that has on the validity of the regulations, but undoubtedly it needs to be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order and regulations establish an important body whose function is deliberately concealed through the use of language. Clinical excellence should be uncontroversial, as should an institute bearing that title. The Government's almost Orwellian preversion of language has made it controversial. The rationing debate, including the debate about the mechanics of rationing, needs to be held in the open. That requires a Government acknowledgement that rationing exists. In my humble opinion, the Government should separate clinical excellence from rationing control by limiting the function of NICE to examining clinical issues, so that it can enjoy universal support, while creating an explicitly political body to make rationing decisions for which politicians should rightly take responsibility in a democratic society, instead of sheltering behind a linguistic and institutional smokescreen. If the Government would openly acknowledge the problem of unlimited demand and finite resources in our health services, stop pretending that all patients receive all treatment from which they could benefit clinically, and engage in a mature debate about the future resourcing of the health service—I believe that, sticking my neck out, I speak on behalf of both Opposition parties—we could engage constructively in such a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those hoping for an outbreak of frankness on the part of the Government, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is not an encouraging sign. Unless radical changes are made to its proposed function, or the Government acknowledge that rationing exists and needs to be rationalised, its prime purpose will be seen as providing a fig leaf for Government in rationing health care, while continuing to deny that such rationing exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. We agreed earlier that because I had some substantive questions, I would table them early to allow him to compose his replies. I was grateful for that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with my questions on the text of the orders and then make a few general comments, some of which have been provoked by the Conservative spokesman, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). I agree that paragraph 3 of order No. 220 is grossly inadequate as an overt way of saying what the institute will do. Even if the matter did not involve rationing and was all of the worthy things that the Government talk about, while not using the R word, it is such an important issue for the health service that it is right and proper that it should be discussed openly and subject to scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Minister for time for a substantial debate, preferably on the Floor. It does not have to be partisan, although that may be inevitable, given the importance of the NHS. Beneath the party political point scoring, there are important issues to discuss. One of the most important matters for the future of the health service is how this issue is handled. It deserves parliamentary time, which is difficult to achieve without a framework set out in orders or regulations—or, preferably, primary legislation. The Liberal Democrats would co-operate on a Bill that would allow an informed debate in Committee or on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The error pointed out in order No. 260 by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is there for all to see. We noted it, too. My specific questions refer to paragraphs 2 and 3. We note that seven members, a chairman and four officers will be appointed by the Secretary of State. We have seen draft consultation papers on who might be appointed, but we are anxious to ensure that there is patient input into such a body. It would be welcome if that could be specified at a senior level. Perhaps the vice-chairman could be from one of the patient groups. Representing the diverse interests of various patient bodies is a large responsibility for one person, or even for two people on a partners council. We want to ensure that seniority is given to such a patient voice, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that concerns us is whether the meetings will be in public. In the appraisal committee, some issues may involve commercial confidence in respect of pharmaceutical companies or bodies that produce treatments, interventions, mechanical or medical devices for use in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As such matters are a horizon-scanning exercise, such substances will not have been marketed. Some of the information may be share-sensitive. I accept that some of the evidence should not be available in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
public arena. I shall discuss the drawbacks later, but because of the way in which the Government are handling rationing, it is important that such meetings of the main body are held in public and that there are papers available to inform public discussion. Commercially sensitive data may have to be expurgated from those documents, but the people looking at the functions of this important body, which will deal with details of cost effectiveness, should have access to them. Liberal Democrats want clear reassurances from the Minister that there will be freedom of information—I am sad to say that legislation to that effect has not yet been enacted—about the national institute, and that details of it will be open and explicit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned about the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Disability of Chairman and Members in Proceedings on Account of Pecuniary or Other Personal Interests",</p></blockquote>
which is the title of regulation 12. That relates to how it would be possible to bring in the expertise of clinicians, given that it may be felt that their research, staff and time are funded by pharmaceutical companies that have an interest in the national institute's findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two extreme approaches could be taken. One is that someone with a financial interest should immediately leave the room after declaring that interest when any matter that might relate to a pharmaceutical company is raised for discussion. The alternative, which I prefer, is to veer towards the other extreme and recognise that the state of basic science in universities and in the NHS is such that it would be in direr straits without the input of pharmaceutical companies. It should also be recognised that it is unlikely that the national institute will get the best advice if it shuns people who have engaged independent or other research for such companies. It is important that their expertise is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, any such interests should be declared. However, if post-doctoral students, half a day of whose time might be funded for research by a pharmaceutical company, had to leave the room, they would be incapable of providing much-needed input.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will look for a rational approach. We shall not point fingers at interests that exist, provided that they are declared and registered and exist from the outset. We live in a world where much of the clinical expertise is rightly sought not only by the NHS and Ministers, but by pharmaceutical companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to associate the official Opposition with the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I read carefully the provisions on interests, and came to the same conclusion as he did. Therefore, I decided not to mention it. We also think it very important that people with relevant information and knowledge are included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main issue is the nature of such decisions. The contribution of the hon. Member for Runnymead and Weybridge was interesting, and his points are valid, but Conservative Members must recognise that those points were equally valid ones, two, four or six years ago. To conservative Members' credit, they recognise that the issue is not new under this Government, and that they might have been more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
explicit about it. Liberal Democrats were concerned about the issue under the previous Government, and we raised it early in this Parliament. Our questions have been taken up by Conservative Front Benchers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We aim to be constructive. We do not see the rationing issue as a way to beat the Government over the head. Instead, we argue that recognising the situation would save the health service from the clutches of privatisation. If people do not understand that they will not receive some treatments until those treatments have been denied them—despite the fact that they have paid their taxes—they will be disillusioned. If they can afford to go private, or make sacrifices to do so, they will resent paying for private health care in addition to their taxes. They will be more unwilling to pay the taxation needed for the health service. Although the Government's intentions towards the health service are honourable, they may be killing it with kindness by denying that rationing takes place. They do not allow the public to express the view that more money should be spent on the health service—not only through the cumulative £21 billion of the comprehensive spending review, but through incremental increases that would raise the share of gross domestic product spent on health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such increased funding would mean that any rationing decisions would be on minor issues, not fundamental issues of effective treatment that the NHS cannot afford. If the Government acknowledged that rationing exists and said that if people agree to pay only a certain amount of taxation, they will get only a certain amount of NHS services, there may be—I would hope—a clamour for fairer taxation and spending on the NHS so that we would not have the sort of rationing decisions on vital treatment that we currently face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An alternative view, proposed by the Conservatives, is that we should abandon public funding of the NHS and collect extra money from private sources. That is a rational view although I do not agree with it; it threatens the NHS. It would require rationing to be made explicit so that people could plan their private provision. I do not believe that asking people not to use the NHS solves its problems, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman will clarify his party's position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While that is a view, it is not the view of the Conservative party. My right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) who has unfortunately had to leave the Committee, has already said that a future Conservative Government would commit themselves to year-on-year increases in tax-funded spending in the national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Government promised year-on-year increases in spending in real terms. They could be met by a lp above inflation rise in spending.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Campbell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blyth Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that the penny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the penny on income tax that my party proposed and which is ever-needed in my constituency. If the hon. Member for Blyth Valley (Mr. Campbell) had community hospitals threatened with closure and patients being denied treatment that is clinically necessary and cost-effective, he would not pour scorn on the idea that we need more funding for our public services. However, I shall not stray on to that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party has said that rationing should be recognised and that it will offer year-on-year increases in public spending, which is not much when a 3 per cent, increase in real terms is needed for the NHS to stand still in terms of wage rises, the price of new drugs and demographic changes. The proposed real terms increases are no comfort to the NHS. If we are to have an honest debate, we must recognise that. Before deciding how to fund an NHS that no longer has to ration such treatments, we must recognise that the pot is not big enough to deliver universal and equitable health care that is free at the point of delivery. Anyone having to pay prescription charges who is just outside the catchment net will know that the NHS is anything but free at the point of delivery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made the case for recognising that rationing exists so that we can have a debate of it. The Liberal Democrats have made an offer to the Government to take the debate out of the party political arena into a standing conference, with other sources of input, so that it is not used as an opportunity to score points over whether promises have been kept. If we do not have that debate, the NHS will be threatened by increasing Americanisation—the better-off going private and refusing to pay twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the order, because given that NICE is necessary to iron out inequalities in health— I accept the Government's thinking on that—there are two ways in which it could make recommendations. It could say that new or existing treatment is not efficacious or not safe—although in that case it is unlikely to have been given a licence—and is not clinically effective because it adds nothing to the range of treatments available to GPs. There is provision in the NHS for drugs to be blacklisted on grounds other than costs. Traditionally, schedule 10 has not been solely cost-based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that NICE can be a useful source of such information. As the chairman of the institute pointed out, it is peculiar that there are 167 guidelines for the treatment of asthma and that various health authorities are having to re-invent the wheel. With regard to clinical effectiveness, the proposal is a valuable step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NICE was originally to be set up as the national institute for clinical effectiveness. On 9 December, when the NHS White Paper was published, a press release from the Department of Health stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A new body, the National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness, will promote high quality guidelines for treatment, based on the best evidence."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
That body later became NICE. Was it originally called the national institute for cost-effectiveness, and was a clinical aspect added to it? Clearly, Government Departments have been considering the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to clinical effectiveness, the relevant proposals could work if the decisions are made public. Policitians need not get involved in decisions about clinical effectiveness. It would be harmful if the Secretary of State defended rationing by referring to clinical effectiveness rather than to cost-effectiveness, or if he tried to hide behind clinical effectiveness by announcing, for example, that a treatment for impotence was effective in relation to diabetes but not in relation to cardiovascular disease—the evidence suggests that the reverse is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politicians should not get involved in questions of efficacy—those issues are best dealt in an open debate that is clinically led but in which patients have an input. The issue should be dealt with in an holistic manner—it should not be based purely on pharmacology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NICE could also offer advice by arguing that the cost-effectiveness of a drug could not be assessed. That does not mean that the drug does not work; it suggests that NHS resources should be used on another treatment for the same condition—which may or may not be better tolerated but which was more cost effective—or that such resources should be used in another treatment area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers should formally recognise the fact that the clinicians who take such decisions cannot put more resources into the system to change the variable. The democratic body that is charged with funding the health service should say, "Experts have advised us that with the current funding envelope for the NHS, a particular treatment cannot be justified on the ground of cost-effectiveness." Limited drug budgets and the fact that health authorities have to balance their books mean that such steps are already being taken, although political accountability is not involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were to introduce political accountability in this context, we should welcome it. We therefore give half a cheer for the Government's approach to sildenafil—Viagra—which is a treatment for impotence. The Government took responsibility for saying that we should not spend more in that context. However, we are concerned about the fact that they cloaked their decision in an inequitable system for establishing who should receive treatment. That system cannot be defended on the grounds of ethics, equity or efficiency. However, the fact that the Government took responsibility was welcome, and I hope that the matter will be further debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines that are produced should inform NICE and its constituent bodies that any advice that is based on cost-effectiveness should be subject to a ministerial announcement and to the Minister's taking responsibility for the fact that cost is a factor. Politicians should not normally interfere in questions
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
of clinical effectiveness. Could that proposal be included in the documentation? I should be happy to write to the Minister about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rationing, the inequities of service provision and the fact that certain provisions cannot be made for reasons of cost-effectiveness must be seen to be politicians' responsibility. Their responsibility should not be hidden behind other bodies, such as health authorities, GPs or clinically-led bodies, including NICE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, we give half a cheer for the establishment of NICE, but we hope that the Minister will take on board our valid concerns not only for those concerned solely with party politics but for professionals and patient groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.19 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Denham)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon for giving half a cheer for our proposals. He is slightly less enthusiastic than the royal colleges, the other 52 professional bodies that supported our approach to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 37 community health councils and other patient groups. The response of those in the front line is somewhat warmer than anything I have heard this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on his perceptiveness: the Act should be dated 1977, not 1997. The remainder of his speech was less acutely focused, but on that point he was absolutely correct. A correction slip may be required if the regulation has to be amended. I hope that that will not prevent us discussing the important issues raised today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was right about the Government's commitment to modernise public services. It is important that we leave behind the many years of neglect; we want to ensure that public services are equipped for the 21st century. That commitment extends to modernising the national health service, and ensuring that high quality services are available to all patients, wherever they live. Our commitment is to tackling problems head on, and to improving the standards of quality of NHS care for all patients, throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that our saying that we need to make the best use of resources immediately justifies the claim that we are talking about rationing. It is self-evident that part of the process of modernising the NHS will be to make the most effective use of our resources. Many have commented on the fact that some treatments are available in one area but not another—so-called postcode prescribing. If we wish the NHS to make the best use of the resources provided for health care, it is important that every part of the service should have clear guidance about the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of treatment. We are establishing NICE because we want to ensure that the NHS provides the best possible care with the available resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the present geographical inequalities in the availability of various treatments. Will he assure the Committee that the process will be one of levelling up, and that we shall not discover that the imposition of uniformity will result in treatments that are currently available in some areas and not in others becoming unavailable in any area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall be ensuring that a consistent body of advice and guidance is available throughout the NHS. At the moment, individual bodies, often health authorities, are making decisions and drawing on advice from a disparate set of sources that do not necessarily hang together, and which have not necessarily been assessed on the same basis. Providing a consistent body of guidance will give those working in the NHS a consistent set of tools with which to make judgments. We believe that patients have the right to expect the NHS to take full account of best practice, based on advances in medical research, and we want to support health professionals by enabling them to know which treatments are most clinically effective and cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The institute will play a central role in the achievement of three core components of the plan to modernise the NHS. First, NICE will promote innovation and quality in the NHS—a fact that has not yet been mentioned. It will identify those developments that have the greatest potential to improve patient care, and it will help spread those new treatments across the NHS much more quickly than before. New treatments for common diseases have been developed—for example, clot-busting drugs or curing ulcers without surgery—yet, all too often, it has taken months, years or even decades for those treatments to be used throughout the NHS. If NICE can bring that sort of knowledge to our front-line NHS staff more quickly, it would be a great step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, NICE is essential for our plans for fair and equal treatment of patients within a health service that is truly national. Internal markets and postcodes were never an acceptable way to run a health service. NICE guidelines will provide a common effectiveness foundation for the NHS. It will inform and assist those making decisions about care—nationally and locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try once more, as the Minister has raised the subject again. Is it possible, as a result of that process, that treatments that are currently available in some areas will no longer be available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A thorough scientific appraisal of the best available evidence should be undertaken. For instance, it may be found that a treatment simply did not work, or that a pharmaceutical, although not positively dangerous, should be available and licensed. Clinical judgment clearly has to be exercised by individual clinicians about individual patients, but if the solid body of evidence was overwhelmingly clear that a pharmaceutical simply did not work, we would expect to see that reflected in the pattern of treatment offered by the NHS. Except in special cases, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not expect the NHS or
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
individual clinicians to carry on with a treatment or procedure that did not work and brought no benefit to patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that NICE will have to consider whether a treatment is clinically effective and cost-effective. Obviously, I concur with the Minister that it would be appropriate to withdraw treatments that were found to be clinically ineffective. Is the Minister ruling out the possibility that a treatment that was currently available in one area would cease to be available in that area if it was found not to be cost-effective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we are talking about individual cases, health authorities will need to consider and reflect, and decide how to act upon guidance that is issued by NICE. Beyond that, it makes no sense to hypothesise. The hon. Gentleman asked me earlier about the impact of NICE guidance, and I think that I answered him fully—but perhaps not as he expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that if a drug clearly did not work, he would expect the guidelines to rule it out. Would he expect the guidelines to rule it out on cost? For instance, taxol is an extremely expensive treatment for ovarian cancer that is currently available in some areas but not others. It is a beneficial treatment for a few patients, and it could give them an extra lease of life. Could we expect NICE to rule it out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that taxol is a good example. The NHS would welcome a consistent body of advice on such drugs. At the moment, differing decisions are being taken in different places. Although we can never ensure absolute uniformity, one of the great advantages of NICE for the NHS will be a consistent body of advice against which decisions can be made. It would be wrong for me to anticipate the outcome of any named procedure, although many advocate the benefits of taxol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir David Madel 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from that, can we therefore expect a more even distribution of beta interferon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably unhelpful to speculate about any specific procedure; I do not have the scientific information to do so. Beta interferon has been approved for various conditions. Without the brief in front of me, it would be inappropriate to go into detail, but the hon. Gentleman will be aware that a recent approval has been given for a new set of conditions, including multiple sclerosis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, health authorities find themselves pretty much left to their own devices to make their own assessments and appraisals, possibly with support from regional level. NICE has not yet determined its programme, but the Committee should recognise that the ability to appraise such new procedures and to give consistent advice will improve the quality of decision making in the NHS. That is precisely what NICE has set out to do. It would not be sensible for me to attempt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
to speculate about the likely outcome for those or any of the other new pharmaceuticals of which we have read but which have not yet come on to the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that referring to individual cases does not take the debate forward. However, I hope that he will accept the point that I made earlier. If NICE decides that it is not cost-effective to use taxol for certain groups of patients, the Minister should be associated with that decision. People could then understand that such decisions are taken because the NHS has only a certain amount of funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If levelling up takes place—we hope it will, because that is where the problems lie—it will mean that resources must be taken from other treatments, because health authorities have only a fixed amount of money. It is worrying that no funds will be left for the last treatments that are appraised because the money will be used to level up all the other treatments. That problem must be recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members should keep their interventions short. They will have the opportunity to say what they want during their speeches. No one wants to curtail debate, but interventions should be short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The resources that are available to the NHS remain the responsibility of the Government. We are not franchising to NICE decisions about the level of resources in NHS. That has always been a matter for ministerial decision and of political accountability in elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on, I want to raise an important issue that is debated in my constituency. How do the proposals square with a GP's Hippocratic oath of having the freedom to prescribe? If he deems that a drug should be prescribed in certain case but protocols and NICE prevent him from doing so, how does the patient stand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members that time is limited and three or four more hon. Members want to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall touch on that point in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have probably said this several times in response to interventions, but the guidance that comes from NICE will provide a common effectiveness foundation for the NHS. It will inform and assist decision making about care at all levels—national, local and individual. It will provide a solid scientific basis for the treatment of patients, which will be considerably better than the vagaries of the internal market that have determined such factors until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, guidance from NICE will not end the need to take account of good, genuine clinical reasons for tailoring the care provided to individual patients. That issue must always be discussed with the individual patients in the consulting room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might not be aware— it happened before his appointment to his current role—that I asked the Secretary of State whether the guidance of NICE would be binding. He said that the guidance would not be formally binding but that he would not expect any health authority to do other than comply with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly clear that there must be room to say that a course of action is right if good, genuine clinical reasons have been identified for taking it. We are providing consistent guidance across the country. The warm welcome that NICE has had confirms that people in the NHS are seeking such advice, and that they will follow it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A variety of mechanisms in the approach to quality that we have proposed will enable people to examine or discuss any systematic variation from the advice, so that people can explain why they have taken a certain decision. It is reasonable to expect that, if we take the time and trouble to create a consistent body of information, the NHS and the health authorities will tend to follow that advice. We have had no indication other than that health authorities think that NICE will provide useful and consistent information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much debate about priorities. We have created NICE to deliver the best possible care by making the best use of resources. We shall spend about £ 164 billion in the NHS during the next four years, and we must make the best use of that investment to improve people's health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Priority setting has, and always will be, a feature of every health system anywhere in the world. The NHS is the most equitable way to use health resources that has been developed, and NICE will improve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Amess 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southend, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell the Committee how priority setting differs from rationing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have said on many occasions, if rationing is used simply to suggest that resources are finite—as they are in all walks of life—it is a meaningless observation. Resources are always finite. If rationing is used to mean that each person has a limited share and he or she is turned away when it is used up—as in many private insurance systems, in which people have to wait for a year or two if their policies have run out before they come back in to cover—it does not exist in the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one denies that there is a need to have the most effective system of priority setting in any health system, and the NHS, which does not differentiate between those who can or cannot afford to pay, happens to be a very good one. NICE will strengthen the system for priority setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the developments in medicine, it is in no one's interest to waste money on treatments that are not clinically effective or cost-effective. In future, we must make decisions on the basis of research evidence of the highest quality. NICE is creating the organisation and mechanisms that will enable us to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
It is important to acknowledge the excellent work of professional staff and academic researchers who have sought to push back the frontiers of medical knowledge. In recent years, the medical royal colleges, nurses, therapists and other professions have worked with researchers and the NHS to discover new treatments and to re-evaluate some existing treatments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pharmaceutical research promises to find new drugs that will start to tackle previously untreatable conditions. The Government's reforms will, for the first time, allow those innovators to achieve widespread adoption of their breakthrough treatments. I understand why those who develop effective new services become frustrated when it takes years for them to be adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some in the pharmaceutical industry are anxious that NICE might discourage the uptake of new products, or create bureaucratic obstacles. So I shall give a clear assurance straight away. We want successful innovation, offering genuine advances to patients at a fair and realistic price, to be actively promoted and encouraged. Where the evidence is convincing, NICE will do exactly that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we want to move away from the time when different, perhaps adjacent, health authorities, examined the evidence in different ways and came to different conclusions. Equally, where new products do not offer convincing advantages over existing tried-and-tested treatments, I expect NICE to say so, asking for further research where necessary or recommending that new treatments should not be routinely used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pharmaceutical industry is committed to innovation, not for its own sake, but to make a real impact on the lives of patients and their carers. It is committed to the fundamental principle of all good science, that promising ideas must be tested against hard evidence before they can be accepted in common practice. I do not believe that NICE will be an obstacle to innovation; it will reinforce good scientific practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the attention given to NICE—as demonstrated by our debate—has focused on the advice that it will give on significant new treatments, but it has other functions. NICE will agree its programme with the Department of Health and that programme will be driven by information from emerging horizon scanning and by the development of the national service frameworks and other major NHS priorities, including those outlined in "Our Healthier Nation". The guidance for NICE will include guidance for the management of certain diseases or conditions and on the appropriate use of interventions. NICE guidance will cover all aspects of a condition's management from self-care to primary care, secondary care and more specialist services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are too many sources of advice and guidance for the NHS; without criticising the many specialist societies or their guidance, the average general practitioner already feels bombarded from all sides by weighty and wordy guidelines. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to the example
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
given by Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, the chairman-designate of NICE, on the 170 different guidance procedures available for asthma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister acknowledge that all those sources give guidance purely on clinical effectiveness and that none of them takes account of cost-effectiveness? NICE will not merely replace the advice that those bodies give but put it into an entirely different context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not having read all 170 guidance procedures, I cannot say whether that is the case, although I would think that if there were, for example, two procedures to treat a child with asthma that were of equal clinical effectiveness, it would be of enormous advantage to GPs and others to know which of the two were the most cost-effective. Far from being a disadvantage, considering cost-effectiveness would be a great advantage. As that consideration works through the health service, it will lead not to loss of benefit to the patient but to a better use of NHS resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that some guidance refers to cost-effectiveness, because clinicians know that they have to work within cash envelopes. However, all the bodies that the Minister claims welcome NICE say that the Minister should take responsibility for the consequences of cost-effectiveness considerations—not just state that the Government fund it, but that, because they do so, they are also responsible for the fact that certain things cannot be afforded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can make progress: NICE will end the confusion that arises from the plethora of guidance. We want people to gain access to information or to straightforward advice from NICE, based on the best research evidence, by one phone call or one computer log-in. We want that advice to be provided not only to professional staff but to patients. Patients and carers will have full access to the information provided by NICE so that they will be as well informed about health topics and treatments. NICE will need to engage patients in the devlopment of guidelines; society no longer expects the issues to be handled by professional staff in isolation. NICE will be an inclusive organisation and its membership will be drawn from the health professions, the NHS, academics, health economists and patient interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the question asked by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, I confirm that it is important that patients' interests are represented in all NICE'S work. From a patient's point of view, quality has sometimes been neglected in the drawing up of professional guidelines in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the vast majority of responses to the consultation document on NICE, "A First Class Service—Quality in the new NHS", were supportive. We are keen for NICE to conduct its business openly. We have recently issued a discussion document on the detailed processes that NICE could use to appraise the cost-effectiveness of certain procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I understand that the appointment of vice-chairs will be a matter for the chair and the institute's members when it is established, but I note the important point that was made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. He is right to say that the regulation as drafted does not require public access to meetings of the institute's board. There is a case for that in the climate of openness and transparency, as he said, although he also acknowledged that issues of confidentiality would need to be protected. If the matter proved in practice to be a problem, it could be dealt with by further regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also questioned the promotion of the term "clinical excellence". The title for the organisation is right, as I think was shown by my examples about asthma. The rounded assessment that we propose is the right way to ensure clinical excellence in the national health service across the range of treatments that it provides. I note his argument, but I do not concur with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a danger. If we were to be literal, the Minister would have to accept that excellence sometimes has to be sacrificed to cost-effectiveness. There are some excellent but extremely expensive treatments for patients that result in cost-effective but less excellent treatments not being available. Excellence is sometimes the enemy of the good. If I were the Minister, I would not propose that NICE's name be taken too literally; otherwise, it would undermine the point that he wants to make about the importance of cost-effectiveness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we can agree to differ on that. In all that we have published about NICE, including the recent document on its approach to appraisal, we have made it clear that a rounded assessment of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is required to give those responsible for the health service the information that they need to make proper decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refute the idea that our debate represents an exercise in keeping discussion of NICE out of the public domain. In all the documents that we have published, including that about appraisal mechanisms, it has been clear what factors will be taken into account and how they will be used to allow NICE to develop as part of the good, consistent quality systems in the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special health authority route is appropriate to the establishment of NICE, which will be a key part of the national health service. Therefore, that proposal is not on the face of the Health Bill. The establishment of a special health authority is the appropriate legal mechanism for a body that will be an integral part of the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission for Health Improvement is not a part of the NHS, although it will inspect NHS bodies, and require new powers to establish the bodies that will be delivered in the Act. No serious case has been made that we tried to keep issues involving NICE under wraps or did not want open discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long. I had not intended saying anything, but as we have had only a churlish, halfhearted cheer for the new body, it is approriate for me to give a full-throated cheer on behalf of Labour Members. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear.]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Never mind the cheers; let us get on with the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was only the preliminary to my short remarks, Mr. Cunningham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was worse than churlish. He must have spent the night thinking up his rather limp jokes about NICE. Goodness knows what he will do with the Commission for Health Improvement, which I gather is called CHIMP—he will have another spleepless night. He said that NICE is Orwellian and then we had a knockabout about rationing. Does not that rather demean the issue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all the arguments that we have had about the health service, such as how much we spend and how many people work in it, the one area with which we have never come to grips is how effective it is at doing what it should be doing. That is a huge neglected area and the one that is being tackled by the the Government, through a variety of initiatives that will come together in the Health Bill, which is now going through the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of thinking about what could happen in future hypothetical cases? I am sure that we all have constituency experience. I remember a horrific case of a woman who had a treatment regime that did her enormous damage. When others, such as the General Medical Council, became involved in the matter, it turned out that, in good practice, that regime had been replaced years ago, and that the woman's treatment should never have proceeded in that way. The fact that effective clinical practice was not disseminated through the health service, with a clear focus and underpinning, to ensure that it got through the system, is the price being paid by patients. It is not only a question of future hypothetical examples. If the health service does not make sure now that effective treatments are carried out throughout the country, it is not the sort of health service that we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but I am sorry that he does not like my jokes. If the functions of NICE were limited to dealing with clinical effectiveness, we could all raise a cheer for it. However, we have a suspicion that there is another agenda involving rationing and cost, which causes us and the professions deep concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that was the point of my remarks. It is a shame to reduce an extremely serious and neglected matter, which is how to concentrate resources on effective treatments, into the usual political knockabout about rationing, which is not the issue. We are talking about how to use the always limited resources most effectively. We have not been

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
doing that; we need to do it; and, we need new machinery to enable us to do it. That is what the regulation is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amess</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman calls it knockabout stuff, which is his opinion, but it certainly is not mine. Will he tell us whether he thinks rationing exists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend the Minister gave a splendid answer to the previous intervention from the hon. Gentleman, so I shall not try to do better than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are matters that need to be raised, such as making sure that the independence of the new body is properly guaranteed. There are issues of clinical freedom and the need to guarantee experimentation that will produce advances from, sometimes, unlikely quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise the consumer side of the issue. If the body does not have consumer credibility, it will be less effective than it could be. It is important to have people in significant positions to represent consumers and to allow proper access to proceedings and documents. It is important, too, to get patient versions of the guidance that will be produced. It should not be a professional exercise; the public should be included. If they are not, the effectiveness of the body will be much reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NICE is a critical part of a new health agenda, which should have existed long since. If we had given attention to quality, clinical effectiveness and clinical audit, underpinned by the proper procedures, some of the tragedies, including the Bristol case, may not have occurred. NICE does matter, as do all the other initiatives connected with it in the new health agenda, and I give it more than a half-hearted cheer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to be unkind to the Minister—or perhaps I do—but, if I had any enthusiasm for NICE when I came to the Committee, having listened to his response to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I have lost it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not address any of the issues, but he started by saying that we were being churlish. I can tell the hon. Member for Blyth Valley that the Conservatives will have no truck with the Liberal Democrats. The Labour party is in bed with them, just as it is in Southend council and other authorities. [

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amess</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister began by telling us that NICE should have been greeted with enthusiasm rather than churlishness. Everyone knows that since 1 May 1997, there has been a complete change in the membership of health authorities. Anyone who is not a Labour party apparatchik has been jettisoned. The new chairman of South Essex health authority, who lives opposite me, had her Labour sticker up during the general election. She now has three of her
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
colleagues from Thurrock on the health authority. It is very unconvincing when the Minister says that 32 or 37 different community health councils support NICE. The Conservative party does not buy that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that new treatments will be spread across the health service, but he gave no details. How will the different people involved in the health service find out about them? It is disgusting that we have only until 6.15 pm to debate this important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ever since 1 May 1997 the Labour Government have disregarded proper scrutiny of the Executive. There is the fiasco of doing everything by statutory instrument. When my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked a technical question, the Minister said that he was not an expert and that the Committee was not the place for it. Exactly—this process is improper and inadequate to discuss an important measure. It is not that the House of Commons is too busy to discuss it. Since 1 May, a legion of people has been elected to the House of Commons who cannot wait to get out of it. We are now working less than we have ever done during the 16 years that I have been a Member. The situation is a disgrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
General practitioners and clinicians are becoming increasingly worried about the Government's interventionist stance on professinal autonomy. My friends who are consultants and doctors at Southend hospital feel humiliated by the Government. The hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) dismissed the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about rationing. Of course, the Labour Party does not want to talk about rationing. That is the rub. I am sick to death of acronyms such as NICE, as if the institute will solve all the problems in the NHS. The general public know that more money must be put into the NHS and yesterday's Budget—the biggest con ever—certainly did not do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must return to the issue under discussion and not talk about yesterday's Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amess</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Cunningham. I was provoked by the way in which the hon. Member for Cannock Chase was looking at me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NICE is an extension into surgery of the role of political decisions. It is likely that general practitioners and clinicians wanting to prescribe drugs or carry out procedures that do not have the approval of NICE will be placed under extreme pressure not to do so, both professionally and financially. It is all about resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the difference between rationing and priorities. My goodness, for 18 years no Labour Member of Parliament wanted to listen to the Conservatives talking about priorities. Labour Members wanted instead to concentrate on Jennifer's ear and so on. Since 1 May, we have been expected to listen to the Labour rubbish that is served up all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Michael Rawlins has already admitted that NICE will be unable to recommend clinically effective drugs or treatments if there are insufficient resources to make them available to patients. Is that not a major part of NICE? If it will be unable to recommend such treatments because there is not enough money, how will that help our constituents? The hon. Member for Cannock Chase referred to Bristol, and rightly so. We are all appalled by what happened there. However, it all comes down to rationing, and it is not clear how NICE will evaluate clinical effectiveness versus efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prodigy system will lead to increased government intervention and may well focus far more on the cost-effectiveness of drugs than on their clinical effectiveness. General practitioners and clinicians must, in most instances, retain the autonomy to prescribe drugs or carry out the procedures that they feel are clinically necessary for the well-being of their patients. NICE is more about controlling expenditure than clinical excellence. If the Minister were honest, he would admit that that is true. NICE is more about political control than patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the statutory instrument is technically incorrect. Article 2 cites the Act as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the National Health Service Act 1997".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman missed an earlier part of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amess</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I missed it, but I was busy deliberating how I should vote on another matter. I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge pointed out that the statutory instrument was incorrect. I am surprised that we are continuing the debate. Perhaps we should reconvene in a few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NICE is being instituted by a statutory instrument, under the National Health Service Act 1977, as a special health authority. That gets round the need to establish it in legislation and means that the Government—in whom I have absolutely no confidence—can much more easily extend their powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society dinner on Monday evening, I heard the Secretary of State accusing me of having leaked what had happened last year when a member of the audience at a function had stood up and said that the speech that the Secretary of State was making was boring. Is it any wonder that the Secretary of State does not want the matter debated on the Floor of the House? He does not have the answers to any of the questions. It is just more Labour soft soap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour does not want a full parliamentary debate on NICE because it would give medical professionals—who are not widely aware of our debate in Committee—the opportunity to draw attention to the Government's covert rationing strategy, of which NICE is a principal organ. The functions of NICE are not properly set out in the statutory instrument—just as with the Health Bill. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Secretary of State is given far too much discretion to interfere in clinical decisions that should be the sole preserve of clinicians. The Government think that they know better than anyone else—and Labour Members are beginning to believe such garbage. Even the free spirits on the Labour Benches have sold out to new Labour and to the rubbish that the Chancellor propounded yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any definition of clinical effectiveness must include a definition of cost-effectiveness, or NICE would be prevented from ruling out effective treatments on the ground of cost. However, as several hon. Members have said, the chairman-designate has already stated that NICE will rule out such expensive treatments. The Government have not made explicit reference to cost-effectiveness in the statutory instrument, thus letting the Labour rationing cat out of the bag.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument is another example of the way in which the Labour party continues to demean and diminish the function of Members of Parliament, regardless of their affiliation—to hold the Executive to account. The statutory instrument is not the way effectively to analyse the practical implications of NICE's creation. Without being unfair to the Minister, I have to say that his explanation of what NICE will deliver to my constituents in Southend, West was extremely unconvincing and disappointing. I am not impressed with the fact that, as we heard from the Health Committee, it will be made up of so-called experts. We want to explore that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course I wish NICE well and hope that the hon. Member for Cannock Chase is right in his expectations, but—as someone who is politically biased—I can say only that since 1 May 1997, I and the overwhelming majority of my constituents have been disappointed by yet another broken promise from the Government. Far from Labour saving the national health service, the Conservatives will have to rescue it when we form the next Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Cunningham, for letting me catch your eye and I am delighted to speak for the first time under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several important issues remain uncovered in our debate. The first is the fact that power is being centralised in the hands of the Secretary of State, which is so typical of the Government in so many areas. Instead of trusting to the clinical excellence of individual GPs and health authority clinicians and allowing them to continue the present practice of drawing up protocols on the basis of clinical need, the whole system is being altered to produce the new institute and to centralise power in the hands of the Secretary of State. If members of the Committee doubt that, they have only to read the statutory instrument to see that the institute will consist of
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) a chairman;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) seven members who are not officers of the Institute"</p></blockquote>
and four members who are officers. In other words, the Government have an in-built majority of five out of eight placemen on NICE, so that the Secretary of State
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
can, in effect, control it. That is against the interests of individual patients. At present, it is mainly clinicians in each health authority who draw up the protocols of what drugs can be prescribed in certain circumstances. Drugs will be prescribed increasingly on the basis of the resources available to the health service, not on clinical need. I do not know why the Minister denies that, because drugs budgets are clearly becoming more limited as resources are more scarce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drugs are becoming more expensive as they are becoming more sophisticated, so it is inevitable that they will become more limited. I do not why anyone bothers denying that. Let us have a completely open system and consider how the matter can be handled effectively to the benefit of everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the information from NICE be disseminated to individual GPs way down the medical chain, particularly in rural areas? Individual GP partnerships in those areas will now be concentrated in primary care groups. The primary care group will come under resources pressure, which will, in turn, put pressure on individual GPs in respect of what drugs they can or cannot prescribe. That would be intolerable because only the GP in the consulting room knows the scale of a patient's illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the information be administered? There has already been a Public Accounts Committee hearing into the disaster of the Read code system—the computer system that disseminates information from the NHS to individual hospitals, to the doctors and back again to the institute on the basis of patient need. When will the new Prodigy system come into operation? Will it be ready to transfer the information electronically?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How, under the new NICE system, will the needs of one expensive drug be balanced against another expensive drug? Various drugs have been mentioned, but how will different classes of drugs be prescribed for different diseases? Let us suppose that a woman with ovarian cancer needs Taxol and the individual health authority is not allowed to prescribe it because NICE says that it cannot be prescribed under its clinical conditions. That woman will be in a dire situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the guidelines be circulated to the different levels within the NHS? Apparently, Viagra can be prescribed by hospital consultants, but not individual
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
GPs. How will NICE differentiate between the primary care system, the secondary care system and the specialist care system within the health service? In different circumstances, the same drug may be prescribed, but we must know how such arrangements will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the system has been welcomed widely by the royal colleges and others, we have not been told how the information will be distributed. Drugs budgets are becoming more scarce. In individual health authorities, such as mine, resources are being taken away by the Government who have gerrymandered the formula to remove the weighting given to the elderly. My constituency has a high percentage of elderly patients who will need more drugs and it is distressing that the Government are giving less resources to the Gloucestershire health authority because it has reduced the weighting for the elderly. That is not acceptable to my constitutents. It is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the 18 years of the Conservative Government, equal resources were given to patients on equal need. To drain resources from one rural health authority—the Minister laughs. I am sure that my constituents will be interested that the Minister is laughing while taking away resources from their health authority. It is not acceptable. Each patient should be given equal resources on equal need. That is what we did throughout the 18 years of the Conservative Government and it is not happening now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
