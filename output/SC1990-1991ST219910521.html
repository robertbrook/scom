	<div class='legislation'>Draft Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 (Schedule 3 Amendment) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Maclean)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, the Committee has considered the Draft Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 (Schedule 3 Amendment) Order 1991.</p></blockquote>
The draft order will amend schedule 3 to the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966, and will have the effect of, first, enabling veterinary nurses to administer, at the direction of a registered veterinary surgeon, any medical treatment or any minor surgery that does not involve entry into a body cavity to companion animals, excluding horses. Secondly, it will prohibit any unqualified persons from docking the tails of dogs with effect from July 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should stress that the draft order deals solely with those points, and it is merely a coincidence that we are debating a measure that will improve the welfare of dogs, at a time when the welfare of humans in relation to dogs is a cause of great concern. I know that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is extremely worried about the problem of dangerous dogs, and is considering possible measures. Nevertheless, it is vital that we regard those issues as entirely separate, and that we deal solely with the specific issues before us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Page committee, in its review of veterinary manpower and education published last year, recommended extending the role of veterinary nurses to include tasks currently confined to qualified veterinary surgeons. The Government have accordingly consulted interested parties on the scope for reducing the legal restrictions on procedures that veterinary nurses may carry out on animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All interests, including the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the British Veterinary Nursing Association, and the British Veterinary Association have agreed that veterinary nurses should be permitted to carry out a wider range of tasks than hitherto, provided that they are under the direction of the employing veterinary surgeon—although not necessarily in his or her presence. Those organisations agreed that it would be best not to attempt to prescribe a full list of such tasks. Instead, a more flexible approach is proposed, to allow veterinary nurses to administer to companion—that is, pet—animals any medical treatment or minor surgery that does not involve entry into a body cavity, provided that the task is performed under the direction of a registered veterinary surgeon who is responsible for the nurse. The definition of "companion animal" excludes farm animals and equine animals as it is considered that most
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
veterinary nurses are not adequately trained to treat such animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the docking of a dog's tail can be carried out by anyone aged 18 or over, provided that it is done before the dog's eyes are open. The amending order removes that entitlement. When the order comes into force in two years' time only registered veterinary surgeons will be able to operate to remove a dog's tail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken that step after considerable thought and for several reasons, which together convinced me that the routine mutilation of dogs in that way has become an anachronism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10 of the Council of Europe convention on pet animals, includes a proposal that member states should prohibit routine docking of dogs' tails for cosmetic reasons. Although a reservation on tail docking may be entered, only four of the 11 countries that signed the convention have chosen to do so. As part of the consultation process in connection with that convention, Home Office Ministers with responsibility for animals held several meetings with interested bodies, including the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the Kennel Club, and the Council of Docked Breeds. Following those meetings and further consultation by my Department, Ministers concluded that steps should be taken to phase out tail docking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The routine docking of dogs' tails has been opposed consistently and with patience by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and the British Veterinary Association for many years. The profession has been supported in that by animal welfare bodies such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The veterinary profession is unanimous that tail docking is a mutilation that is cosmetic, and serves no useful purpose—and the Government entirely agree. The profession believes that there is no clinical justification for the pain that is invariably caused by docking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government agree that it is no longer justified to cut off a dog's tail solely to produce a dog that has nothing left but a tail stump. As one of the few members of the House who has attended a guard dog handling course, and has a certificate to prove that he can handle an alsatian, when I am approached by a strange dog, I always look at the rear end to determine the dog's state of mind—and I ignore any noise coming from the front. All dogs bark, but they express their happiness, fear, or anger through their tails. A tail is a vital part of a dog's personality in my opinion, and cutting off a dog's tail is like cutting off a politician's hands,—we would not be able to communicate effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered carefully whether it is necessary for any dogs to have their tails removed routinely and we have received no persuasive arguments. For instance, it is sometimes claimed that certain breeds of shooting dog need to be docked because it can be kinder to the dog to remove its tail soon after birth, as that will protect it from damage. But we have evidence that even of the breeds that work in close cover, there are some that are not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
docked and do not suffer tail damage. In many cases, difficulty with the tail can often be overcome merely by clipping the hair. My retriever copying my springer spaniel, which has the dominant personality, ploughs through bramble thickets that he ought not to, but has never suffered any tail damage—although I do have to remove half a forest from his tail at night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My springer insists on going through undergrowth that other dogs will not touch. At night after his bath, I sit with the tweezers and remove thorns and brambles from his head, front legs and belly, and barrow-loads of twigs and burrs from his ears, but he has never suffered the slightest damage to his tail or rear end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the order will remove the current exemption in the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966. It will prevent the removal of a dog's tail except where, in a veterinary surgeon's opinion, that is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister knows of the particular interest that I have in animal rights. He makes a persuasive case of the order, and I am sure that the Committee is grateful to him. Can he clarify my understanding that it will be two years before the order can be implemented? If that is correct, will my hon. Friend comment on why it will take that long before the thoroughly obnoxious practice of docking can be curtailed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises a good point. The order will come into effect in two years' time, which will give breeders ample time to phase out tail docking, and will allow undocked dogs to be displayed alongside docked dogs at dog shows for some time. That will allow public attitudes time to change. Once the public sees that terriers, dobermann pinschers, bulldogs, spaniels—yes, and even rottweilers—are born with tails as God gave them, I believe that there will be a rapid demand to stop mutilating dogs, and to leave them as nature intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not rushed into that decision. We held discussions with the veterinary and welfare associations and the breed societies, and we are giving a further two years' notice. But I make an appeal to all those who breed dogs and who draw up so-called standards for them. First, I hope that they will make rapid progress in drawing up new standards for dogs with tails, and that they will take the opportunity to devise a standard that incorporates the historical working characteristics of dogs—particularly in the gun dog categories—rather than some of the designer dogs that we have seen in recent years, which have had all their working abilities bred out of them. Secondly, I hope that we will not see the mass production of puppies with tails just to meet new demand. The overbreeding of dogs grieves me greatly, and I hope that they will not end up on the export market and be sent to countries where the utterly despicable practice of cutting off their ears goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Member for Fareham (Mr. Lloyd). I am honoured to introduce the order, because the subject it concerns
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
is one in which I have been interested since I became a Member of Parliament eight years ago—but were not for the keen personal interest taken in the matter by my hon. Friend, I would not have had the chance to present this measure. I am confident that the order will receive widespread public support. More important than that, I am sure that, in years to come, many tails will be wagged in gratitude to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Parliamentary Secretary referred to his training as a dog handler, I thought that he would justify why he is called a "rottweiler Minister". However, he did not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome article 2(c), which deals with the prohibition of the docking of dogs' tails. As the Minister dealt with several of the issues that I intended to raise, he has curtailed the need for me to do so. His speech went into greater depth than the wording of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party is strongly opposed to the docking of dogs' tails for cosmetic and breeding purposes. It should be permitted only if the practice is absolutely necessary on medical grounds. However, although we do not disagree with the Government about tail docking, I was a little disappointed with the Parliamentary Secretary's answer to the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls), who queried the date on which the provision will be implemented—but I understand the reason behind the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we shall not press the matter to a Division, we believe that if it is acknowledged that tail docking is not right, it should be stopped sooner than two years. There is no justification for a phasing-in period, or for allowing dogs with docked tails to be on sale alongside dogs with undocked tails. I regret the Government choice of date to implement the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will use all his powers of persuasion to influence people to accelerate the timetable. Perhaps it will soon be the case that dogs' tails are left undocked by choice, and that people will end the practice not simply to comply with legislative requirements. The Minister argued along those lines, when he said that he wanted rapid progress made in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise the common sence of allowing qualified veterinary nurses to carry out certain medical treatment, and we accept the altered wording to define what treatment is permitted. As comparable provisions exist for the treatment of human beings, we should not impose tighter regulations or different standards in respect of companion animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we suffer minor medical problems, we often accept treatment from a qualified nurse, under instructions from a doctor, without that doctor necessarily having to be present. It does not seem unreasonable to extend that practice to the animals referred to in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the measure will not apply to equines or farm animals because greater skill is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
needed to deal with them. A veterinary nurse capable of dealing with small animals may not be able to cope with larger animals. There is obviously a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said on several occasions that, given the increased demands for qualified vets to meet the requirements of United Kingdom and new EC legislation, this country is facing a shortage of them. I hope that the main purpose of the measure is not to overcome that problem. Perhaps the Minister will reassure us that the Government recognise the need for more qualified vets. We believe that the Government are, to some extent, responsible for the current shortage, and that the problem will be even greater in a few years' time. It should be tackled now, and I hope that the Minister will say that the Government accept that there is an increased demand for vets. Qualified veterinarians should be able to carry out the wide range of duties and impositions that will be placed on them. We do not object to the principles contained in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I associate myself with the Minister's comments about dangerous dogs. That aspect is not covered by the order, and we await tomorrow's statement. Conservative and Opposition Members are unanimous that steps must be taken to ensure that the public are protected from such animals. After all, the dogs are not to blame. Dog owners must carry responsibility for the actions of their pets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pike</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall support the right moves to deal with that matter at the appropriate time. However, we do not wish to enter into that wider debate today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnor)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not imagine that the Government intended to vet-cap. There has been broad recognition of the need for more vets since the saving of Glasgow and Cambridge veterinary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of my party, I welcome the order. Vets are busy people, and they are under tremendous pressure. Veterinary nurses especially have an important role to play. They gain experience in surgeries, and often become vets in their own right. We welcome the fact that the order will enable them to perform minor surgery on pets. That will relieve the pressure on vets, give nurses valuable experience, and speed the healing of injuries to small pets—which is important from the point of view of animal welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk a great deal about dogs in Britain. I know that you, Mr. Howells, had a well-loved dog called Cymro, whose tail did not need to be docked. Your dog worked well on the slopes of Plynlimon, as do many sheepdogs on the hills of Wales, Scotland, and in the west and north of England. Many breeds manage perfectly well without their tails being docked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask the Minister a question about gun dogs. He mentioned springer spaniels, and said that the Kennel Club and some breed societies had been consulted. However, he did not say what their response had been. Does the Kennel Club agree that the banning of tail docking is a move forward?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
What does the English Springer Spaniel Club think about the tails of its breeds not being docked, given that spaniels are used to going through extremely deep thickets? It was once conventional to regard it as essential to dock springer spaniels' tails, although I have never been convinced of the need to do so. I wonder what are the current views of some of the spaniel societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome all the measures. They are right, but I regret that they cannot be implemented within two years. They should be implemented as soon as possible. I welcome the fact that the Home Secretary will make a statement tomorrow about dangerous dogs. There is a strong case for banning some breeds, and it should be remembered that not only owners, but those who breed such dogs must take responsibility. A pit bull terrier has been bred to fight other pit bull terriers, which is a nasty breeding programme. That unethical practice should be examined in its own right. I hope that the order will reach the statute book as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.52 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for Burnley (Mr. Pike) and for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Livsey) for their warm support of this small but important measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that we need increased veterinary manpower. The Page committee's recommendation was accepted by the Government, and we are funding places for more vets in the future. Training a vet is a long process, and we shall do nothing to diminish the standard and quality of veterinary education. While allowing veterinary nurses to do simple tasks is necessary and right, they are not substitute for fully qualified vets. There is no suggestion that we shall use nurses on the cheap to do the vet's job. The vets are happy, as is the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, the British Veterinary Association, and the nurses themselves—who are keen to do the simple tasks, that other nurses perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor asked about the views of the Kennel Club, and others. The Kennel Club believes that shows should allow both docked and undocked dogs to be exhibited but we take a different view and want docking to stop. The English Springer Spaniel Club was not consulted specifically, but the council for docked breeds was. The Shooting Times and Country Magazine has a perpetual debate running on the matter, and every week a different view is advanced. Much is rested in folk lore. I have seen many springers with long tails and with shorter tails, and I am convinced that whatever other damage those dogs may suffer as they fight their way through brambles as they energetically raise birds, their tails are the least of their worries. I should have thought that if anything risked being damaged, it would be their lugs, because they collect every bit of bramble, bracken and gorse heather in sight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard of dogs' tails being damaged, but only when they were snapped at by another dog, or when there was a tumour in the tail that had nothing to do with its length or with the excessive wagging that is characteristic of spaniels. I share entirely the view of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
the hon. Member for Burnley that it is dog owners rather than the breeds that are the problem. Pit bull terriers are bred for nasty, vicious, and morally wrong practices. They have an instinct to fight that is highly undesirable, but I never like to place the blame on the dogs when it is usually the owner or handler who is responsible. From the nicest little pet dog through to the most vicious dog, the owner is usually responsible. I shall not go so far as to say that there are no bad dogs and only bad owners, but that must be largely true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Burnley referred to the timing of the order's implementation. All of us would love this measure to have been introduced yesterday, but the Committee must think what would happen to all those who are currently breeding dogs, some of which may have a high value. I do not want to see hundreds of dogs dumped on to the pet market—or, even worse, dumped on the streets—because of a sudden change in the market.

Unfortunately, too many people like to buy designer dogs or to own the dog that is the in thing. If, often we make that change, it becomes the in thing to have a dog with a tail, I know that many owners will get rid of, or dump, dogs without tails. Unscrupulous dealers, illegal breeders, or puppy farms may do the same.

I do not want that to happen because it would be bad for dogs. Dumping them on the streets would be even worse than tail docking. We stipulated a two-year period in the hope that maximum publicity will be given to the change—that the public will come to

realise that there is nothing wrong with undocked tails—and that if people own a dog with a tail, they should keep it, and take care of it for the rest of its life, rather than trade it in for a new model.

We must hammer that point home in schools and colleges. I hope that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other animal welfare organisations will make that clear. I cannot stand the idea of someone getting rid of a dog without a tail because they want a designer dog that has one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not disagree. We understand the case for implementing the order in 1993, although we would have liked an earlier date. We hope that publicity will encourage a quicker change. We do not want dogs with docked tails to be ditched. They have the right to a normal life. It is not their fault if their tails have been docked, and we would not wish them to be cast aside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The order has been warmly received on all sides. It is a good welfare order, which I am privileged to place before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
