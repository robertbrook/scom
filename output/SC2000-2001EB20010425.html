	<p>[
	<i>Relevant Document: European Community Document No. 11529/00.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission communication on a community immigration policy is designed to launch a wide debate on what a common EU policy should look like. Some of the thinking behind the communication echoes the debate already being held in member states, including the United Kingdom, on the need for a more positive approach to migration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my speech entitled "UK Migration in a Global Economy", which I delivered at the Institute for Public Policy Research conference last September, I raised the need to look at both the benefits and the challenges of managing modern migration, and I spoke about beginning a wider debate on what a modern migration policy should look like. Further discussion at European level would be helpful. The development of more positive policies on economic migration can help to tackle the predicted demographic decline in some member states and growing skills shortages in the UK. Those policies could from part of an overall migration framework in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Orderly migration could bring a number of benefits to the EU, to the migrants themselves and to their countries of origin, and reduce the number of economic migrants entering the EU, either illegally or through the asylum procedures. In line with conclusions from the Tampere meeting of the European Council, the Commission's aim is to establish an overall framework for migration at EU level. It proposes common standards and procedures as well as a mechanism for setting objectives and targets. Member states would develop and implement national plans within that framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission communication covers four distinct issues: developing a common policy; economic migration; fair treatment of third country nationals; and management of migration, focusing primarily on illegal migration. The Government have welcomed the communication as a first response to the call by the European Council at Tampere in October 1999 for a common EU immigration policy. We also support the proposition that immigration policies must be transparent, rational and flexible. The UK retains the right, under its protocol to the treaty establishing the European Community, not to participate in such measures, and Government policy is to retain control of our immigration policy. We would not agree to
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
measures that would undermine the integrity of our frontier controls. However, that does not mean that the UK's immigration policies need be seriously at odds with those of the member states participating in such measures. The UK Government intend to be active participants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's formally stated aim for immigration explicitly recognises
	<br><blockquote><p>"the regulation of entry to and settlement in the United Kingdom in the interests of social stability and economic growth."</p></blockquote>
The recently published Home Office research makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the impact of migration policies. One of its key findings was that migration is likely to be beneficial in economic and social terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is less demographic pressure on the UK than on much of the rest of the EU, but we face a decrease in the proportion of our working age population relative to those in retirement. Migration can help to alleviate that by encouraging people from abroad to take employment in the UK, but it is only part of the solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other measures aimed at improving skills through education and training and increasing labour market participation rates and productivity are vital. Migration complements those labour market policies and is not a substitute for them. However, the efforts that the Government are putting into training the existing population will take time to feed through into increased skill levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, we face an immediate problem as demographic pressures on the UK and Europe start to bite. Employers in some sectors are clamouring for labour from abroad, and the UK is competing with other countries for skilled people. A positive approach to managed migration can help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Office report also stated that we need more research into the congestion and regeneration effects of migration, the impact on different social groups in the UK, the social contribution made by migrants, and the implications of migration for source countries. The Government recognise the important role that migration has throughout the EU, and we are commissioning more research to inform our policy decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government enthusiastically support the principle of fair treatment for third country nationals, which is fundamental to successful integration. We support measures to ensure that the rights of long-term legally resident third country nationals are broadly comparable to those of member states' nationals. The Tampere Council qualified the rights of third country nationals as rights in member states of residence. The Government would have serious difficulty with proposals that granted rights of residence for such persons in other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government support the Commission's proposal that admission policies should be counterbalanced with a firm approach to illegal migration, especially in relation to the smuggling and trafficking of human beings. We have implemented a range of measures in the UK to tackle the problem of illegal immigration, one of the most effective of which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
was the introduction of a civil penalty for smuggling people in road haulage vehicles. We are working closely with the French Government in examining improving security at Calais and Coquelles and controlling the number of inadequately documented passengers arriving at Waterloo and Ashford on Eurostar trains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the UK, all operational activity targeted against serious and organised criminal involvement in illegal immigration is now co-ordinated through the interagency group Project Reflex. We have led the way in Europe in working with other member states for a co-ordinated European response to people trafficking and smuggling. I hope that that is a helpful overview of the Government's position on the communication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that questions should be asked singly. If that is done, I suspect that we shall have more than enough time to ensure that all hon. Members are accommodated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lidington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister about the treaty basis for the common immigration policy. This morning, the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union published a report on community immigration policy, paragraph 172 of which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's ability to maintain the United Kingdom's independent admission policy will depend on preserving the integrity of Title IV. We doubt whether this will be feasible in the long term."</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister agree that the Government's ability to preserve our independent admissions policy will be undermined over the medium to long term? If she disagrees with that conclusion, will she explain why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the great pleasure of giving evidence to that Committee in another place. It is a distinguished Committee that includes a wide range of opinions, and the Government will study its report closely. I was asked that question by their Lordships. We are strongly committed to maintaining the opt-out secured at Amsterdam. We are wedded to it. We will consider any measures that might be proposed as a result of the communication, but we reserve the right to decide whether to opt in. Our primary consideration is the maintenance of our border controls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kelvin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Government's position and my hon. Friend's remarks. Does she agree that the European Union is not yet economically and socially homogeneous, and that that might never be achieved, as there are significant differences between its member states. Great Britain should maintain its own immigration policies given, for example, its distinctive labour market and birth rate. It is appropriate, for the foreseeable future at least, to retain the policies that she has outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks. The communication has many positive aspects. It is a thoughtful document, and the Government support its thrust. It is intended not to set policy but to promote debate. Indeed, I have called for
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
a debate about the subject. It would be useful to discuss such matters in a European context, because some questions that are current in the United Kingdom are also current in other EU member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend's comments about different traditions and systems. To respond to the remarks of the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), and to repeat what I said to their Lordships, because of the UK's unique history and geography, it takes a distinctive position with regard to border controls, which is why we strongly believe that that is an imperative matter. However, as our policies should not be seriously out of line with those of the rest of the EU, we also take a close interest in debates about such issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister about the basis of the treaty. Will she confirm that there is disagreement between the UK and the Commission about the interpretation of the treaty, with regard to services that can be provided to third country nationals? If that is the case, does it not illustrate that, post-Amsterdam, the distinction between the aspects of immigration policy that fall within Community competence, and those that fall within the competence of member states, is far from clear-cut? The matter might have to be resolved by the European Court of Justice. What is the current situation with regard to that disagreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government take a firm view on that issue. Matters that involve the status of third party nationals are intimately bound up with the opt-out that the Prime Minister secured at Amsterdam. Our position is clear-cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the welcome development of a Community immigration policy would benefit the UK, even though it has not fully signed up to the Schengen agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. The communication is not intended to create a firm framework of detailed measures—although, if measures were proposed, we would consider them. One of its aims is to stimulate the debate on migration, and it has achieved that. What is important, especially in the current debate, is to separate migration from asylum. I had the pleasure of listening to Lady Harris on the "Today" programme this morning, who said that the two had become muddled. It is interesting that the document specifies migration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend that we are not inhibited from taking part in the discussion by our position on training, and we very much want to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving slightly late, Mr. Gale. I was delayed because I was responding to the latest asylum figures, which came out at 9.30 this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister three questions. I agree with her that it is important to separate asylum and immigration, as my colleague Lady Harris said earlier
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
on the radio. First, it is sensible to have a European-wide approach to policy, which should be nondiscriminatory in respect of the origin of the applicant for immigration into the EU and into the United Kingdom, and of his or her qualifications or competence. The Minister said that we have skills shortages, but there is a danger in saying, "Yes, we are happy to have an immigration policy with fixed numbers of immigrants," and announcing in advance how many there should be, but then saying that we will take only people who have further or higher education qualifications or those with particular skills. That would mean taking into our economy well-skilled people whose countries may need their skills, and not taking those whom we might be able to train, with a view to their returning home with skills that would help their countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrats would have a mixed, comprehensive school-type immigration policy, which would take a mixed ability range of immigrants. Those who had low academic qualifications but good manual skills would be equally likely to be able to come here, which would ensure that the United Kingdom did not take the cream of the developed world, leaving poorer countries to train people on whom they would have to spend much more money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate the reason for the hon. Gentleman's arriving late, but because he did so he did not hear my admonition that questions should be asked one at a time. I have imposed that restriction on every hon. Member who has spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises some interesting points. I am on record as having said that I firmly believe that immigration laws must be nondiscriminatory on grounds of race. I feel slightly pompous for referring to my past speeches on the subject, but in my IPPR speech I was critical of legislation passed by previous Governments, both Labour and Conservative. Immigration policy should not be based on race.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question whether immigrants should be skilled or unskilled is interesting. All countries are entitled to act in their own best interests, and countries clearly want the best and the brightest people. The most obvious recent example is that of the German Government, who are trying to recruit information technology specialists, especially from India. They have found it difficult because the people whom they are trying to recruit are so highly skilled, and thus so highly sought after, that it is a sellers' market. The specialists can go anywhere in the world because many countries, including the United Kingdom, want them. I am ambitious for the UK to get the best that we can. However, the Government's position is that it depends on what employers want. In my September speech, I called for a debate among employers to tell us what we need. Clearly, there are skill shortages in some areas, such as IT, but there have also been pressures in agriculture. People must make a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal briefly with the important point that the hon. Gentleman made about developing countries and whether we are poaching people from
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
them. This is a complex argument. Indeed, the report on migration produced by the Home Office research unit and published in January called for more work to be done on the subject. There are some mixed arguments. The Canadian Government have done quite a lot of research showing that the remittances that migrants send back to their families in their source countries and the network effect tend to outweigh the difficulties. Different developing countries have diverse views on this, so clearly much more research is needed. I agree that when we rightly look to our own interests, we should also act in a way that is compatible with our partnership with developing countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw the Minister's attention to page 12 of the document and the reference to the Commission's intention to introduce
	<br><blockquote><p>"proposals for the development of common standards for expulsion decisions, detention and deportation"?</p></blockquote>
Will those be legislative proposals that would be binding on member states? In principle, is this an area of European policy that the Government would be happy to opt into?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said before, we examine any proposals carefully and make a decision on whether they would be in the UK's interests. Our primary consideration is always whether they are compatible with the retention of our border controls, and we make our decisions accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like follow on from the Minister's helpful answer and to consider the example of where people with low skills might well be needed and for whom a time spent here might be beneficial, such as hospital cleaners who are hard to find at present. Will she ensure that the policy is formulated and agreed in conjunction with our Commonwealth partners so that they can be happy that we are not proceeding in a way that suggests that this is a fortress Europe, a white man's club or a powerful countries' policy imposed on less powerful countries? Will the agreement of other international forums within the UN and elsewhere also be sought?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the process of application to come to the UK be facilitated at the same time? People should be able to obtain proper advice and assistance in the country of origin. Someone might want to leave Sri Lanka because he was unhappy about the politics, but he might also be keen to come for economic reasons. It might be helpful if a representative of the UK Government, the high commission or another EU state mission was there to process that application so that it could be made on the basis of the best case for the individual. Three cases are set out in the document, involving humanitarian, family reunion and economic migration grounds. People also apply on an asylum basis. Has the Minister considered a way in which to ensure that applications to come to this country are made in the home country through a process that ensures that the applicant receives guidance and is given the best opportunity to succeed in his application?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, we already have that system. Through its consular posts throughout the world, the Foreign Office administers entry clearance. The hon. Gentleman will know from not only his Opposition Front-Bench position but his constituency casework that more money has been put into the entry clearance procedure, part of which is for the provision of information, including publishing pamphlets and a video. A joint entry clearance unit is also being set up to discuss such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Immigration Act 1971, about 60,000 people each year have settled legally in the United Kingdom either through joining a spouse or work permit-related methods. We must consider first how the changes that we have made to the work permit system have bedded down. My colleagues in the Department for Education and Employment have made the work permit system more employer-friendly and much easier to administer. They have enabled it to deal with some of the shortages that have been experienced in certain sectors. In answer to the hon. Gentleman's first point, our policies are clear and transparent. Giving people information about how such policies operate is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When does the Minister expect the European Union to reach agreement on the Community policy? How long will it take to implement it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to say, because what is before us today is a communication. Measures may come from it. I have an inkling that most member states will want their own objectives, perhaps within a Community framework. They will look closely at any particular measures that come through. I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful. I do not regard the policy as all-embracing. I expect that, in the next year or so, individual measures will be introduced on which the United Kingdom Government will take a view. I assure my hon. Friend that the biggest movement is that, at last, we are discussing the matter at a European Union-wide level. In Marseilles last summer, it was the subject of a great deal of discussion by Justice and Home Affairs Ministers. I welcome that as a proper step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But did not the Heads of Government commit themselves at both Vienna and Tampere to a timetable that stated that a common European immigration policy would be in effect within five years of the treaty of Amsterdam coming into force? That would mean that the measures would have to be in place by about the middle of 2004. Do the Government believe that such a time scale is desirable and practical?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before that can happen, other measures may have to be introduced. In my experience as a Minister representing the United Kingdom, such matters take time. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we secured our own border controls, so we can decide on immigration and asylum matters and whether to opt in. We watched progress with a great deal of interest. We will participate in all the discussions and then
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
make our views known. Several asylum measures are currently being discussed, and they are clearly occupying a great deal of the Council's time, so it is not possible to be absolutely precise about the timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the Minister's advice and best estimates across Government of assessments of numbers—and in relation to some of the questions arising from the Select Committee's report—will she confirm that, until about seven or eight years ago, we had a net emigration, but in the past seven years, we have had, almost every year, a small net immigration? Is the current advice to Government that, without some action being taken, that trend is likely to remain the same? Do the Government have an up-to-date figure—both for the UK and as a result of sharing information with other EU member states—on the number of people needed in the work force, because of a lack of skills, in the UK and across the EU? Are they working on the basis of a ball-park figure, which could inform this debate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have the Government concluded whether it is equally appropriate to grant both limited immigration, as in the work permit system—at least in the first place—and indefinite, unlimited immigration, as part of future policy development? That would create two categories—people who would apply and be entitled to stay without restriction, irrespective of nationality, from the beginning, and people who would apply but be given permission only for a fixed term, after which the matter would be open for reconsideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that, over the past few years, the figures have shifted slightly. I do not have up-to-date information on the matter, but I shall write to him and other members of the Committee about it. On the UK and the European Union, demographic imperatives apply, and the UK is not as badly affected as some other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with the skills shortage, we would emphasise the need to invest in the skills and training of people who are currently resident here. Clearly, that has been one of the main policies and manifesto objectives of the Government. We must also have a grown-up debate about what we need, which is part of what I called for in September. That would not only involve those of us who are interested in home affairs issues but business, trade unions and others. It is not simply a question of skills shortages, and the problem must be looked at in the round. Migration is certainly one of the factors that contribute to demographic change, but it is not the only one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On work permits, the UK tradition—of which I am proud, because it is better than that of many other countries—is that if one has had four years of continuous work permit employment, one can apply for indefinite leave to remain. After one has been given indefinite leave to remain, and if one fulfils the requirements, one can then apply for British citizenship. We have always had a tradition, unlike some other European Union countries, of welcoming settlement on that basis, and that is very good. Some countries do things differently, and we should look
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
beyond the European Union at traditional countries of migration, such as the United States, Canada and Australia. Some of those countries have done interesting things, and we should look at them as part of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not making any proposals, apart from the changes that have already been made to the work permit scheme and the innovators scheme, which seems to be creating highly skilled jobs. We shall examine how such schemes bed down and stimulate public debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pick up on the Minister's point about the need to invest in the skills of people who are here already. That clearly would not include people who have arrived illegally and have gone into employment, often in dreadful conditions. Will she confirm that she is familiar with the estimate of the number of illegal immigrants throughout the European Union per year, which has risen from about 40,000 in 1993 to 500,000 last year? In the context of the development of the common immigration policy, has there been discussion about how to deal with illegal immigrants who are present in all our countries, or is it expected that each country will deal with such people in an individual manner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I am aware of his work as Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, especially in respect of the report on border controls. This is a complex problem, and the welcome factor about the Commission communication is that it recognises that member states must deal with and deter illegal immigration, in terms of both individual action and collective work. Member states' laws are being broken, and criminal gangs are making huge amounts from smuggling and trafficking people. That is a terrible trade, and we must do all that we can to combat it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are measures that we can implement alone, but some of the most important measures are those that involve working with our European Union partners, such as the recent initiative that we led to tackle the trafficking and smuggling problem in the western Balkans. That is important, and involves the sharing of intelligence and information, and the posting of liaison officers. It is not an easy area, and we must ensure that all European Union countries redouble their efforts on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the motion, the Government declare their intention that British immigration policy should not be dissimilar from the policies of other European Union countries. Does that view extend to looking towards the approximation of our internal immigration controls, so that they resemble controls employed by continental countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. All that we say in the motion is that we should ensure that the UK's immigration policies are "broadly in line" with those of other member states. However, if we disagree with a policy, it will not be broadly in line. We shall make a decision depending on the policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Gerrard 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Walthamstow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the rights of third country nationals, and particularly long-term residents. The Commission's view is that for such people the right of abode in one member state can be transferred to another—a factor in labour mobility within the EU. What are the reasons for the Government's reservations about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that we have some reservations. The key conclusion of the heads of Government at Tampere was—rightly, in our view— that rights should be accorded to third country nationals legally resident in member states. That is what it was all about. It is a jump, however, to say that they should therefore be accorded rights of residence in other member states, which is a matter for national Governments to determine on the basis of their own immigration laws and policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know that the Home Affairs Committee called on the Government to examine the possibility of entitlement cards for people coming into the country. She will also know that the Information Commissioner recently stated that the performance and innovation unit was looking into providing some form of smart card. Will she confirm that those proposals are under active consideration by the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of incurring the wrath of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett), I can say that we found the arguments interesting, but were not persuaded. The issue has much to do with the different ways in which other European countries and this country deal with these matters. We do not all have a system of identity cards and internal checks. We have our own geographically separate and defined border controls, so we take a different view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that, in response to the Home Affairs Committee report on border controls, the Government accepted that it would be wholly inappropriate to introduce identity cards into the United Kingdom? Some European states widely use such documents, and holders can be stopped by the police and made to produce their card at any time. Are the Government still opposed to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But may I press the Minister further? In her response a few moments ago, she referred to the Select Committee proposal, but not to the studies carried out by the performance and innovation unit. Is the PIU considering the use of the smart card, not as a form of identity card to which criminal penalties are attached, but as a form of modern, smart entitlement document, which can be used for some functions that the Select Committee identified as potentially useful for immigration control?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend brought me back to that point and I am happy to confirm it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government share the analysis of the Commission communication that Britain and other western European countries must find ways of allowing more people to migrate here because they possess skills that our economy demands? The suggestion is that far more people than in recent years should be allowed in on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in September, we need a debate that we have not had before in the UK on defining our migration needs. Some strong arguments have been advanced, for example by the business community, for managed migration to fulfil certain labour shortages. That is one of the reasons why we reformed the work permit system and made it much more user-friendly. I have alluded to the demographic pressures. We live in an age when not only capital but labour is mobile and we are in a competitive market for people with high levels of skills that they wish to use abroad. The analysis in the Home Affairs Committee report is, like the Committee itself, extremely thoughtful, and it contributes greatly to the debate. The Government want the business community and others to engage in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page 16 of the communication, the Commission suggests that member states should adopt a system of indicative targets for economic migration. Are the Government happy with that in principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission says that there should be no EU targets. We agree that what member states do is entirely up to them. Although the Commission spoke about indicative targets, it did not flesh that out to any extent. It will be interesting to see what they are. I know of targets in only one area: our seasonal agricultural workers scheme, which we recently extended, in line with what important bodies such as the National Farmers Union were pressing for. That is not primarily an employment scheme but gives young people the opportunity for work experience and cultural exchange. We do not have a tradition of numbers or targets. There are no numbers attached to the work permit scheme, for example. Other countries, such as Canada, have quotas or targets. One could examine that issue in the wide debate that I have called for, but it has not been part of our experience in the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In their thinking on the development of policy, do the Government see the right of British citizens to have spouses, fiancées and dependent relatives join them in this country as something that is not for negotiation? Would economic migration be in addition to people who have come here lawfully for
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
family reasons or are the Government prepared to reconsider the right of British citizens to have their families join them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure to what the hon. Gentleman is referring. Not only British citizens but those who are legally settled here have the right to apply to have spouses join them. They need to comply with the current rules, under which they must satisfy tests that their marriage is valid and conform to the maintenance and accommodation tests. There is no intention to alter that in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can rephrase my question to make it clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been argued in some quarters—not by me— that we should replace the system whereby most immigration settlement consists of family members with a system that considers the economic benefit that a potential immigrant could bring to this country; and that the rights that citizens now have, subject to the tests that the Minister described, should not have such an important place in the immigration system. Do the Government believe that allowing families to come here is core to our system and not open for negotiation, or are they prepared to examine whether that system might be replaced by one based on the economic benefit that could accrue to this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that that issue is completely separate from our debate on immigration today. I hope that that assists him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the driving forces behind the Commission's paper is its view of the labour market in the EU. How will that labour market be affected by the eastward expansion of the EU? My hon. Friend the Member for Erdington spoke about illegal immigration. Some of it originates in states that will fairly shortly become EU members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. Enlargement and the labour force changes that are taking place within the EU add to the complexity of the debate. I apologise to the Committee for coming back to this again and again: we need a grown-up debate about the issue, conducted on the basis of proper research. That is what we call for. The issue that he raised is very much part of the equation and something that we must bear in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a proposal on page 17 of the communication that European legislation should provide for a
	<br><blockquote><p>"flexible overall scheme based on a limited number of statuses".</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister agree that that proposal implies the imposition of a European legislative framework for rights of entry and residence on individual member states, which presumably would override any national arrangements that are currently in place? What is the Government's attitude to that proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the opt-out, we are in the happy position of being able to decide whether to opt into proposals. The proposal mentioned by the hon. Gentleman is at such a green stage that it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
difficult to evaluate its significance, but we will examine any proposal or draft directive that emerges. Once again, I assure him that our overwhelming priority and objective is to retain control of our borders and immigration policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document contains several references to the charter of fundamental rights. To me, the most important is on page 19. It states that the charter
	<br><blockquote><p>"could provide a reference for the development of the concept of civic citizenship in a particular Member State".</p></blockquote>
What do the Government think that that means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. As I told the House of Lords, we are not quite sure what it means; we are seeking clarification. It may be that the Commission regards it as a milestone on the way to citizenship. The United Kingdom's experience is that if someone qualifies for indefinite leave to remain and is thinking about citizenship, that should be encouraged. A key issue that I have no more than floated is that we should celebrate the acquisition of British citizenship more. Achieving citizenship is regarded as an important occasion in the United States or Canada, whereas in the United Kingdom, a piece of paper arrives through the post. However, the question of celebrating the acquisition of citizenship is at a very green stage and is open for debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the need for any reference to the charter of fundamental rights if that charter simply declares rights that already exist by virtue of the European convention on human rights and domestic legislation? Why should the charter of fundamental rights be involved in any concept of citizenship, or in legislation to provide for citizenship? Why not rest on what we already have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. However, I am in the happy position of not having written the document—it is not a Government document. We must remember that we are dealing with different member states and different traditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). I welcome his contribution to this very much preparatory instrument. The United Kingdom has a tradition whereby those who have been working here under the work permit system can get reasonably early access to indefinite leave to remain and then to citizenship. Other countries have employed the concept of guest workers. It may well be that the reference is to that concept of civic citizenship. I am not sure that that has the same resonance in the British context, which is why, as I told the Lords, we are not sure precisely what it means, but we will seek clarification from the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the reference in fact suggest that, despite all the Government's assurances that the charter is no more than declaratory, the Commission and other member states believe that the charter is actually an important foundation for activity and legislation, and is justiciable before the European court?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i></p>

	<p>That the Committee takes note of European Union Document No. 11529/00, a Commission Communication on a Community immigration policy; and supports the Government's active participation in the debate on the Communication and the Government's intention to ensure that the UK's immigration policies are broadly in line with those of other Member States, whilst retaining domestic control over immigration policy and avoiding measures that could undermine the integrity of the UK's frontier controls.— [
	<i>Mrs. Roche</i>]</p>

	<p>11.28 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Gale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We covered much of the detailed ground during questions, so I will try to keep my comments brief. Like the Minister, I found the Commission's communication a useful peg on which to hang a debate about immigration policy. I draw the Committee's attention to an even better paper entitled "Migration and Economic and Social Analysis" which was prepared by the Home Office's research department. Although I did not agree with every statement therein, I found it a helpful introduction to the subject as it contained a lot of useful information and ideas. I hope that the Minister will commend her officials on that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate raises two important and intertwined issues: first, whether there should be a common European immigration policy; and secondly, whether—either in the European or the national context—there is a strong case for making significant changes to the immigration regime that we in the United Kingdom have operated for many years so as to allow more economic migrants lawfully to come to this country, either as temporary workers or with rights eventually to settle. I shall take those two aspects of the debate in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sceptical and cautious about the case for a common European immigration policy. I have always understood why there is a strong demand on the continent of Europe for such a policy and why that led to the negotiation of the Schengen agreement and is now leading to developments such as those outlined in the communication. On the Franco-German border— or, in future, on the border between Germany and Poland—it is not possible to control immigration through border checks in the way to which we in the United Kingdom are accustomed. Our geography, and, to some extent our history, enables us to exercise border control in a more effective manner than is possible in continental countries in which long land frontiers are crisscrossed by many different road and rail routes, making it easy for people to slip on foot or by vehicle from one country to another. In Alsace or the Rhineland of Germany, which borders France, we find people who for many years have been accustomed to go on shopping trips across a national frontier. On much of the continent, the debate is different in character from that which we in the United Kingdom tend to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I am not opposed to other European countries forging ahead with a common system of immigration control if that is what they judge to be in their best national interest, but I hope that the UK Government will conduct cautious and sceptical scrutiny of any proposals that come from the Commission and are discussed in the Council to implement such a policy, and that they will hesitate long and hard before deciding that the United Kingdom should opt into particular policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My views on the matter are summed up by the paragraph that my noble Friend Baroness Young sought to include in the House of Lords Select Committee report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The United Kingdom, because of its geographical position, is particularly well placed to maintain an autonomous and effective admissions policy."</p></blockquote>
Community institutions are not accountable—their members cannot be sacked in the same way that members of this Committee can be sacked by our electorates should they disagree with our decisions. If Community institutions start to take responsibility for issues such as admissions policy, cultural identity and the ways in which migrants are integrated into different nation states, we could end up with a European blueprint that takes no account of the reality of national identity and loyalty. Quite inadvertently, we could end up with Community decisions that add fuel to political extremism of the sort that, regrettably, we have seen in many western European countries over the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a sceptic about the need for a common immigration policy. Clear assumptions seem to run through the document suggesting that a common European legislative framework to govern immigration is the natural order of things. During our question time I referred to particular examples of that—the idea of indicative targets, and of a legislative scheme for third-country nationals based on a limited number of statuses that would be defined in European rather than national law. I am in favour of sensible co-operation between the United Kingdom and other European countries to establish an effective and fair system of immigration control. However, I am afraid that the tenor of the communication takes us further towards a centrally driven, pan-European immigration policy, which is something I hoped the British Government would resist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have a criticism of the Minister's response to some of the questions, it is that she took too much of a hands-off approach, which seemed to say, "We in Britain wait to see what comes up in terms of a detailed proposal from the Commission before we decide to opt in or out". At the end of the day, that is the legal position of the UK—at least for the moment. However, in practice, the Minister does not wait for a proposal to emerge in its finished form. We have a permanent representation in Brussels that is in day-to day contact with the relevant directorates-general of the Commission, and with the Commissioners responsible for the development of policy. We have embassies in each of the other member state capitals.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
At official level, Whitehall Departments are, surely, already aware of the drift of thinking within the Commission, as Commission officials prepare more detailed papers for discussion later this year. If we look towards the end of the communication, on page 23, we find that it is proposed
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the results of this debate be discussed at a conference to be held under the Belgian Presidency in the second half of 2001 and that the conclusions of this conference be"</p></blockquote>
discussed by the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Council at its meeting in Brussels at the end of 2001."</p></blockquote>
The Brussels meeting will also consider
	<br><blockquote><p>"a mid-term review of the implementation of the Tampere programme."</p></blockquote>
The Minister was a bit insouciant in not taking account of the timetable that was set at Vienna and at Tampere—a five-year timetable which runs out in the middle of 2004, which the Commission and a number of member states will be keen to see implemented within the allotted time. We are debating this matter towards the end of April, and it looks as though the results of the debate that the communication is intended to initiate are due to be discussed under the Belgian presidency either in July this year, or later in September. We are talking about only a few months within which the Commission will suggest rather more detailed proposals. It is not unreasonable to ask the Government for a rather more detailed account of their thinking about some of the ideas floated in the communication than the Minister has been prepared to provide us with this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A general proposition about economic migration lies at the heart of both the Commission paper and the Home Office research paper. I agree with the analysis in both papers, in that the pressures for international migration will not simply disappear. Pull factors are clearly involved and are dependent on the policies pursued by individual countries, which we have had many opportunities to debate, and to which the Select Committee chaired by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington referred in its recent report on United Kingdom border controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spread of knowledge about the world in which we live through television and radio, which enables people in relatively poor countries to know about life in rich and more secure countries; the availability of relatively cheap intercontinental air travel; the involvement of organised crime in the trafficking of people; and the globalisation of the world economy mean that migratory pressures will continue for the foreseeable future. All Governments, regardless of political stripe, will have to grapple with those pressures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not yet persuaded that the economic pressures on the United Kingdom mean that we should consider a significant relaxation of our system of immigration control. It is a misnomer to call what we have had for the past couple of decades zero immigration. We have had immigration control, but immigration has been nothing like zero. The most recent Home Office statistical bulletin on immigration, which gives figures for the calendar year 1999, shows that a total of 97,120 people were accepted for settlement in the United Kingdom, the greatest proportion of whom—more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
than 65,000—were the spouses and dependants of British nationals. More than 22,000 people were accepted here because they had been awarded refugee status or granted exceptional leave to remain, and about 8,000 settlement cases could be described as work related, most of which involved people who had been here on work permits for four years or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to those nearly 100,000 people accepted for settlement, in 1999, 76,000 people were allowed to come here with a work permit to fulfil a particular economic need, and just over 15,000 people were entitled to come here under the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. If we add to that students and visitors, we are not discussing zero immigration. In considering whether more people are needed here to fulfil economic needs, we need to bear in mind that context of what is going on at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for greater economic migration stems from two quarters: first, from business people, especially those in information technology, who say that there is a specific skill shortage at present. Such shortages can often be remedied by the effective use of work permits to bring people in temporarily until the domestic market adjusts to the requirements. Secondly—it may be a longer-term need—there is a demand for people from abroad to take up relatively low-paid and unskilled work. In the south-east of England, the national health service relies heavily on nurses who have been allowed to come here from third-world countries to fill skills shortages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Stoke Mandeville hospital in my constituency there has been substantial recruitment of nurses from the Philippines recently, and the same is true at Wycombe general hospital in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Sir R. Whitney). That is not a bad thing, but the work permit scheme needs to be kept under review. I shall be interested in the Government's analysis of recent changes to the scheme, which will show how those changes are working in practice. I am not persuaded that there is a case for going further than ensuring that the employer-driven scheme is flexible and can keep up to date with movements in our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) raised a subject that is relevant to the debate—the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union. Under the treaty of Rome, there is already complete freedom for anyone from one EU country to move to another EU country to take up work. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, a fair number of people working in this country illegally come from eastern European countries that are candidate members of the European Union. If Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic come into the EU within the next few years, presumably their citizens will be entitled to work here lawfully as a result of their treaty rights. If that happens, does it not weaken the case for a further relaxation of immigration control, as those with treaty rights will be able to take up the slack in the British economy—as large numbers of them do unlawfully at present?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

On illegal immigration, the Commission communication made the point that it is an essential concomitant of a sensible immigration policy—the Commission wants a more liberal immigration policy—that effective action should be taken against people who come into the European Union or the United Kingdom unlawfully. This country has always relied on port checks as the prime means of immigration control. The Home Office statistical bulletin states that in 1999 just under 23,000 people were the subject of enforcement action and only 6,400 were known to have left the United Kingdom in that year as a result of such action. Although I concede that more than 6,400 people may have departed voluntarily rather than waiting for enforcement action, we are still looking at small numbers compared with the various estimates from the Immigration Service Union and others about the number of people who either enter the United Kingdom unlawfully or overstay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points that continental politicians make repeatedly is that we in Britain should copy them in imposing greater internal checks—whether by identity or entitlement cards or whatever. They believe that we should make greater use of what they see as a natural and essential part of their system of immigration control. While I welcome the Minister's comments on that subject, pressure from Europe for us to conform to the pattern of internal controls is bound to increase. If we have a genuine common European immigration policy, governed by European legislation, the pressure on the United Kingdom to conform will get ever greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sceptical about the need for both a common community immigration policy in the way that is implied by the Commission communication and a significant relaxation in our domestic immigration controls for economic reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this debate. I hope that the Minister can give the Committee an undertaking that there will be full parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals that emerge from the Commission before the British Government bind themselves to opt in to measures that could have a significant impact on our system of immigration control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The terms of the motion before us today are appropriate. I will be happy to support to them. The immigration and migration arrangements of the United Kingdom and other member states have distinctive features. Earlier, I mentioned birth rates. Some countries such as Italy, Spain and Germany have plummeting birth rates and migration will be appropriate for population replacement just to keep their economies going. The position may not be the same here. There are reasons for migration that are beneficial to the states themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have set on one side the humanitarian case of genuine asylum seekers. That clearly must be sustained. We cannot condemn people to death, torture or victimisation because we do not allow them into our country. We are not talking about them this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
morning, although we will be doing so next week. Migration has always occurred. It has been beneficial to our economy over the centuries and has made us an interesting and dynamic place to live. Everyone in this room is descended from people who migrated—often illegally, as part of an invasion. The Anglo-Saxons, the Vikings and the Normans all came here. My ancestors were not legal migrants, but warriors who settled here and said, "We'll have a bit of that, thank you very much." We are descended from robbers and invaders. Hopefully, we have now become more civilised. Since then, we have had migrations of people fleeing from persecution, such as the Huguenots and the Jews. People have come here from Ireland who had fled from death and starvation and, more recently, we have had immigration from the Asian sub-continent, the West Indies, Africa and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am privileged to represent a multicultural, multiracial constituency, which has benefited from significant migration over the past 50 years. It is a very interesting place and I am delighted to be its Member of Parliament. Such migration has been exciting; it has made us more conscious of being part of a wider humanity. Clearly, immigration policies are necessary and appropriate. By and large, our system is working much better as a result of the Government putting more resources into the Home Office in particular to regulate immigration and to bring forward the enormous backlog of bureaucracy that existed when they came into office. There is a long way to go, but things have improved considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, when considering desirable migration we should look not only at highly skilled people. Encouraging people to migrate to take up employment in lower-skilled jobs should not be used as an excuse to pay lower wages. It may be low pay, rather than a lack of people to do the work, which is the cause of a shortage of hospital cleaners. We have made a start with the minimum wage, but we have a good way to go to raise it to the level that we would expect to see elsewhere in the European Union. We should not use migrants as a way in which to undermine pay levels and deliberately ask people to come here to work for poor pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to a steady migration in the future. It is only recently that we have had net immigration. For a long time we had net emigration. I have said that many times in political discussions, especially to those who are uncomfortable about people coming from overseas to live and work in Britain. For many years, more people were leaving the country than entering it. We now have a multicultural society that has made this country a much more interesting and exciting place. The relatively grey monocultural society in which I lived when I was a child has now disappeared. In my constituency, I can eat food from all over the world, listen to a dozen different languages and meet people with tremendous ideas from different parts of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The wording of the motion is about right, given that, like those of other member states, our migration arrangements and our economic and social position have distinctive features. It preserves the British qualification. That is right and will probably continue for a considerable time. We in the European Union are neither socially nor economically homogeneous and, with the enlargement of the Community, we will become more diverse economically. I welcome the specific terms of the motion and I am happy to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.59 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have been a member of a European Standing Committee, which is surprising for a pro-European like me. I hope that the Committee supports the motion. I entirely agree with it. There is a reasonable case for having no immigration controls. They are a relatively recent invention. People from this country used to travel all around the world. When they came back, they would go down the Old Kent road, trade and sell their wares. There were no passport controls, and the world used to do well by it. We should not therefore presume that there will always be immigration controls. Indeed, the difficulty of enforcing them, with which we all have to grapple, is one of the strong arguments against having them. We might have two different kinds of status— those who are nationals of a country and have passports, and those who have a different status with different civic rights. We have not reached that point yet, however, and we need to have a debate about whether it is the right conclusion. I am not persuaded that it is the right conclusion, but it should be an option on the agenda. We should keep it in mind that that is how the world used to work, and the world might be better if we returned to that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, it is sensible to do two things, which are the two key elements of the case that the Minister put to the Committee. First, we must welcome and take part in the debate initiated by the European Union about having, as far as possible, a common and integrated policy. There must be merit in that—the Minister referred to many of the reasons why it is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general terms, European countries have similarly low birth rates. I understand that Portugal, for example, has a particular demographic problem. It has always seemed to me a paradox that Italy, which has a higher percentage of Roman Catholics than any other European country, has the lowest birth rate. Either the Italians are extremely self-disciplined—which is not my experience of them—or they all disobey the Pope, which seems much more likely. Although they sign up to the faith in one respect, they seem to have an opt-out clause in their personal life, which allows them to keep the birth rate down. Generally, there is a low birth rate, and there are huge needs in terms of skills, to which the Minister referred. Therefore, having such a debate would seem sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it seems sensible—and this puts me in a different position from some of my more European-integrationist colleagues—for the UK to retain its own
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
controls. We are an island country—or a set of islands—and we have the natural opportunity of being more able to regulate our borders than other countries. For the time being, it seems right to maintain that rather than get rid of it. It would be controversial and difficult for the Government to argue a case for getting rid of those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The country seems to understand the argument for more immigration. Those who argue against immigration seem to forget how many people from this country have gone to other parts of the world as economic migrants. Huge numbers have gone to the empire or the Commonwealth—which constitutes about half the world—assuming that they will be able to go and work in Canada, South Africa, Australia or New Zealand. People assume that they can happily settle in other EU countries after retirement, but they become nervous about other people exercising the same economic migration opportunities here. People who say, "It's fine for me to better myself, for my daughter and son-in-law to go and live in Australia, and for my family to make their home where the weather, prospects and economic situation are better, but it is not good for people to come here," are very selfish and biased. I spend a lot of time challenging that view in my constituency and elsewhere when people argue it and forget, as the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) said, not only the benefits of immigration, but the opportunities that emigration has presented to many of our people, who have also remitted money home over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the comments made by the Government and the Minister in seeking clarification of the proposal, which is supported as a subject for proper debate by my colleagues in the European Parliament and elsewhere and in other parties in the European Union, we need to have a constructive debate with the countries of origin and transit. It is no good having a European view that could easily become a fortress Europe view, without ensuring that it reflects the needs and aspirations of the countries from which people come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the second issue, which concerns the core rights for long-resident third country nationals— the slightly ambiguous civic citizenship concept. Like the Minister, I think that it needs to be fleshed out, but in general, those who are not passport holders or nationals should have a status that gives them certain entitlements that are easily understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, like me and every other member of the Committee, may have done a bit of canvassing over recent weeks, and discovered people who are registered to vote but are not registered to vote in UK elections because they are EU nationals and in a different category. Their status allows them to be in the country, and some have been here, as foreign nationals, for 25 years. They may be married to a British citizen and have not decided to take British citizenship. I met an American on Saturday night who has been in the country for more than 25 years but who has decided, on balance, to keep his American
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
citizenship. There is a benefit in giving a status to such people that makes their rights and responsibilities clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly confused by the third area in which the Government say that they will seek clarification. That is the
	<br><blockquote><p>"difficulty with proposals that granted rights of residence for such persons in other Member States."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand what the Government are getting at, and it would be helpful for the Minister to amplify the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pick up on the point of dealing with illegal migration, which was made in the Commission's conclusions and mentioned by the Minister. Of course, if we have an immigration policy, there must be an enforcement mechanism, and we must ensure that it works. However, a reason for the debate—one on which I think that the Minister and I share common ground—is that it is clear that some people who seek to enter this country by making a case for asylum would rather make a case for economic migration. We should not be naive about that. In reality, we must have a system that makes it possible for people to make their case in the country that they happen to be in. That case may be humanitarian, for a family reunion, for economic migration or for asylum. People will need assistance to decide what is appropriate and what works for them. I am frustrated that we do not have a proper system in which it is possible to seek asylum legally in this country—that is why I encourage the Government to make progress on the matter. The Minister has previously heard me say that I believe that we are breaking our international obligations by not having a method by which an asylum seeker can legally come here and seek asylum. The Government are clearly in breach of the convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister disagrees, but it must be the case. The system should also allow people legally to put forward their case for economic migration, and the sooner that that is possible, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have a more common agreed European Union policy, I hope that it will take account of the natural ties and settlements. However, I qualify that by saying that there are additional rights and controls that the Government are right to continue to keep. Self-evidently, language often means that immigrants from some countries will be more likely to make their home and wish to work in certain European Union countries. People from Brazil would be more likely to go to Portugal. People from Commonwealth countries who are, in the main, English speakers, would be more likely to wish to come to the UK. People from the old French empire would be more likely to wish to go to France, and people from Zaire would wish to go to Belgium. I hope that any policy will build natural communities. We do not want to freeze ourselves by limiting ourselves to such countries—although the Commonwealth includes half the world, and each continent—but due account should be taken of natural ties, natural patterns of migration and natural communities. Whatever ends up as the policy should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
properly reflect the fact that it would be unreasonable to expect people to apply to countries that they did not wish to go to. All that would do would delay a further application to move from one country to the one that they wished to go to at the end of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the debate, which has been good. The Minister and I have had our disagreements, but, over the past few months, the Government have become more enlightened on the matter, and have used more appropriate language and measured tones. They have further distanced themselves from the Tory party, which is welcome. I hope that they will continue in that more enlightened vein after the election, which may be in a few weeks' time, whether they are in government or opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.10 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution. A debate on immigration policy is long overdue in both the European Union and the UK. We probably have to go back to the Immigration Act 1971 for the previous time that the UK seriously debated the issue. Since then, there have been changes in the immigration rules, and we have had various debates about mechanisms. I served on the Standing Committees that considered the previous three immigration and asylum Bills, but there was remarkably little debate about policy. Everything was about mechanisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For 30 years, we have not really considered what the aims of our immigration policies should be. I therefore very much welcome the debate that has been stimulated both by the Minister and in the EU, which is now getting involved with the issue. It is an interesting coincidence that the 1971 Act came into force not in that year, but on 1 January 1973, the day on which we joined what was then called the common market. It has taken us that time to start to have a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper has developed as the labour market and effects on the economy have been considered. Economic migration has taken place in the past 30 years, even in terms of family reunion. The hon. Member for Aylesbury talked about the right of British citizens to have their families join them here. However, that is not an absolute right. We have always applied economic tests, even to questions of family reunion. We have certainly applied economic tests to other people who wish to come to the UK through the work permit scheme or schemes for business men. Anyone with enough money to invest has been able to come here relatively freely for quite some time. However, we have not had systematic thoughts about how that should work. The situation has developed ad hoc, and sets of rules have been developed without thought for their consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have these EU papers and EU competence as a result of Amsterdam and the discussions that have taken place since Tampere. Whether or not we feel that the UK should adopt every part of the EU's policy in this respect, it is clear that we cannot sit outside the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
debate. What happens in the EU will impact on us. Whether or not we decide at the end of the day to opt-in to every decision that is taken by the EU, we must be involved in the debate. Questions about which and how many people we allow to come here for the labour market are inevitably bound up with the EU, as there is a system of freedom of movement for citizens of the EU and the European Economic Area. Growing numbers of people also arrive through association agreements with countries that are not yet full members of the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of questions were asked about the details of how we might implement schemes that relate to economic migration. I have doubts about what the impact will be on illegal immigration if all that we have are systems that admit only highly skilled and highly educated people. I therefore welcome what the Minister said about the need to think more broadly about the impact on seasonal workers or unskilled labour that might or might not be needed in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the effect of remittances to home countries and the impact on them of people coming here as migrants. If we are honest, we will admit that our immigration policies will always be selfish to a degree. We will always think about what the impact of our immigration policies will be on us, but the impact on the countries from which migrants have come is also important. Pulling away skilled and educated labour that is in short supply can be damaging. The debate should not be about mechanisms alone; we should assess the impact on the countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier that we should make the best possible use of the skills available here. For the first time last year, the Government commendably published a paper that dealt with the integration of recognised refugees and referred to the skills base that could be used. At some stage we will have to decide what should be done with people who have been working here illegally for some time and are unlikely to be removed from the country. As well as bringing such people into legality, we need to assess how best to use their skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also mentioned earlier the issue of mobility and the expansion of the EU. The Commission's paper does not properly deal with overall labour mobility. Since freedom of movement within the EU has been allowed, the extent of labour mobility across national boundaries has been relatively small and it has mainly involved relatively highly skilled people. We have not seen significant internal movement of unskilled labour within the EU. It has happened, but not to a large extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions must be asked about what will happen when the EU expands eastwards. The document is about people from non-EU countries migrating into the EU, but if we consider the wider aspects of labour markets and migration, the eastern expansion becomes important. Countries from which we currently have illegal migrants will be brought into the EU. Some of those countries demand the movement of labour, which might change the patterns of internal movement within the EU and impact on what should be done about external migration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
The paper is right to say that migratory pressures will continue: it is inevitable, and the ease of worldwide travel nowadays will exacerbate those pressures. We are at the beginning of an important and detailed debate. I am glad that the Government have stimulated the debate in Europe. We may not want to adopt every dot and comma of the EU's policies, but it is vital for us to be in there influencing the debate, as it will certainly influence us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.18 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate and I should like to deal briefly with some of the issues—I am aware that the Committee has probably heard quite enough of me this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Aylesbury for his comments on the migration research document. I will ensure that my officials are aware of the hon. Gentleman's generous remarks. I agree that it is a remarkably good piece of work, which draws together several sources, some for the first time, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I assure him that our permanent representative to the European Union, the gloriously named UKREP, especially the section that deals with justice and home affairs matters, is fully engaged in the process. All proposals will receive the appropriate scrutiny of the House and the other place; we will use the system of explanatory memorandums to inform the Committee and the House of the progress of such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the analysis of my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North: this country is a nation of migrants and always has been. There is a popular belief that immigration started with the Jewish community or with the Huguenots, but it goes back for centuries before that, as anyone who saw Simon Schama's excellent programme "The History of Britain," or read the book, will know, and we are much the better for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked about our difference with the European Commission. The Heads of Government agreed, quite rightly, at Tampere that third country nationals legally resident in EU states should be accorded proper rights and treatment, which we enthusiastically supported. However, we have difficulties with the proposition that third country nationals legally resident in one country should have the right of residence in another EU country. We believe that they have to satisfy the immigration policies of the individual states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred briefly to asylum. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will endorse what I say, that under the convention, there is no obligation on any member state to facilitate the making of an asylum application. It is inaccurate that we are in breach of the convention. However, in speeches in London and last year in Lisbon, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary drew attention to the way in which the convention operates in the modern
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
age. He raised the possibility of making applications in the regions and of considering how the convention operates in an age that those who framed it in 1951 could not have envisaged. As we approach the 50th anniversary, it is appropriate to have the debate, which was initiated by the UNHCR.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what the hon. Gentleman said about the separation of migration and asylum. A good reason for their being separate is that asylum is a precious and fundamental right. If asylum is not ring fenced as a fundamental right to claim protection from persecution, the right itself is undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the characteristically thoughtful remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, who has considerable knowledge of the subject. I agree with him that we have rarely debated the general themes of immigration and migration policy, although we have discussed specific pieces of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I became something of a migration bore while I was preparing for my September speech. As I was on holiday while I was writing the speech, I had time to undertake background research. The debate on the issue can be traced back to the Aliens Act 1905, and perhaps beyond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the House has debated individual pieces of legislation on immigration, neither it, nor the country, has properly debated migration, especially in relation to our nation's needs. I agree with my hon. Friend that it is a complex issue that requires a number of matters to be considered. The hon. Member for Aylesbury also alluded to that point. It is, for instance, particularly important to hold discussions with source countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow about the national refugee integration strategy. We published the document in November 2000, and we subsequently set up a national strategy implementation group, which I chair. It meets not only in London, but elsewhere too, and it has made substantial progress by dealing with practical issues that need to be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been an important discussion. I believe that the debate on immigration should not only focus on the important matter of dealing with illegal immigration. It should also focus on supporting appropriate opportunities, when they are in the economic and general national interest, for legal migration into a diverse and tolerant society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
