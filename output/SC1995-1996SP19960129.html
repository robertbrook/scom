	<section>

	<div class='title'>Submission by Crew 2000</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>Over the past ten years there has been an escalation of teenage drug misuse which is unparalleled since the 1960's. This has been fuelled by a rebirth of interest in the so-called "psychedelic" drugs of the 1960's; Cannabis, Ecstasy, Eve, LSD as well as Amphetamine Sulphate.</p>

	<p>The use of psychedelics and stimulants by young people in Scotland, as in England, is largely associated with other cultural events and activities; going to "raves", club events, attending football matches etc. The users are predominantly under twenty-five, of no particular class background, usually in employment. Very few are involved in crime (other than the crimes they commit in purchasing and consuming controlled substances) and most do not use drugs on a daily basis. This group of young people have separate needs to those traditionally seen by specialist drug services. Indeed this group would not generally define itself as problematic, would rarely attend such services and are generally contemptious of opiate users. Crew 2000 was established in Edinburgh in 1992 in response to this developing situation as a loose coalition of local young people active in the club scene, supported, but not led by drug workers. The coalition is committed to a peer education and harm reduction approach to young peoples drug misuse and works predominantly in the club and rave scene in Scotland. In a Crew 2000 survey of young people in Edinburgh in 1994, 67 per cent. said they used drugs in the last six months with only 10 per cent. saying they had experienced problems related to their drug use. The data showed high levels of recreational drug use and experimentation. However, there were also very low levels of knowledge about the drugs being used with 37 per cent. answering correctly to questions about Temazepam and only 2 per cent. answering correctly on Ecstasy.</p>

	<p>Widespread use of recreational drugs such as Ecstasy has caused concern principally because of an increasing number of cases of serious toxicity and even death when the drug has been used in a "rave" or club environment. However, as Dr. Russell Newcombe states 
	<i>"MDMA related deaths are often the result of heat exhaustion, which requires such additional contributory factors as hot environment, a lack of water intake, vigorous exercise for long periods, and probably biological predisposers as well</i>"
	<div class='sup'>1</div> <!-- sup --></p>

	<p>This evidence is backed up by Solowij in her review of the MDMA literature (1992, p412) who concludes that vigorous dancing by ecstasy users at rave parties and nightclubs is a key factor in ecstasy-related deaths: 
	<i>"It appears that a combination of sustained physical</i>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>

	<i>exertion, high ambient temperatures and inadequate fluid replacement compound a direct pharmacological effects of MDMA on thermo-regulatory mechanisms, leading to fulminant hyperthermia."</i> 
	<div class='sup'>2</div> <!-- sup --> In the majority of cases of Ecstasy-related deaths, the deaths were caused by the way in which the drug was used and not specifically from the drug itself. This would suggest that if aspects of the environment where Ecstasy is used were controlled then risks would be reduced.</p>

	<p>Over the last few years it has been demonstrated that the demand for raving cannot be reduced by repressive action from the authorities. Therefore policy and strategy should be aimed at reducing the harmful effects of the use of dance drugs at clubs and raves. At this point it is worth noting that at events where adequate safety measures have existed there have been no fatalities and a reduction of casualties. This can be illustrated through the experience of the Hardcore rave event Rezerection which is organised at Ingleston outside Edinburgh every three months. The event attracts 5000 people and the promoters Kitchenware rely on agency co-operation to ensure the safety of their events. The Red Cross, Scottish Ambulance Service, Police, Environmental Health and ourselves Crew 2000 work together to create a safe environment based on a harm reduction approach. The conditions attached to holding such large events are stringently regulated and enforced by the local licensing board. Obviously the same conditions do not presently apply to smaller clubs and while a lot of clubs owners are responsible and are concerned about the safety of their customers, many put profit first and go unregulated.</p>

	<p>The "Guidelines of Good Practice at Dance Events" compiled by the Scottish Drugs Forum offers a code of practice for clubs which will help to provide safer venues. The guidelines offer practical harm reduction advice which will help to reduce the risks associated with using dance drugs in a club environment.</p>

	<p>Over the last two years Crew 2000 have worked in clubs around Scotland distributing information on reducing the risks associated with drug use. This has developed to providing an outreach service on-site in clubs providing advice, basic first aid, work with people suffering from drug-induced paranoia. Many young people take responsibility for their drug use in educating themselves about the dangers of the drugs they are using. Education on its own is insufficient if the venues used by drug users are unsafe and club owners are unaware of how to improve the safety of their venue.</p>

	<p>It is our experience that drug use is a part of life for many young people and efforts to totally eradicate drug use from clubs have failed. The extension of powers to local licensing board will enable them to impose guidelines on clubs to provide a safer environment. This is a crucial step in attempting to reduce the risk of fatalities through drug use. Additionally through the development of a Safer Dancing programme, drug agencies providing outreach services at clubs will have an ideal opportunity to work directly with young drug users to inform and educate them on the risks attached to using drugs.</p>

If, at the end of questioning, you feel that something has not been mentioned, on which you want to remark, you will be given an opportunity to speak. We shall keep strictly to our two-hour timetable, but you will be told when it is five minutes before the end. I hope that we shall have pertinent questions and, wherever possible, short answers. The more questions there are, the more answers we shall receive from you, which will help the Committee in its deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish Drugs Forum helps with the production of "Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events" and the Scottish Office will give further guidance to supplement that.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over and above the detail that the booklet refers to, we would like to have a dialogue with those who will be responsible for deciding how the legislation will be implemented. We want to discuss that today to give the Committee the benefit of our experience of young people in the arena of drugs, clubs and popular culture. We are reasonably well versed in those matters and have knowledge of the practicalities involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would like some uniformity in how the Bill is implemented by different councils. We propose an advisory committee, comprised of professionals who have been working in various areas, ranging from the medical area to policing and drug information groups. It would be a national body that the different councils could consult, which would ensure uniformity in the implementation of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been a number of questions concerning the definition of a rave, which has caused a certain amount of confusion. There is a definition at the beginning of the guidelines, which I put in because I felt that certain promoters and organisers of events were ducking and diving to avoid using the term, which has become so contentious. The high prevalence of drug use is more a youth phenomenon than a dance phenomenon and much of the guidance could apply equally to anyone running a licensed nightclub, irrespective of the sort of music that is played. By the law of averages, those running a club will come across drugs incidence and will need to know how to deal with it. They should all be looking to provide a safe, comfortable environment for their clientele. It is not only people who listen to techno music who take drugs. The guidelines should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
broadened and issued to clubs in general, not that clubs are by any means the only places where recreational drug use takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does give a definition of "rave". On Second Reading, I said that any dancing, going back to the waltz, could have fitted that description. Are you saying that there should be no strict definition and it should cover all music played for dancing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When talking about whether it is appropriate to have drugs information available, the best people to call in are those in the local drugs service, who will be very well aware of the issues in the locality. There could be a problem if the definition is too strict because people could deny that an event is a rave. They could call it whatever they liked. The drugs issue is an issue for everyone. It will be an issue for anyone running a nightclub. Much of the guidance is just as relevant to an over-25s disco as to a techno dance event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To extend that in a practical way, I should say that many of the nightclubs in Glasgow that our teams has visited in the past six months or so have many uses. Various promoters organise different events. If we over-define and make the definition too narrow, that would fail to accommodate the multiplicity of use. It is a vibrant culture. To return to the question of waltzing, I am pretty sure that no two waltz clubs were the same. They would each have had their own big band sound and so on. There is nothing new about that today. We find that even a club that was formerly known strictly as a discotheque may now have more nights that may be associated with rave music, so we have to be contemporary in our approach. Our advice to the Committee is to be careful about over-defining in a regimented way that would not allow for an accurate and contemporary look at the situation. As has been said, we have confidence in our own abilities and intelligence about what is actually happening. We can offer a fairly informed view of what situation may be expected at any given club night or event.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press a little more on the advisory committee. Can we have some flesh put on the bones? What exactly do you have in mind and how exactly do you see it working?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea would be to have a national advisory body made up of professionals and people experienced in working in the area, whether putting on large rave events or working in clubs, police with experience of licensing events and environmental health officers, who know a lot more about the factors that should be considered when someone puts on an event in a club.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem that could arise is that councils will interpret the guidelines in various different ways and may not have the appropriate knowledge, because they may not have had a lot of events taking place in their area. A national body that took responsibility away from the licensing board would be able to draw on much more in-depth knowledge. Somebody who was opening a club and putting on various events could refer to the advisory body, which could tell them about different aspects. This is an example of the flexibility of the Bill. A lot of smaller

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
clubs will not be able to provide a chill-out room, but they need to know how they can adapt the guidelines to fit their venues. The guidelines will not be used by councils to close clubs; clubs can be advised on how to adapt the Bill to their existing venue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a concern of mine that the guidelines could be taken too literally, and that people who were running their venues responsibly, but were unable to put in a chill-out room—which is only one way of dealing with the issue of excessive overcrowding and excessive heat, could be affected. I was concerned that, first, licences should not be removed on a technicality and, secondly, that providing any old room, no matter how uninviting and cold, could be seen as being responsible. That is another reason why we were discussing the possibility of having an advisory committee to consider each individual case when implementing the guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly this Bill has arisen from Bill concerns about the use of the drugs and the problem of dehydration. Do I take it from what you said about different types of event that you believe that the powers given to the licensing boards should be extended to looking at other venues, in which the same coterminous dangers—the use of drugs and the danger of dehydration—do not exist? Or do you accept that the Bill is designed only to deal with the question of use of drugs, dance and the resulting possibility of dehydration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is a very important point for us. As I said before, various promoters use the same venue. It seems to us to make perfect sense that anybody who pays to go out and enjoy himself in clubland should be able to enter an establishment that has clearly come up to scratch with a certain set of standards. That is what we would like to see. Whether you go ballroom dancing or whatever, you would expect the place to be reasonably ventilated. That could be a problem, with people enjoying themselves in the way that they do. In a country with so much clean drinking water, you would expect its availability to extend to those places. Clearly, there is a relationship between the use of the substance, all-night dancing, aggressive dancing and the heatstroke condition that ended in tragedy for a number of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like to see the clubs more up to scratch on basic customer care, including ventilation, cool and clear drinking water, adequate and effective stewarding, appropriate first aid and other facilities. The attitude of staff should be influenced by an awareness that drugs are part of today's culture. Staff should have had a chance to train and rehearse, rather than just responding to an incident on a particular night. They should have had a chance to be alive to and up to date with late 20th-century types of incident that you would expect to see in just about any nightclub.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Members of Parliament from across the country will recognise that the problem is not peculiar to the city centres. It is a youth phenomenon, as has been said, all over the country. If there were uniformity, fairness and applicability, that would lead to a much safer expectation—you could expect to go anywhere and have reasonable standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask Enhance and Crew 2000 a question. Before we get into the more formal argy-bargy that usually takes place during the Committee stage of a Bill, the purpose of a Special Standing Committee is to allow us to hear from the people who will have to deal with the effects of the legislation that we, rightly or wrongly, introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what you think of the Secretary of State's initiative, which was launched with a lot of hype. Do you think it is helpful or do you think that it is more a reaction, reflecting politicians' concern to be seen to be doing something? Do you think that it will achieve something or are there shortcomings in the initiative?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which initiative are you talking about—Scotland against Drugs, or the one surrounding the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland against Drugs—this all-party, let us tackle it together, approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two separate issues. One is the safer dancing guidelines and how they will be implemented, which we are here to talk about today. We welcome the initiative to make clubs a safer environment. The motivation behind it is fairly irrelevant. The fact that it is happening, and that it is happening in Scotland as a whole, is a pragmatic, realistic move to make clubs safer for people, which we welcome if it is enforced properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue, Scotland against Drugs, is a separate concern. Perhaps we should not confuse the two here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will know that the Bill resulted from the judgment of Sheriff Neil Gow in Ayr, following the fatal accident inquiry. He recommended that the Scottish Office should treat as a matter of considerable urgency the preparation in legislative form of model conditions in licences for raves, dealing in particular with numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will notice from the Bill that there are no model conditions and, if I remember correctly, only 43 out of Scotland's 56 local authorities have byelaws. There is no mandatory element in the Bill, either, after it becomes law there will be no statutory obligation on local authorities. There could be a disparity of treatment under the byelaws of different areas. I wonder what your views are on that. There must be uniformity and consistency, as you said, otherwise there would appear to be a deficiency in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We stated that we have concerns about lack of uniformity and over-zealousness with the implementation. However, there have been other means of trying to encourage promoters and organisers of events to take these issues into consideration. In some ways, it is a case of raising awareness among young people and essentially getting them to demand that basic things be in place. If young people go to a club and cannot get a drink of water, the encouragement would be for them to go elsewhere. We would like to see a situation whereby it is in the financial interests of the organiser to make sure that such things are in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But if you depend on young people, perhaps that is not the right way to go about the matter. For local authorities to have such an obligation would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
appear to be a better way forward. Do you think that it would be helpful if every local authority was obliged to have byelaws, so that matters are mandatory and model conditions are applied throughout the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be good to see model conditions throughout the country, assuming that they are applied with the flexibility that we discussed earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the qualifications suggested by the Bill for licensing boards is that they have to be of the view that offences may be committed at a certain event. My question relates to your proposal for an advisory committee. Are you suggesting that it be national advisory committee or a series of separate local advisory committees? If your proposal relates to a national committee, how can that help a local authority trying to make a decision about a forthcoming event and whether or not drugs will be there? If we do not go down the route of an advisory committee, can you suggest other ways in which a licensing board could comply with that part of the qualification, without introducing it as a blanket measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not meant to sound like a short cut, but if we assume that the level of drugs-taking among young people in Scotland is that suggested by major regional research—such as the national crime survey figures and substantial surveys of evidence—that may be one small step towards assuming that drug availability and drug consumption happens in almost any club. To use that as a starting point would make the approach to the matter much easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An analogy can be made with disease prevention when, to protect everyone else, it is assumed that someone is potentially contagious. For example, if we assume that public houses, as well as having on tap more licit favoured substances, are premises in which dealing in other substances takes place, that might be the place to start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best way to deal with the discretionary power is to treat it as a blanket power and avoid the possibility of some places falling though the safety net.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might save a lot of headache and soul searching locally when asking some awkward questions. The realisation might be, "Let's get real. We are in 1996. We are heading towards the end of the century and drugs are clearly on the agenda for young people, so can we make that assumption and act on it?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Several hon. Members have indicated that they want to ask questions. Does anyone want to ask a question about this matter in particular?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go along entirely with what you have said about the availability of drugs in clubs and pubs. Basically, the Bill deals with the clubs. One of the problems that I have with the closure of Hanger 13 is the fact that it had stewards who carried out pretty thorough searches, closed circuit television and observation points
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
to ensure that drugs were not being moved about. Those are the sort of measures that need to be taken in clubs. What do you think about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Steps can be taken to reduce the prevalence of dealing and so on within licensed premises. We must not forget or overlook the fact that many people procure and consume the substances that they take before they enter premises. Clearly, that is not the business of club or venue owners. As it is obvious when someone drunk and falling about, people would tend not to let them into clubs. However, people do not look any different 15 or 20 minutes after they have taken tablets, so it is difficult to do anything from that point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you are saying, but some events continue for a considerable period. I am suggesting that one of the aims of the Bill should be to stop drugs entering clubs and moving about. That can be done by having good, well-trained stewards and through people submitting to strenuous searches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reality of the situation is that an ecstasy tablet is very easily concealed and, in the absence of strip-searching—which I would not advocate at all—it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to find anything even in the most stringent security search. Once an individual is in a club, a pill can be swallowed as fast as I can click my figures. There are issues around security and there are certain measures that can be taken to reduce the prevalence of things like dealing, but the reality is that it is very difficult to police a tiny ecstasy tablet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been looking at the booklet "Guidelines for Good Practice at Dance Events". Chapter 5 on security clearly gives very good advice. For the purposes of framing legislation, I am concerned about events where, although drugs might be brought in, it is considerably less likely than at other events—for example, if "Come Dancing" were held in Glasgow or if a Scottish country dancing event were held in Poolewe. Can you help us frame legislation so that events where such stringent security would not be necessary are excluded, or do you think that such security should be widespread?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes back to consulting people at a local level. Whether it is an advisory board—or however the licensing board implements it—I think that it would be down to local groups in the area, which have experience and knowledge of working in the various clubs and venues and will be able to assess how necessary it is to have all the measures for things like drugs information in a place where that is relevant and in what form. That is where consultation could take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do you think that they would advise the licensing authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Again, I am just stressing the need for consultation with the groups working in the area. That could happen at a local level between the licensing board, drugs information groups and other groups that want to be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>3 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can just add something. We, at Enhance, are confident in some ways that if the Bill is pragmatic, if it tackles the situation in a very realistic manner and if it does not pitch its hopes too high and well beyond the bounds of possibility, we can look forward to actually moving, in this country, nearer to the club owners in some respects and giving them the opportunity to be honest and realistic in their assessment of their own situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last thing that we want, to underscore a point that was made earlier—indeed, it would horrify us—is for tactics to be taken that would actually discourage promoters and others from actually seeking the appropriate help, advice and assistance on how they can put their own house in order. If they run for cover, we will find that the scenes might run underground. That is not a situation anyone sitting here would want to see, so we hope that we can create the right kind of climate, in the sense of a public debate right down at the local level, where club owners and promoters would not feel ashamed, abashed or even scared to admit to and talk about the realities facing them. That is what we are trying to move towards. Anything that includes common sense, local dialogue, local knowledge and so on is something that we would certainly applaud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To quote back what you said earlier, various different interpretations will be made. That is the essence of devolving power to a local level. Are you suggesting that the Committee should recommend legislating for fixed obligations for all councils, or should there be discretion at local level, as currently exists, allowing councillors to determine local policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two separate issues here. First, there is the question of uniformity, namely, that all councils implement the legislation in the same way. The whole idea of that is that you do not pick and choose which guidelines you choose to use. It all comes as a package and enforcement would be the same throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about flexibility is actually taking individual clubs or venues and applying flexibility in how it would operate. That is where the experience of an advisory group would probably be useful because it would have knowledge of how to implement guidelines in individual outlets. It would have to be something across the board that would be applied locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The council could reject the advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, yes, but the point is that the advisory group would comprise of people who were experienced at working in the area and would probably have some experience that members of the board would not have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are focusing on two things—first, on advice to those putting on events, who may be experienced or may be completely inexperienced, having just come into the business; and secondly, on advice to councils, which brings us to the point about uniformity. Those are not separate, but they are different functions. There might be an argument for
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
localising the function of advising those putting on events, whereas advice given to councils would clearly come from a national level because your aim is for a national pattern of uniformity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, your points are basically correct, but it is important that there should be flexibility on a local level because obviously the venues and the issues are different. Comparing cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow with smaller towns, the issues will be pretty much the same, but they might not have the same experience in having these guidelines in clubs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to a point that was raised earlier. Sheriff Gow wanted model rules and conditions. During Operation Eagle, I attended a seminar in Strathclyde, at which a publican in Paisley was honest enough to say that there had been a drugs event in his pub one night. The police came and told him that he could have been taken to court, but he said that he was unaware of the event at the time. He said, "I was put in a terrible position. I wanted to be honest with the police and myself, so I went to the police and said, 'How do I best go about ensuring that my pub is drugs-free?'" The police in Paisley and the publican worked well together at local level. All members of the Committee want to see such developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not include any byelaws and therefore lacks a mandatory element in that respect. An agreed, consensual practice may apply in one local authority, but a neighbouring local authority may have no such relationship. It is important to crystalise our thoughts about the mandatory element of the Bill and whether model rules should be included. How should local authorities go about their business, albeit at a general level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill makes no provision for applications where alcohol is not available at a rave. Is that a significant weakness in the Bill, or will the rules apply generally when alcohol is not provided? Do the provisions relate to cases where alcohol is provided, or is there a danger that a whole category has been omitted from the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are, for events where alcohol is not available, separate guidelines which are pretty much based on the ideas that are before the Committee. An event that is held just outside Edinburgh has all the factors in place, with drugs information, first aid and chill-out areas. Those measures are put in place fairly stringently; they are already happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is the guide to health, safety and welfare at pop concerts and similar events, which is the document that is usually used to outline safety at non-licensed events. Most of the dance music scene— diverse as it is—takes place in licensed discos and nightclubs, not at huge raves. There are not very many raves any more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those members of the Committee who want to ask questions about this matter should do so; after that, I shall call the hon. Member for Perth and Kinross (Ms Cunningham).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Watson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since you make the point about different venues, I want to ask about touring shows, such as the Ministry of Sound, which play at big venues such as Ingliston and SECC. That is different to the situation in small clubs which have, for example, a weekly promotion. The scale is totally different from that of massive events. Do the same regulations apply? Is a question of scale involved? Do the regulations that need to be applied, in your view, be applied to differently sized venues? When organisations are on tour, should there be some restrictions on the promoter, who often just takes over a premises for an evening? Should the promoter be responsible for the provision of security, or should the owner of the premises be responsible? Is a two-tiered structure involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You mentioned the Ministry of Sound as being a displaced group that tours around at parties; I might also mention the likes of Cream. To my knowledge, they are usually held in licensed nightclubs and not in the SECC or at Ingliston. The only dance event that I know of that takes place at Ingliston is Resurrection, which has to meet a number of very high local criteria before it can go ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Different byelaws apply in different parts of the country. We mentioned groups and organisations that tour Scotland. Obviously, they tend to operate in England as well. How do they adjust? Are they subject in England to regulations that differ from those currently applied in Scotland? What can be learnt from English and Welsh legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To my knowledge, the situation is similar in England, in that in one area they might have to jump through certain hoops, whereas, in another they may not. I do not think that there is uniformity there either. A number of local authorities are starting to attach conditions to an entertainment licence, for instance, but that might not apply in the county next door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To follow up the question, I should have declared earlier that I am a member of the Scottish Drugs Forum. How widespread, in your experience, is the practice of stewards holding first aid certificates? Would you advocate that they must have first aid certificates in order for a licence to be granted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It varies from one club to the next, or from one security firm to the next, in the level of training. I would definitely like to see stewards better trained across the board and better able to recognise when somebody is, for example, showing the early signs of heatstroke or something like that. I think that some of the tragic fatalities that have happened might well have been dealt with more efficiently if the situation had been recognised sooner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the possibility, at certain events, of having trained paramedics on site. Obviously, it is difficult to discern which events should. The thought of having paramedics in every night club in Scotland is ludicrous, but it would be most welcome to see at least two members of staff on the premises who have first aid training and who know, at least, what to do in an emergency. At the moment, we have a situation in which somebody who is potentially ill is asked to leave the premises. I do not think
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
that that necessarily happens in Scotland, but we have seen cases in which security staff have put people out in the street, where they have subsequently died because the security staff misunderstood what was wrong with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree that it would be ludicrous to have paramedics at every single event, but I should like to explore a bit further the question of requiring first aid certificates. Such requirements apply to workplaces in relation to the number of people there. Are your thoughts turning in that direction—toward trying to enforce such a requirement, depending on the number of people attending? It does not seem to me to be too much to ask that there should be at least a few people around who know what they are doing in terms of first aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our experience tends to suggest that clubs are aware of these issues. Part of the problem may be that what is required is not solely first aid, but the right first aid. This is a dialogue involving ourselves and other organisations, including Crew 2000. We are looking to expand into the whole first aid area with some of the nationally recognised institutions—we want to go down that road. We believe that the future lies in cross-talks and cross-learning and so on and we hope that the information will filter down. However, we heard from club owners and promoters in the Glasgow area that the cost of some of the recognised courses, at which local authorities may have looked before, is prohibitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever measures are taken have to be balanced. It has to be appropriate first aid. If the Committee were to go down the road of recommending that that should be enforced, it would be incumbent on the Committee to look at how it would happen on the ground—how freely available courses were, how clubs would be able to afford access to the type of training requirements that the Committee might point to. That is why we began this session talking about practicalities. There are ideals that we wish to see in practice and the practice will be determined by how near we can get to making them achievable. It is back to that achievability and practicality question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for taking you back to a subject which I find very interesting and to which I hope we will return later, and that is the role of stewards, of health and safety and of medical training. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) talked about the possibility of having one local authority or licensing board area that has very lax regulations; one that takes a middle road and perhaps operates best practice; and another that shuts the door by being so strict that we have what you seem to be saying—underground, deregulated dance venues and clubs that are not up to standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us thought that this Bill should have been an amendment to the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. In other words, the Government should have set national guidelines as minimum standards instead of leaving it up to individual licensing boards. You nodded when my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton explained the possible scenarios—as though you agreed that there was the danger of having a wide range of opinions across the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
licensing boards. Do you think that the Government should set over-arching minimum guidelines for all the licensing boards to follow—perhaps just a tweak here and there, but certainly over-arching—so that there could be a scheme for Scotland as a whole rather than licensing board by licensing board? Unfortunately, nods are not good enough for 
	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can express my nod in words. That does make sense in terms of fairness, practicality and uniformity. These are some of the key themes that we have tried to bring here today. Reasonable, enforceable and practical minimums seem to be a way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do the comments that you have just made tie in with your earlier plea for flexibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall go back to the question of flexibility and take one of the themes. The idea of chill-out comes late to us. Most of us did not grow up with the notion of chilling out; it came from the culture over the last 10 years. We have to get realistic about that. In any one given situation, the opportunities to chill out will be determined by a number of things, including the physical structure and dimensions of a building. We are looking for flexibility in the sense of a reasonable approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would certainly go on record as saying that any dance club could be made safer. No matter how safe an environment is at the moment, there must be opportunities for it to be made safer. The Committee should be considering achievable minimums and encouraging us all to work towards maximums—towards ideals—while bearing in mind that we need flexibility, right down to a specific nightspot. That is when the level of flexibility is worth the effort and the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a broader question which is more about the philosophy behind the Bill. You have agreed that the Bill proceeds on the basis of accepting the reality of drug use and the need to deal with that reality in clubs and various events where it is likely to happen. However, we will certainly be criticised by other organisations involved in drugs—they will say that the Bill condones drug use and effectively sends a message to young people that it is now acceptable to take drugs in certain circumstances. How would you counter that criticism? I think that we will hear evidence this afternoon on those lines. How would you counter the criticism that the Bill condones drug use?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very important to know that this type of meeting has taken a long time in coming. A number of us who have been in and around dance arenas and those who have got close to popular dance culture have been looking for this sort of dialogue to take place. Now that we are here, we have to accept the reality, although we are not condoning drug-taking or saying that anything that happens as a result of the Bill will encourage anyone to take drugs. As we will hear from John Davies and others, why anyone takes drugs in the first place is a very complicated subject. We have reached the point when we can talk about realities so that we are actually talking about something that can make a difference out there—make a difference to the viability of people surviving a drugs-related experience. That, to me, is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
highly moralist viewpoint, which should be applauded. It is a viewpoint that takes strength and courage, but it is based on realities. We are not here to discuss a wish list. We can all wish drugs away; we can pray to whoever we pray to; but the reality is that drugs are here. If we accept and embrace the reality for what it is, we will go some way towards meeting young people half way. If we pay attention to their needs and accept their realities, we hope that that will encourage them to take some responsibility for their actions and health and to think positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask about stewarding. First, the advice from Scottish Drugs Forum is that stewards should have the right to request a search, but an individual can refuse. Presumably, at that stage the person wanting to gain entry to a rave would be excluded. I presume that you would be happy to accept that. Secondly, do you consider that the problem has arisen in the past as a result of people taking drugs before they arrived at raves or taking drugs while at the rave?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willie McBride</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complicated area. It is not simple and I shall not attempt to be simplistic. To explain some of the complications, if we are over-zealous in our efforts to try to stop drugs entering premises a lot of energy will be misdirected. The aim should be prevention. Points have been made about how easy it is to conceal and, thereafter, consume a tablet that is smaller than a fingernail. People are not walking in with big horse tablets the size of a plate. That is not the real world; the reality is that tablets are very small and that drugs come in powder and other formats. If we go down the road of body searching, clearly people will not be put off by efforts to catch them at the door—they will consume their drugs beforehand. That may mean that someone will consume, in one go, the amount of drugs that he or she would have laid out as their party plan for a whole evening. Therein lies a contradiction. We have to get a grip on the situation and talk to young people in terms that will encourage them to speak to us—not talking at them but talking with them. We tell people that if they take ecstasy tablets, they take many risks—the drugs are not legal and there are social and, potentially, physical harms. We ask people to consider taking a quarter or a half a tablet rather than a whole one. Zealous searching can be counterproductive. This is a complicated area—it is not about black and white, but shades of grey, which are the realities of drugs and their availability in our society. We need to leave our wish list on one side and enter the debate with those realities in mind. If we do, we will keep ourselves and young people right. We just want young people to go home safely at the end of the night. That is, I hope, why we are here today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Lee Fawcett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to define recreational use. The individual responsible for dreaming up the term probably feels sorry for having done so because it can be misleading. One could be forgiven for seeing a difference between somebody who has to take heroin every day in order to feel normal and somebody who takes an ecstasy tablet once a month on a night out. There are various shades of grey in between, but you could broadly talk about recreational use when someone chooses to take drugs, rather than having to because they are dependent on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recreational drug use can be a misleading term because it suggests that no problems are attached. Clearly, problems can be attached to occasional drug taking. Everyone on the panel would like them to be reduced and people's drug use to stay within their control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The submission from Crew 2000 gives a clear statement about the difference between recreational drug use and drug-dependent use. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Crew 2000 was established … in 1992 in response to this developing situation as a loose coalition of local young active in the club scene".</p></blockquote>
Crew 2000 deals with people predominantly under 25 with no particular class background, but usually in employment, and who use drugs irregularly, not daily. It would be helpful if you could explain the way in which you deal with those recreational drug users as opposed to drug addicts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Skelton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The group of people we work with would not traditionally approach specialist services. They use drugs and perhaps do not see themselves as having a drugs problem, but they still need information. They are not in contact with the services that can provide them with information and are unlikely to go to a drug agency to get it. In the past few years, Crew 2000 has recruited young people from the club scene who may be or may have been recreational drug users, so they have experience that can be passed on to others. We have put information together in a credible way so that young people will listen to it— written in the same language that they use, with a clear harm reduction message. That information is distributed to places where they would be, so we go into clubs—we work in clubs. In a more discreet way, the information is there if people want to access it. The clear thing is that we do not take a moralistic line—we do not condemn or condone drug use, we give people the facts about drug use. Our service is pure education—young people talking to other young people—which means that people are much more likely to come forward.

As well as working in clubs for the past few years, we have opened a drugs information shop where people can come for drugs information. That has been successful— we have had more than 3,000 visitors in eight months, so there is a big demand for this type of information. It is a question of getting it out to the right places and across the board. I am discussing Edinburgh and Enhance is in Glasgow, but we need information throughout Scotland.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most crucial thing is the credibility of the information. At the end of the day, people have had a lot of messages on what they can and cannot do. It is quite clear that those types of messages do not work. If young people are taking drugs, they need clear, credible and factual information, then their choice is really informed and they can make their minds up. It does not matter what legislation exists to tell people not to take drugs; at the end of the day, they will choose and it is best if they make that choice with accurate information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of the record, will you introduce yourself, Professor Davies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My name is John Davies and I am professor of psychology at the University of Strathclyde. In the psychology department, a group has taken an interest in matters concerning addiction of all kinds—alcohol, drugs, gambling, food and all sorts of things—since about 1970. I have presided over that group for a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a separate section of the psychology department called the Centre for Applied Social Psychology and we do quite a lot of work for the Scottish Office and the Home Office, especially recently in the area of drugs and drugs in prisons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be aware that the Bill that we will consider once we have had the evidence-taking sessions deals with a limited matter—the question of licensing and the authority of licensing bodies. Our questions will be directed at that. I welcome you here, Professor Davies; we know your scope of knowledge and I am sure that what you have to say will be of interest. Who would like to kick off with a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea that young people are doing things when they go to discos seems to have crept up on us. We have all come through that period, which everyone finds difficult, when one is too young to drink officially but one wants something to help the night along, whether in a cafe or a disco. Alongside the worthy notion that the fear of drugs is enough to stop people getting involved with them and that they are something one has to stick
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
into oneself, is the general concern—particularly in Scotland—about the misuse of alcohol and the damage it does to families. Beyond that, there was the concern that one of the reasons that people tended to misuse any substance was because something was missing from their lives; in their homes, for example, or because they had not been provided with enough to do. On a wider social analysis of the issue, why have we suddenly been overtaken by something that we did not seem to be aware of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that we live in a time of rapid technological change. That is a very general answer. Technologies of all kinds are developing and becoming more and more widely available and that includes drug technology. More and more kings of drugs are becoming available on a wider basis. That is happening at the same time as, in my view, there is a bigger difference these days between people like me who are doing quite well and other parts of society who perhaps are not doing quite so well. The most recent data from the Home Office suggests that the distribution of drug use—here I am talking about the recreational drugs that we are concerned with at the moment—over social classes in terms of prevalence of use is more or less uniform. What concerns me is that if one then goes beyond that to examine the kind of use that results in social, health or economic harm, one finds that that is not distributed across social classes. So what seems to be happening is that drugs are serving a purpose for some people which is bleaker, so to speak, than that of others. I imagine that the appeal of drugs from the point of view of young people is very much the kind of appeal that under-age drinking had for me when I was a boy: partly the fact that one is not supposed to do it, partly peer pressure from one's friends—that kind of thing. But as I say, what concerns me is that problem use does not seem to be evenly distributed across the range of social classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a more immediate level, if we are to make progress on the issue, we have to accept that young people use drugs—I do not know how you will take this—on purpose because they like it and because it makes them feel good. That contrasts with the stereotyped notion of drug use and addiction that one often sees in the tabloid papers, where anyone who uses drugs is an "addict" and, as you yourself said, sir, we fear that kind of stereotype.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as the dance scene goes, most youngsters take drugs perhaps to increase their awareness but above all to increase their energy: so that they can stay awake longer. Some people are involved in talking to groups of young people and one of their roles is to educate—and to educate at the point of contact in the dance halls. Do you think that that kind of contact with education helps the situation or does it help to legitimise drug taking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a difficult question. To some extent, it does both things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask myself what Scotland and its drugs scene will be like in 20 years if we have a war on drugs and seek to solve the problem through education and by what I regard as heavy-handed police measures. If we continue in that way, do I think it will be any different in 20 years? Do I think that the war will have been won?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
If I go back to the early 1970s and look at data on the resources used and the education and wars on drugs over that period, I find that they have been accompanied by a steady rise in the number of drugs that are available and in the prevalence of drug use of all kinds. That approach, which is the most obvious one to try, does not seem to me to have produced any impact on the problem. It is impossible to argue only—at best—that it has slowed down the rate of acceleration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we go in a different direction, the chances are that two things will happen. First, drug use will—as you suggested—become, to some extent, more acceptable, in the way that cannabis use is more acceptable in Holland. It is still illegal, but it is more acceptable. Secondly, alongside that, I think that you will be able to reduce the harm that those drugs do. I do not think that you can do the one without the other; both things are likely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With Hanger 13 being in your neck of the woods, you will be well aware that young people go to raves because the drugs are there. It is not as though they go to a dance and some dark, shadowy figure pushes drugs on them that they do not expect or did not know were going to be there. People go to raves because, nine times out of 10, drugs will be part of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to take exception to that point— many people go to Hanger 13 to dance. In the first instance, they recognised that drugs could well be on offer there, but latterly they recognised that they were not, although those people may well have taken drugs before they got there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When Hanger 13 was at its most notorious, you know that busloads of teenagers left Glasgow and were already getting drugs on the bus before they arrived. To address your central point, I think that young people are going to do that. We may not like it, but the kind of harm-reduction strategies that you were talking about—information at the rave, the point of last resort, which says, "Okay, if you're going to do it, then this is the safest way to do it"—is, I think pragmatic. It is unfortunate, but logically, it is the only way to tackle it. It is the only way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to get back to one or two earlier points, you said that part—but only part—of the problem is the greater availability of illicit drugs, particularly illicit drugs that are easy to take because they come in tablet form, as opposed to via needles. I hope that I have understood that correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more specific point, which follows what my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) said, how would you advocate dealing with the fairly obvious problem that although we can pass regulations about raves and the conditions in them, it is rather more difficult to legislate for the young person who goes to a rave having already consumed a considerable dose of illicit drugs? Is there any difference between the psychology of people who take ecstasy, or whatever it is, before going on the dance floor and those who just want to consume it when they get there? How do we as legislators react to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>3.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need to think about that. It is rather an important question. If I were in your shoes as a legislator, which I am not, the guiding principle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
should be to get control of the problem instead of driving it underground by forbidding it. The emphasis is control and regulation, which is not compatible with stamping out. There is an opportunity to try and regulate what is to be allowed at raves. You have to discuss that within your own framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guiding principle would be that too heavy a prohibitionist approach towards the drugs will simply cause the raves to go somewhere else, and the chance to regulate what is happening will be missed. There is an opportunity to control what happens at raves, but if you try to control too much and try to stamp out what I—with respect to Mr. Gallie—regard as the main purpose of a rave, the raves will simply go and be uncontrolled somewhere else. So you have to be quite subtle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the specific question about how you discriminate between people who are intoxicated by drugs before they go to the rave and those who go and subsequently become intoxicated, I do not have any clear idea. It seems to me that the parallel is with a public house. People can get intoxicated at a pub and they can get intoxicated before they go. I leave you to speculate what that would look like at a local level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have picked you up wrongly, but earlier you talked about problem use as opposed to non-problem use. Leaving aside the question of the illegality of some substances, effectively you said that non-problem use was analagous to social drinking. Does that mean that the issue with a drug like ecstasy is more to minimise the conditions that make it potentially dangerous rather than to overstate the question of addiction? You spoke of the concept of problem use versus non-problem use, and your particular experience means that you are not interested in the legality or otherwise of the substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You mean that, rightly or wrongly, I am not interested in illegality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, leave that aside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Profossor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have put the situation very wed.I could not have put it better myself. Data exist to show that large numbers of young people—at all levels, including university students—use illicit drugs from time to time on a fairly regular basis. They appear to suffer no long-term health consequences as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Data on the problem are not all that common, but some American data suggest that students who use drugs cover the whole range of examination results—in just the same way that non-drug using students do. Just as with cars, alcohol, gambling or whatever, a smaller number of people get in a mess. We come to live with that in other areas. Most of us will drive successfully from A to B, and a few of us will die. That is how it works. With alcohol, most of us will control our consumption and enjoy it: a few will fail in that, and the same is true of drugs like ecstasy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, it is my opinion that the attention that has been given is out of all proportion to the mortality statistics associated with that drug.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand you correctly, you are saying that drugs are a fact of life, that they are here and readily available—as they must be if all those university students take them and suffer no harm—and that the legislation should take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, should not the legislation try to control what happens? You are probably old enough to remember the dance halls in Glasgow, Stirling, Dundee and elsewhere. If you were under the influence of alcohol you were stopped from going in. The people inside were all able to dance and enjoy themselves. Drunks were not admitted in the days before drinking became commonplace in most of our ballrooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does something on those lines suggest acceptance that drugs exist, that some people may take them before they go out, but that there is some form of mechanism in legislation that addresses the fact that there are circumstances in which people want to enjoy themselves? Are you saying that if we adopt that, people will go somewhere else? Are people not really there to enjoy themselves? You seemed to disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr when he said that young people did not go to the dance hall to dance, but to get drugs. If that is the case, are we wasting our time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to Mr. Gallie's point, I am a little bit long in the tooth, but a few years ago, I went to some raves in Liverpool and to the Zap club in Brighton, which was quite notorious for a while. My impression was that people went to those places because the drugs were an integral part of that scene. There are other perfectly valid alternative things for people to do which do not involve taking drugs. I do not wish to give the impression that I am saying all young people want to use drugs every time they go out on a Saturday night to dance. I am saying that a significant proportion do at the weekends and we have to accept that that is going to happen and devise policies that will enable us to live with it. If that makes you unhappy, I can understand why but we do not have a choice. I do not think we can legislate it out of existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am also old enough to remember the days when we were issued 50 cigarettes free in the armed forces. The belief then was that all people would smoke and continue to smoke for the rest of their lives. We now know that that was a fallacy. Issuing cigarettes free did not make people addicted to tobacco for the rest of their lives. The education process appears to have had an impact, as it has with drink-driving. Why, then, do we believe that it cannot be achieved when it comes to drugs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The numbers show that since the 1960s and 1970s, 1980s and 1990s there has been a steady increase in young people using drugs. At the present time, according to whose data you believe, in the region of 40 to 50 per cent. of people in their teens will have used an illicit drug at some time or another. A smaller proportion—maybe 20 per cent.—are regular users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You are not asking the question that you seem to be asking. If you give cigarettes to someone who does not smoke, they will not smoke them. Similarly, people who do not want to use drugs will not use drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The vast majority smoked. I was the only chap in my squadron who did not smoke, so I was the only non-smoker out of about 600 people. I am saying that many of those people smoked when they were young but that many of them do not smoke today. That is the result of education. I am putting the question to you: if it worked in the past when the vast majority—not just a substantial number—used to smoke and no longer do, what brought that about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reduction in smoking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, smoking. Is there a lesson there for drugs? They are both addictive, are they not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you well know, it is a success story. It is not clear to me why the reduction in smoking took place: it was perhaps partly due to health education and partly due to the fact that there is a clear and unambiguous health message attached to smoking. What we call the relative risk for smoking is established for lung cancer and heart disease at quite a high level. That is a message you cannot get by. If you talk to young people about the negative consequences of ecstasy, it is difficult, given the present state of knowledge, to be able to tell them something that is credible in terms of why they should not do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly aware that I have not precisely understood the question you are asking me, Mr. Walker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question was quite straightforward. If we accept drugs as a fact of life—which is the message that we are getting—and if we accept that cigarette smoking is a fact of life, given that the pattern of smoking has been changed largely through educative programmes, why cannot we assume that lessons can be learnt about drugs from the tobacco experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point to make is that whilst education is associated with a reduction in smoking, the success of education with respect to alcohol and drugs is very much more qualified. Generally speaking, health education seems to be more successful at providing people with information than it is at changing attitudes or behaviour. That is the case for alcohol and illicit drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point you raised is why can we not get back to the kind of position that we have with smoking. It is simply that all the evidence suggests that the trends are in a completely different direction and that it would be as hard to develop a strategy on that basis as it would, for example, to get people to stop drinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the key to it all. I am old enough to remember that we had cigarettes because we could not do without them. We smoked because of the pressures we were under. That is why I take a cautious approach to people who say that we cannot change behaviour because it is a fact of life. When I was young smoking was a fact of life, and people believed sincerely that nothing could be done about it, so they had to be given 50 cigarettes free—in some circumstances they had free alcohol as well. That was the view taken by all the learned sources at that time and they have been proved wrong. Are there any lessons to be learnt from that about how to deal with the drugs problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be, but then you would have to take into account the fact that over the last two decades we have seen—at different times, in different places and in different countries of the world—substantial amounts of money spent on education and prevention. Throughout that period the trend with drugs has simply continued to increase. To say, "Why can't we get back to what it was?" seems, if you will forgive me, a fond hope. I do not believe it will go back in the box. The evidence, as I say, from past campaigns based on education and prevention suggest that they are of limited effectiveness when it comes to reducing the prevalence of drug use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I challenge a couple of the your comments. You said that young people appear to suffer no ill effects from drugs. You referred to Holland. In fact, Holland is now concerned about the number of small shops selling cannabis and is determined to cut them, if not eliminate them. There were three deaths at Hanger 13 and week after week we hear of deaths due to people taking ecstasy. That cuts across the sentiments that you expressed. I want something along those lines put on record, because I am sure that Dr. Leo Murray will want to pick up on that tomorrow. What is the basis for your comment that youngsters appear not to suffer too many ill effects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look at the evidence from death due to ecstasy. I feel quite strongly about this. A number of police officers up and down the country have described a dance with ecstasy as a dance with death. The actual prevalence of death—if that is the right way to put it; and I am sure it is not—associated with ecstasy is substantially less than death due to cars, death due to alcohol, death due to smoking. That is not to say that each of them is not a tragedy, and data on ecstasy are limited, but let us say that as a maximum there is something like one death per 2 million doses—that kind of thing. For comparison—it is a very silly comparison, but it is just for you to consider—deaths due to an adverse reaction to prescribed penicillin are something like one in 220,000. What I want to say is not that deaths due to ecstasy are not important, but that, by and large, people are, I think, more likely to get run down on the way to the rave than they are to die through using ecstasy when they get there. There has maybe been 50 or 60 deaths in the past five or six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may now come back to something that I do agree with you on, I am intrigued and depressed by the fact that Scotland seems to be over-represented amongst those deaths. If you ask me why that should be, I cannot really give you a very good answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with your characterisation of the Dutch situation, sir. I think that, by and large, the data from Holland show that since the decriminalisation of cannabis—after an initial rise when more and more people wanted to use it because they were interested—there has been a lengthy period of stability. There are downsides to the Dutch system: there are scene areas in Rotterdam and Amsterdam where drug use is endemic and they are not particularly nice places to go. So I agree with you on that. But, generally speaking, the idea that the time has now come to realise that we have to learn to live with this and to regulate it and control it rather than stamp it out, is one I would still stick to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Professor Davies, as you know the Bill deals with health and safety rather than with the wider aspects of raves. I want to seek your views on that, because we have heard differing opinions, even in today's evidence sessions with the voluntary groups. One view is that we should accept the use of drugs because it is a reality, whereas Calton Athletic Recovery Group, which will come before us next, advocates the message, "Just say no. We do not want anything to do with that". So we are in a difficult position when deciding the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read the booklet produced by the Institute for the Study of Drug Dependence on why people use drugs. As you are aware, it is a complex business. The booklet says that it is too simplistic to assume that drug use is a result of drug traffickers and dealers, and that it is largely due to friends and peer pressure. It says that drugs are spread in a friendly and hospitable way, reflecting much wider social change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider our approach to this issue and to the wider issue when putting our message across to the public. What is your advice on the best way to go about that? What subliminal message on drugs should we put across to the public? Should we say, "Just say no. We have a war against drugs and at the end of the day we can win that war", or should we take a more sophisticated approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You raise a fundamental issue. I have been working in this area for a long time— probably too long—and I get very depressed at the way the tabloid press and, frequently, sections of the responsible media treat the drugs issue. It is a serious problem: it ruins numbers of lives each year, but it is not the kind of problem that threatens to undermine society. I do not believe that it is a mediaeval plague or that kind of thing. It is something that we have to learn to live with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would love to see somebody who gave a balanced message on this issue, acknowledging the harm that drugs can clearly do, but also stressing that it is not like the demon drink and we now have the demon drugs. It is something that we can learn to live with and minimise the harm that is done. Specifically, I wish to mention a personal sentiment. One of the things that distresses me more than anything else is the use of the word "addiction" and the way that anyone who uses drugs is said to be an addict. Drug use is tied in with addiction. This is an opportunity to separate them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Guidance is to issue in due course from the Scottish Office. In your opinion, what issue should be highlighted? What themes should be included in that guidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the raves, sir?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing very insightful or novel to offer in answer. Clearly, people need places to chill out—to sit down and have a rest. Clearly, you need water. I think that better guidance on those questions could be had from some of the people you spoke to earlier. They have a better handle on the specific conditions that obtain at raves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main conclusion is that you have to be careful how you deal with the drugs issue so that you do not drive away the animal which you are trying to control. That is my main concern. Obvious matters to consider include water, chill-out areas, ventilation, fire regulations, limits on the number of people who should be there and adequate transport to and from the venue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are over time. Two people want to ask questions. Let us have quick questions and, if possible, short answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must take issue with the professor about the harm to society from drugs. In my constituency, many young people have died, not from ecstasy, but from deadly cocktails of drugs, including temazepam and other well-known substances. I think that that has a lot to do with their poor prospects. They are not young students with a great future before them. They are young people with no futures. What comment would you make about that, in light of the remarks from the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker) about trying to beat drugs eventually? Would changing the economy around and providing employment prospects for young people help to overcome the use of drugs by people who have nothing else to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The realistic goal is not to prevent the use of drugs, but to prevent the harmful use of drugs. That is the position that I wish to maintain. I do not have hard data on the matter, and I do not think that such data exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps you want to know why there is drug use among students and people who are doing quite well as well as apparently problematic drug use in some of the bleaker areas of our inner cities. I do not have scientific data on that, but some years ago we did some work on cocaine use among middle-class professionals. One of the things that enabled middle-class professionals to maintain a professional job and still use cocaine was the fact that their week was structured. As a result, they knew that they had to be straight and sorted out on a Sunday night so that they could hold down the job on a Monday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar data from America on the use of cocaine and other drugs indicate that a style of life to which people are committed, with things that they have to do and want to do, imposes a natural control on drug use. The problem with bleaker areas in America, the United Kingdom and elsewhere is that, without such a structure, Monday is much the same as Sunday. If a person's opportunities mean that life is as good as it gets when he or she has taken some drug or other, and that Monday is just like Sunday, the problem is not that the drug exerts some dreadful compulsion that forces that person to take it but that there is a lack of other reasons and factors to persuade that person not to take the drug.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Govan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pick up your point about the strategy that is required being one of harm reduction? I am worried that harm reduction leads
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
to accommodation, which is non-judgmental, which reduces the barriers to drug taking and which in the longer term effectively encourages more use. I am interested in young people's propensity to take drugs. Is not the atmosphere of the dance scene, which is structured to accommodate drug use, much more likely to encourage more drug use than to inhibit it? Would you accept that? Would you accept that the strategy of accommodation that you suggest is more likely, overall, to increase drug use rather than to reduce it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Professor John B. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are asking me to guess—my guess would be that initially there would be an increase in experimental use by young people and the evidence with cannabis in Holland suggests that that would even out by reaching a peak, falling back and then becoming level. To me, that would be a worthwhile swap because one would be regulating and controlling the use and minimising the harm done. I do not myself see that that is the same as encouraging drug use. With respect to Mr. Walker, what I am saying is that it is going to happen. They are going to do it anyway. That is the world that we and that young people are in and I believe that to be the case. We therefore have to do something about that fact to bring it under control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee, I welcome you to this sitting, Dr. Tannahill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Professor Davies spoke earlier about the harmful effects of drugs. What do you think are the effects of ecstasy and cannabis, which could also be considered as a leisure drug.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly argue that no drugs are without risks. There is a creeping tendency to suggest that certain drugs are a normal and inevitable part of young people's lives. I would challenge those assertions—no drugs are without risks. There can be very direct risks. We have seen fatalities relating to ecstasy, for example, and there are concerns about the long-term effects of cannabis. Drugs also have effects on sexual behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to challenge assertions that some sorts of drug taking are inevitable and normal. We realistically need to make people well aware of the risks and to encourage them to find alternative highs. That said, we must recognise that drug taking will not cease over night and that people will continue to take drugs. There is a place for harm reduction and for a general educational approach that challenges and discourages drug misuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the level of alcoholism in Scotland? That would help to put the debate in context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be too narrow an approach to consider the matter in terms of alcoholism. I presume that you are alluding to the fact that alcohol
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
causes serious harm in several ways. Much of the harm is, however, not caused to people who would be considered alcoholics, but results from situational use of alcohol—in driving and domestic violence, for example. That said, an important point for the health Education Board for Scotland to bear in mind is that we have to address all manner of health-related issues. We must take them all seriously. I get a little concerned when we talk about one issue and then compare it with another. I worry that we run the risk of deflecting attention from the first issue. To say that alcohol causes major and substantial problems would be correct, but equally, we must be concerned about drug misuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You obviously thought of a straw dog to knock down. I was merely making the point that when I ask chief constables about the problem of drugs, although they say that demand for drugs has got out of control and gone beyond their ability to police it, they always seem to refer to the number of people who are known and registered as alcohol abusers in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, which I presume you have read, is all about venues where people may dance and possibly misuse drugs. We heard in evidence earlier that voluntary sector guidelines for all clubs should be improved, so that all environments where people may gather, whether they take drugs or not, will be safer. Do you support that view? Although people may not be taking drugs in those venues, alcohol will be sold in the vast majority of them, as we have heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The guidelines to which you refer, as I understand it, are principally concerned with environments in which illicit drug misuse is potentially or actually a problem. I am glad to see the production of such guidelines. It is important that when people receive advice on what is best for their health and safety, there are environments in which they can carry out that advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the advice is relevant not only to people who take drugs such as ecstasy—for example, the advice to consume water to prevent dehydration when people undertake the sort of prolonged, continuous activity that is sometimes associated with taking ecstasy. I am not aware from my reading of the guidelines that they relate specifically to alcohol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the point, Mr. McKelvey? It seems that we are talking about producing guidelines only for what might be defined as raves. I wonder whether, since you are from the Health Education Board for Scotland, you think that it might be worth producing them for venues in which people might drink to excess or perform movements that could be described as dancing to excess?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have looked at the Bill and at the guidelines on dance halls. I do not feel that I am in a good position to comment on the level of health and safety provision in relation to alcohol. I would have to consider it as a separate topic. I apologise for that. I was not trying to set anyone up as a straw dog. When we deal with the issue of drugs, it is common for people to move immediately into other areas of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you said, Dr. Tannahill, there is no simple solution to the problem. It is manifest in terms that could be biological or a matter of an individual's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
personality or environment. Despite that, the Committee, as politicians, will put out a message to the public just as the Health Education Board for Scotland does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems from the evidence that we have heard today and from written submissions that people divide into two groups. The first accepts that drugs are prevalent in society today, so we must implicitly accept their use and devise harm-reduction methods. The second group says, "Just say no. Have nothing whatever to do with drugs". Would you differentiate between those approaches to dealing with drugs? My learned Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) mentioned alcohol, but what of tobacco and illicit drugs? Would you single out illicit drugs as requiring special treatment and a particular message? Would you have a war on drugs to eliminate them altogether?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Health Education Board for Scotland is pleased to be part of a proposed united and concerted movement against drugs in Scotland. There was a meeting about this at St. Andrew's house two weeks ago. We think that many people in Scotland would like to be in a better position—as families, groups, communities and societies—to reject drugs. If we can have a united movement incorporating many individuals and agencies with a part to play tackling head-on the many problems that the range of drugs creates, we could have society itself saying no to drugs. That would not depend on individuals saying no, but, would be a more communal rejection of drugs as a way of life. At the same time, though, given that people will probably continue to take illicit drugs, we need to make it clear that even though we want a concerted movement against drugs, we are still concerned to reduce the harm caused to people who continue to take them. I emphasise that a national rejection of drugs can and should be combined with an approach to harm reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To press you on that point, if you had to come down on one side rather than the other, would you say that the central theme of a campaign should be a "just say no" message?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not like to come down on one side or the other. The central message behind what I am saying is that we need a united and concerted movement in Scotland against drugs to help groups of people, families and communities resist and reject drugs; but at the same time we must ensure that harm reduction is in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall issue guidance in due course. Are there any particular issues that you would like to see highlighted that would supplement the work of Scotland against Drugs, which, as I understand it, is about changing the attitude of people and gaining community support against drugs at every level with a bottom-up approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may need to look at separating harm reduction from the mass societal rejection of drugs. If we produce materials that will be used by people determined to take drugs in their so-called recreational use and if those materials are predominantly
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
about rejecting drugs, we then run the risk that they will not be read by the people who we want to read them. We need to carefully pre-test materials in those circumstances to ensure that they will be credible and have some impact on people using them. But that should not be construed as acceptance of the use of drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "acceptance" worries me. There is a difference between recognising that drug misuse is a problem that is likely to be with us for a long time and using the word "accepting" about drugs. We should not accept drugs as inevitable. We should challenge that, but we need to recognise that it does go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in your reply to the opening question when you spoke about the need to find alternative highs. You gave that answer to a specific question on ecstasy, but it could presumably be applied to drug taking across the board. I am intrigued by the issue. Obviously, there are differences. People who take ecstasy tend to consider it as a recreational drug. I have more problems in my region with drug cocktails—people mixing anything and everything going. I am interested to know what you think alternative highs might be. It seems to me that an alternative high, which might act as a type of antidote to drug taking or might not allow people to go down the road of drug taking in the first place, would be a hope of getting a job, raising a family and having a decent education. What did you have in mind when you mentioned alternative highs? You must have carried out research, so what would you suggest as alternative highs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly some research evidence that an alternative approach to tackling drugs misuse shows promise. It is not clear from that research exactly what the alternatives might be, but they need to be sustainable. It is important that we do not have short-term initiatives which give people short-lived opportunities which they then find themselves without. Such activities—alternative and productive ways of spending leisure time—are often centred around sports. As I said, it is important that such activities are built into opportunities for young people and that they are sustainable and accessible opportunities, not things which are here today and gone tomorrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards other alternatives to drug misuse, there are several community education provisions which can help. As part of the concerted effort against drugs, we suggest a wide-ranging strategy which would include people in a position to ensure that opportunities exist for young people and, yes, encouraging the business community to pay attention to training and employment provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to draw up regulations around events where drugs are normally used—so-called dances. Many people have suggested that we lay on water and such things. There is physical difficulty with that. Do you think that there should be a limit on the length of time that dances go on? If people do not have the energy to dance the night away, they take something for it. Do you think that there should be a limit, bearing in mind that when that was tried with alcohol, it did not work? Pubs were closed at 9 pm, but people drank all the more. I am not undermining my case, but do you think that there would be any value in suggesting that events start and finish earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all sure. If people were still to take drugs, those drugs would still last for as long as they last. It is very important to examine structural issues such as making sure that water is provided on a free basis in venues. I do not feel especially able to comment on the benefits or effectiveness of curtailing the hours. I find it difficult to predict what exactly would happen were that done. There is always the concern that if opportunities for dancing were cut too much, such activities would move underground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Tannahill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the things that I had in mind when I talked about a concerted drive against drugs in Scotland. We have witnessed changes in climate and culture in relation to aspects of smoking and the social acceptability of smoking. We have seen changes in the social acceptability of drinking and driving. I am not suggesting that drugs are an exact parallel, but we have, I believe, seen a cultural phenomenon in recent times—the movement in favour of drugs misuse. I think we can have a drive against that and can, in time, change society's attitudes to drugs. What is important is that that concerted movement must reach all manner of people. It must be owned by everyone, right across the community. It must not only involve, for example, the Health Education Board for Scotland, but must be able to take off at community level, so that communities that feel despair about the drug situations can be part of the movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you aware that, in his judicial report, Sheriff Gow asked the Scottish Office to implement, through legislation, model conditions for raves? Only 43 out of Scotland's 56 local authorities have byelaws, so the Bill could lead to a situation in which local authorities have byelaws and model conditions only if they wish— some may have them and some may not have them. The Bill might lead to a lack of uniformity of approach in Scotland. Given that, do you feel that it would be helpful if local authorities were mandated to consider model rules and regulations and minimum standards in co-operation with the police, licensees and others in the area so that there was a uniform message throughout Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The relative merits of standards being mandatory or arrived at through consensus are less clear to me. What is important is that a clear lead must be given on what the minimum standards should be. I am not clear as to whether they should be imposed on local authorities, but minimum standards must be set and they must be very clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question on temazepam. There is some evidence that it featured on 800,000 prescriptions legally given by doctors. Do you think that more should be done to give guidance to doctors on restricting prescriptions unless the drug is absolutely necessary for the patient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is clearly a major problem with Temazepam in Scotland. We know much less about the force of such drugs. There is no question but that many general practitioners find themselves under considerable pressure from patients to prescribe drugs where they may not feel particularly inclined to do so. Highlighting that problem and attempting to restrict availability is positive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will have read the Bill. As you come from the background of misuse research, is there any advice you can give the Committee, and are there any lessons—you may think that I am harping on about this— about the way society, and the law in particular, has approached the problems of smoking and drunkenness? If so, is there anyway in which we can link them to what we are trying to do at the moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are good grounds for recognising a link between substances—I know that that is not in direct response to the question as you framed it. It is clear from research that we have carried out at the University of Glasgow that early use of alcohol and tobacco—by early use I mean use by young children—is predictive of later problem drug use, that is, the use of illicit drugs. I think that that suggests the importance of understanding the links between so-called licit drugs and illicit drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to your question, there have been notable successes in changing attitudes towards smoking tobacco. I do not think that that has been equally effective with all sections of the population, but overall we seem to have arrived at a position where a predominantly socially accepted drug is now much less socially acceptable. I think that the combination of measures that have brought that about must be utilised in the case of illicit drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
I do not think that the problem of illicit drugs will be addressed as easily as smoking has been. The fact that tobacco smoking is outwardly very visible is a major difference when it comes to changing attitudes. Nevertheless, there needs to be an attitudinal change from a position where large numbers of people simply accept drugs as a fact of life to one where that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can remember when the pubs closed at 9.30 pm in Scotland and we had drunks everywhere. It was common in the centres of all of our cities and smaller towns to see people who were so inebriated that they could hardly stand. That has gone; we do not see that today. Is there any lesson to be learnt from that? After all, it is a question of how we control—to use a word that has been use by others—the situation. That is what we are attempting to do through the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure that public drunkenness is as rare today as your question suggests. In research that we have carried out among young people, one thing that we have looked at is drunkenness. One concern is that with increasing age—from age 12 to age 15 or 16—one sees increasing drunkenness and drunkenness becoming a majority activity, the overwhelming majority of which occurs outside the home. That is the most worrying setting for the level of drunkenness that we have identified to occur. So I am not so confident that the problem of public drunkenness has been solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

In terms of illicit use, there are enormous challenges on all sides, and we cannot ignore the question of availability. There is legislation that seeks to limit young people's access to tobacco and alcohol and there room for legislation changes to limit that even further. It is clear that some of the barriers to young people's use of alcohol and tobacco are simply not working. That has been shown from the interviews that we have had with young people in Tayside. They have no difficulty in accessing illegal drugs, which is very worrying, especially when we do not understand the nature of the links between the risks of using illicit drugs at an early age to using them at a later age. If we do not know what factors influence that progression, we must be concerned about early use of tobacco and alcohol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have you done any research into the progression from so-called recreational drugs, which are used at raves and so on, to the harder, more lethal drugs, especially in a city such as Glasgow where increasingly people are using a cocktail of drugs? Is there a link or a suggestion that people who take drugs such as ecstasy move on to other things? Do you think that legislation specifically aimed at the club scene is necessary, on the basis that it involved largely so-called non-addictive drugs? Does that suggest a different problem from those associated with the drug addict who has to steal to feed his or her habit and who does not have the money to go to clubs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a problem in associating the dance club culture with the use of one specific drug. It is clear that many who use ecstasy use other drugs as well, both prior to and following such events. Recent research showed that 39 per cent. of a sample of 150 rave attenders had used temazepam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Watson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thirty-nine per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is somewhat misplaced to focus solely on ecstasy because we now know that many of those who use it use a range of other drugs as well. It is also a worrying development in the pattern of use that substantial numbers of people who use ecstasy do not know what is in the drug that they are taking and say that they are not concerned about it. In previous epidemics of drug use, people bought specific drugs because that was what they wanted, but it is a slightly different situation with ecstasy. People buy something called ecstasy but they are not necessarily concerned with what is in the drug. It is clear, too, that the use of that drug is often complemented by the use of other drugs. Therefore, I think that it is misplaced to highlight attention on a single drug.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we should treat users of ecstasy in the same way as users of, for example, injectable drugs. There seems to be a difference in the population of people who use injectable drugs and those using non-injectable drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and in the pattern of drug use. But I am not confident that distinctions that have been mentioned today, such as recreational use and problematic use, have as much weight as we might wish. The use of the term recreational suggests that the pattern of drug use is of little or no consequence, carries little or no risk and is a minor activity. And the use of the term problematic suggests that there is a special area of drug use around which problems cluster and that on the panoply of drug use, one need not be so concerned. If recent events have told us anything, it is that those distinctions are rather outmoded and that tragic consequences can result from a single use of particular drugs. The risks of death and morbidity are much greater than have been suggested by those distinctions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has your centre done any research into drug misuse by primary school children? What can be done to discourage and prevent children from taking to drugs at that young age?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not carried out research in primary schools. It is extremely difficult to inquire into the level of drug use among primary school children. However, we have carried out research on school children from standard one to standard four. It is clear that at S1 a small percentage of children are using drugs and there is quite a large percentage of children for whom drugs are in their social milicu. They are available, even if they have not been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two facts suggest the importance of targeting information and research at the younger age group. You will probably say that that is exactly what a researcher would say, but I do not think that we do very well in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Scotland in terms of research. There has not generally been a clear sighted strategy in terms of research. We have not mounted the sorts of studies that would allow us to speak with the greatest confidence, for example, about the issues influencing young people's use of drugs and the factors influencing progression from the use of one drug to the use of another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the limited prevalence studies that have been carried out, it appears that some young people in primary school are using drugs. We need not only to target attention but to find out what places those young people at particular risk. We are under no lesser burden to try to understand those children who do not use drugs, yet who are living in a situation in which drugs are widely available. We must learn from the experience of those young people. The circumstances of those children who do not use drugs will give us clear insight into preventive efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the issue of who takes drugs and why is complex and that there is no simplistic answer to it. That being so, should we be differentiating between different drug users? I am thinking of those who have a drug dependence and perhaps those who go to raves. Is not the reason why some people who go to raves take drugs a hedonistic one? It is fun; they enjoy it and they do not see anything wrong with it. Is it not incumbent on us, therefore, to take a sophisticated approach to drugs in our message to young people? Is the message just that they should say no, that we are waging a war against drugs and that one day drugs will be eliminated? Or is the message that drug taking is part of our culture for social reasons and that we must take a certain approach to it and accept it? If so, would rave organisers have a certain duty in respect of educational provision and take a stricter approach to raves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As appealing as a simplistic response might be to drugs, it is simply not appropriate. No credible authority would say that one should emphasise one thing against all others, whether that be prevention or harm reduction. I would not seek to suggest that that is less substantial and less awesome than it really is, but the challenges of harm reduction and prevention should be combined. If anything, drug prevention as an issue has been rather eclipsed over the past few years. Clearly, that must change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities that hold raves must understand that they are under an obligation to be concerned about the health and welfare of the people attending those functions. Where people are using drugs, they must be given clear information on the dangers of the drugs and associated activities. One must never give the impression that taking drugs is a minor activity about which one need not be concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doing those two things represents a substantial challenge. If one ever fails to achieve that balance, and gives the impression that drug use is not a significant activity, and that all one needs to know is how to use drugs safely, one does not do well by young people of various ages, the majority of whom are not using drugs. We know from research that, although drug use clearly starts for many people at a young age and becomes a majority activity by the late teens, for all the years up to that point drugs users have not been the majority among young people. One must recognise the responsibility for those who are using drugs and for those who are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Adams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have made the point, Dr. McKeganey, that many young people take ecstasy without knowing what the drug contains. Is that simply because they get most of their information from drug dealers and friends, rather than from official sources? Are we failing to tell them what the drug is and what the effects are?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking of a problem in my constituency, where we have had on sale what are called party packs—packs containing five temazepam tablets and an ecstasy tablet. I can see that because temazepam is a prescribed drug, people have a notion at the back of their heads that it must be safe. Yet they seem to have the same notion about ecstasy, which has never been prescribed—in this country, anyway. Why are we failing so badly to get the message across that those are not recreational drugs? Is it because we have introduced the word "recreational" into the drugs scene? Has that produced a psychological barrier and led people to think that it must be okay to take drugs if one does it for recreation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such terms as "recreational drug use" and "non-problematic use" have not helped matters, because it suggests that a certain level of drug use—which is never specified—and a certain kind of drug use is socially acceptable, or can be carried out with little or no risk. That has certainly not helped matters. Nor are we well equipped to make judgments about how best to communicate with young people on a range of matters, of which drugs is the one that most concerns people here today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking as a researcher, I find it saddening that we have had so little evaluation of drug prevention. To be 10 or 15 years into Scotland's drug epidemic and still not be able to say what works best by way of drug prevention is a pretty lamentable state of affairs. As we do not have that knowledge, all that I can do is offer my best guess at what would work. The consequences are too serious for us still to be guessing at what we should be doing by way of drug prevention. There should be a range of efforts and they should be evaluated. We must find out what works, and at the moment we do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have changes in fashion in drug prevention. People recommend peer education. I do not wish to undermine the arguments that they mount, but we must find out whether it works. It is not good enough to recommend peer education, in the absence of any serious attempt to discover whether it works, for whom it works and in respect of which drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The note on which the professor ended was the point that I wanted him to pursue. Earlier, Dr. McKeganey, you told my colleague, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill, that not enough research had been carried out and that there was not enough information. I am sure that you know that the legislation that we are about to consider is narrow. Are we doing much more in the series of sittings that we are having in Stirling, Ayr and Inverness, than merely letting people speak? Given that we will legislate without the benefit of research—you say that it does not exist at the moment, but it could be carried out—should we not be telling the Government that more needs to be done before we start to legislate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil KcKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not recommend that, although I can see why one might consider it an option. I think it is clearly preferable to try to establish, as far as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
possible, what is going on and to base legislative recommendations, as far as possible, on a clear understanding of what is happening. However, in a situation of some urgency, such as that before us in relation to raves and the association of drug use with raves, one clearly cannot wait for research to be carried out before identifying certain priorities. One of those priorities is the responsibility of those who are organising raves for those who are attending them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can make recommendation in response to that limited problem, but I do not think that anyone on the Committee would feel that the legislative change in relation to the licensing of raves will itself solve the issue of drug misuse in Scotland. It is a limited area of priority, but I think that there are much greater questions to consider such as what places young people are at risk, why they are using drugs and how those individuals who do not use drugs but grow up in areas where drugs are widespread avoid their use?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is an obligation to try to find out what is going on there, and there is an equal obligation to respond to the pressing needs to license raves. So I do not think that there is a conflict there. I certainly would not suggest that one ought to do nothing in the absence of better understanding of what is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From your studies, do you perceive the problem to be much greater in Scottish cities and towns than elsewhere? How do you think Scotland compares with other European countries in that respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In terms of the results of the Scottish crime survey, drug use is more prevalent in inner city areas, but not to the exclusion of rural areas. It appears that drug misuse is less prevalent in rural communities but, nevertheless, it does occur there. I am a member of the prevention working group of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, and I recently looked at the results of the 1994 British crime survey, which contrasted levels of drug use in urban areas and rural areas. The pattern is rather similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question about how Scotland compares to other countries is difficult to answer because there has been very little cross-country research. If you asked me, "How does Scotland compare to, for example, south of the border", I would have to say, "Not favourably". In research that we carried out in Dundee, for example, we tried to identify the rate of uptake, by which I mean the proportion of young people who had been offered drugs compared to those who had used drugs. We contrasted the rate of uptake in Dundee with a study carried out in Manchester, and we found out that Dundee school children were more likely to accept drugs having been offered them than children south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the limited research that would allow one to contrast the situations in Scotland and south of the border, Scotland does not come out favourably in terms of the prevalence of drugs and the rate of uptake among young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
We know that one of the problems of ecstasy is its unpredictability. Scientific evidence from the United States suggests that even one ecstasy tablet could cause irreversible brain damage.

	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you ended your question like that, because that is all I can offer in that respect. I would be cautious in recommending the use of drug-testing kits for the organisers of raves. If they have a place, it ought to be in a rather more controlled environment than a rave and implemented by individuals with a rather different professional background.

	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: About facilities for testing the purity of ecstasy. Should they be in-house, like they are in Holland? Such facilities are available in rave halls so that young people can have their tablets tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Neil McKeganey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am probably not a great deal of help in that respect. I can see the force of an argument for having on-site testing of drugs. However, I have not myself seen any evaluation of that mechanism from the Dutch experience.

	<b>Submission by Calton Athletic Recovery Group</b></p>

	<p>As I understand it amendments to the above bill are being introduced to make drug taking at raves safer where deaths have been caused through heat stroke and dehydration. The amendments will force rave promoters to provide 'cooling off areas for dancers and ensure tap water is freely available at no charge.</p>

	<p>I have grave misgivings over this Bill as it condones, whether overtly or covertly, illegal drug taking. In my view it is a basic acknowledgement that drug taking at raves is now acceptable. This is fundamentally wrong and could create long-lasting damage to many young people who will now view 'recreational' drug use as safe and fun.</p>

	<p>As a recovered drug addict who has worked with other addicts for more than ten years I have been shocked at the amount of young people in the past two years now seeking help at Calton Athletic who started using drugs, particularly Ecstasy, at raves. This is largely due to a pervasive propaganda now being peddled in the youth media and culture that doing 'E' at the weekends is okay.</p>

	<p>Drug use in the early stages always has a 'honeymoon' period where it is enjoyable. But this soon wanes and the search for increased use of a drug can then lead to tremendous problems for the individual, family and friends and society. Tragically this is now proving no different with Ecstasy. However all of this is not known to the youngster who naively seeks to be one of the crowd and join in drug-taking as a rebellious bit of fun.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>

	<p>Drug taking is very much a 'peer group' activity— all research acknowledges this. What we should be doing is trying to use that peer pressure to STOP people using drugs.</p>

	<p>I am aware that no law can stop drug taking but that is a million miles away from introducing new laws that condone drug use as these amendments do. Society has to take an honest stand on the use of drugs. It is either for or against. There is no halfway house and I am afraid this Bill, if passed, will send out a very clear message to youngsters that the law will now provide a safe environment to take drugs.</p>

	<p>The long term damage this could cause is unthinkable.</p>

	<p>David Bryce, Project Leader; Mr. David Main, Deputy Project Leader; and Ms Lorraine Fraser, Female Co-ordinator, Calton Athletic Recovery Group, 
	<i>called in and examined.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Calton group is against the Bill because it recognises the fact that youngsters take drugs. I certainly do not want to legitimise drug taking by testing in rave venues, but the security measures and other aspects of the Bill will help to keep drugs out of clubs and other dance halls. On that basis, is not the Bill worth some support from your organisation, which I greatly respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We give the Bill some support, but it is an incomplete Bill—for instance, free water should be standard in any dance hall or it should not have opened in the first place. A chill-out area should never be called a chill-out area because that implies that it is okay and there is somewhere for you to go when you are full of drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been spoken about ecstasy. Much has not been spoken about the fact that 92 per cent. of the people who take ecstasy take other drugs, so it would not do much good to try and test the quality of their ecstasy when they are in the business of taking other drugs as well. We are giving out mixed messages: that it is okay to come to raves to take drugs in the chill-out area; that it is okay to take heroin if you are 16—we will give you a methadone substitute—but we will jail people who smoke hash. Hash is not killing people. Ecstasy is killing people, heroin is killing people and methadone is killing people, yet somehow we are legitimising them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If only it was always so simple. When I was young, we had a massive problem in the dance halls, as we then called them—now they are rave venues. The massive problem then was people getting stabbed, slashed and murdered, but we did not come up with a solution of building wee operating theatres in the dance halls, so someone who was stabbed could be stitched up pretty quickly. What stopped people carrying knives into the dance halls, or carrying them outside—I know how effectively it was done, because I was part of that culture during the 60s—was the deterrent of imprisonment. That calmed things down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the past 10 years, we have gone down the road of legitimising everything, without looking at the facts. A lot has been said about ecstasy, but nothing has been said about HIV and ecstasy. They are not forthcoming about the extent of the HIV problem in Glasgow; but they are forthcoming about the heterosexual group having seen the biggest increase in HIV infection. That heterosexual
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
group attends rave venues where the so-called designer drugs make kids sexually active and promiscuous. In there, nobody talks about HIV—they are still dwelling on the needle. They still assume that Glasgow has 10,000 injecting addicts, which is not true and never has been. All the injecting addicts have probably been seduced into services by the introduction of methadone, yet that seduction only reached 2,000. I think that that is closer to the mark than 10,000. There are certainly more than 10,000 people in Glasgow who use drugs, but they mainly use the so-called designer drugs or safe drugs. But those drugs are not safe—they are a cocktail of drugs, as Irene Adams correctly pointed out earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Kids do not stick to ecstasy—it has been quoted that roughly 92 per cent. use other drugs. I would not disagree with that. The reason why the other 8 per cent. do not use other drugs is that they are still in the honeymoon period that everyone has with drugs. When you take drugs, you unfortunately feel good at first, but the honeymoon period ends quickly for some people—maybe even after their first attempt. For others, the honeymoon may last a few months. Then they all do the same thing as the drug addicts they look down on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a social structure among drug users: the ecstasy mob and the coke mob look down on the junkies, but the junkies are laughing back, saying "We'll see you next year". That is what is really happening. I am here to talk not about research in Holland or America, but about real, live research in Glasgow. We have been working with people there for the past 10 years. The news about ecstasy was no surprise to us, because we have been dealing with the casualties for the past three years, and maybe longer. There are very few casualties coming out of the rave scene—maybe a few deaths. The real casualties are occurring away from the rave scene, in the psychiatric hospitals, in addiction and in prostitution. It is the same natural progression that goes on everywhere drugs are taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our school drug prevention workshops is called "Cannabis to Chaos". That title may be outdated now, and we should change it to "Ecstasy to Chaos". That is what is happening now—kids who have never even smoked cigarettes or dope are going straight to a class A drug, because of the media propaganda. Some researchers are even saying that it is cool. But the things we said four or five years ago have all come true. It gives me no satisfaction to say that. Everybody assumes that young people will take drugs anyway, but that is trite defeatist and nonsense. If it were true, we would not have young people doing the research with their feet, marching through our doors because they are having problems with the so-called designer drugs—the safe drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure that their questions will stimulate questions from other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Bill will be enacted in one form or another, what amendments do you think we should be considering? What duties should organisers and local authorities have? Your message, if I understand it correctly, is, "Just say no". If so, what is the best way to create a drug-free zone in raves? Would it be best to use drugs tests, education or the imposition of obligations on rave organisers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will not make impositions on local authorities; it is up to those authorities to decide one way or another. Should local authorities have to produce byelaws and model conditions relating to raves in particular locations? If there are model conditions, what minimum conditions should apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think people should just say no; they need clear reasons to reinforce any decision. I spoke about various measures in that introduction to that statement. There are people who want to do drugs and who are involved in the concern of drugs at venues; one has to come down with the full force of the law to deter other people. In a way, that is what stopped the heroin explosion in the city about 10 years ago. The only problem is that it has shifted down to the gaols. The dealers with the big sentences went on the roof and took hostages. That seemed to have some effect, because the visiting arrangements were made easier. Heroin was taken off the streets. After that, people resorted to prescribed methods. It changed the way that people who peddle drugs act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People talked about schools; if people loiter in schools, they deserve the full consequence of the law. The authorities must try to get a rest room or chill-out area, but they must make sure that people only come in under the influence of drugs or carrying drugs. We can impose a certain amount of discipline to get out from the people who attend exactly what they are up to. If it is a venue, it should be a safe venue; it might be a supervised venue perhaps with stewards. That is not asking the impossible. We can do those things at other venues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not naive enough to think that the information will always have an effect on people who are intent on enjoying themselves. I will merely await until those people start to suffer the effects that are commonplace; there are notorious effects on everybody. The idea that people can take half an E and be okay is wrong; half an E becomes an E after a couple of months, and then it becomes two Es. The Government say that they will be firm and that no one will stand idle while people make thousands of pounds out of other people's misery— particularly from young people. People see only the bright side of the drug, not the depressions or mood swings, or that tolerance builds up. People who take ecstasy tend to take other drugs, and they take a cocktail of drugs. For me, the deterrent is for the ones who want to break the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been reading your statement, David, which says that 34 per cent. of those youngsters who said that they had tried drugs had done so as an experiment, but only 4 per cent. enjoyed them and only 5 per cent. were experiencing personal problems. What conclusions does Calton Athletic draw from those responses? Would you support especially tough legal action against people selling drugs in the vicinity of schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no problem with that. If I was involved in the sale of drugs, I would expect the full consequences of the law to come down on me. I am not involved in selling drugs, but I see a lot of people who are. The full force of the law is not coming down on them. It is being held back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The research in front of you is us proving something that we have always believed—that peer pressure takes people into drugs. There is trouble in understanding what peer pressure is. The media describe it, but are not sure what it means. Some people think that peer pressure is having your arm twisted up your back by the rest of your peers so that you then take a drug. But peer pressure is a lot more subtle than that. Once peer pressure influences people to take drugs they are enjoyed—that is why people take them again. In all the years I have been working with people in recovery, I have heard very few, if any, blame the poor social conditions of their mothers and fathers. They know what took them into drugs—naivety, peer pressure and because they thought they could control it. Once they passed the honeymoon period, they discovered that they could not. There is no big sign telling youngsters, "You are now entering addictions". They do not find that out until they try to stop and realise that they are dependent and that it is controlling them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You said that you had problems with the idea of tougher action against people selling drugs in school areas. Why is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no problems with that—quite the opposite. Other people may have no problems about dealers selling to kids in schools and kids in dance halls. Kids at under-age raves want to do what older kids are doing. Some might be a bit more adventurous—get themselves done up and look old for their age. Do not be fooled into thinking that kids at under-age raves just want to enjoy the music. They want to participate fully, just like older ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gallie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Maryhill talked about drug dealers near schools. You extended that to raves. My view is that drug dealers, wherever they are, should be hammered into the ground. Would you say that there should be different rules for those selling drugs around schools and for those who do so away from school areas, or should the rules apply to all drug dealers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Across the board. Why distinguish if they are killing people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification. The way in which you are presenting the case seems to imply that any drug use will automatically lead to addiction. Is that the case? If not, can you distinguish between drugs that are less dangerous and those that are more dangerous? The way you are talking makes it sound as though any drug use leads to addiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I made that clear in my first answer. We are talking about safe drugs, including ecstasy. We are dealing with drugs that do not kill, but the kids taking drugs that do not kill experience the same consequences of the law as those taking other drugs. It is okay to take heroin, because at 16 we will give you methadone. Not only will we give you methadone but we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
will do something more for you than for other kids. We will introduce you to sickness benefit at 16 to 17. A kid not taking anything will not get that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything is geared up to the ones who want to use and abuse the system. People want to provide lots of chill-out areas for people taking ecstasy, which is a class A drug. But if you smoke cannabis, we will bust you. Kids who smoke cannabis are already illegally smoking tobacco. I think that you have to be 16 to smoke tobacco. They have to smoke tobacco before they smoke cannabis, and they are more likely to die from tobacco than cannabis. There have been no recorded deaths from cannabis. I do not know of any HIV cases from it. But it is illegal. Young people are in reality doing nothing because smoking of any kind probably stunts their growth and probably leads to cancer, although it may take 30 years to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference, but the Government cannot see it. They say that kids start on cannabis and move on to other things, but kids who started on ecstasy have moved on to other things much more quickly. Kids who smoke cannabis will come into contact with people who sell heroin and ecstasy, and if they come into contact with those people, they will be susceptible to suggestions— "That is kids' stuff; why not try this?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find Mr. Bryce's remarks a breath of fresh air. It always worries me when people come to give us advice and, at the end of the day, I am more anxious than when we started. You seem to have a clear view that the matter can and should be addressed and that, although it does something, the Bill does not go far enough because it does not cover a sufficiently wide area. From your 10 years' experience you seem to be convinced that if we tackled the problem properly, we would contain the problem of drugs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we come up with a solution and tackle it properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see people here today whom I respect and have known since way back. I do not blame the politicians; they are the elected representatives of the country. I blame the people who advise politicians, who are perhaps giving the wrong kind of advice. Politicians act on that advice. It may be wrong, but it is the advice that the political masses are receiving. I believe that in my heart and soul.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who are against us think that I am only talking for a certain few, but I make my statements in places like Carstairs, Shotts prison and Dumfries and Polmont young offenders institutions, and in the streets of the east end of Glasgow. No one ever tries to shout me down because they know that I know my subject, and they know where I have been. Many of them would like to be where I am sitting today. Mine is a credible message and, to prove that that credible message works, 90 per cent. of the people who come to Calton Athletic are self-referrals. The people on the street, whether they are stupid, naive or daft, know exactly where to head to when they are serious about doing something for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the projects and services involved, it is sad that 90 per cent. of people have to find their own way to Calton Athletic. It is very sad that the biggest statutory referral agency to the club is Monklands district hospital, which refers more people to Calton Athletic than the whole of Greater Glasgow health board and Strathclyde
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
regional council put together. Strathclyde regional council and Greater Glasgow health board partly fund the project, but I suggest that Monklands refers so many people because of the co-operation in Monklands. Once we had spoken to people at the hospital, we had no problem convincing the secondary schools in Monklands that we should go in and talk about prevention. A lot can be achieved through co-operation, but unfortunately, for the past 10 years, we have had to find every resource to show that something works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does work. If it did not, I would have been wasting my time. If other people want to put their time into helping people who do not want to help themselves, that is fair enough, but I am asking the Government to redress the balance and resources. I say from my heart and soul that if 98 per cent. of resources are spent on treating people who are on drugs, nothing will be changed. That leads to a sort of peer pressure. Certain young people who leave school with no jobs or benefits can say that they use drugs and get a prescription and sickness benefit. But take them out of that scenario, when they are getting no benefits, and they will be dying because they have been guided towards that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Getting access to the people we could influence most. I believe that changed last week when we got the support of the director of Strathclyde regional education department at a school presentation we did. I knew before we did the presentation that anybody who had seen it would support it. Any criticism that has been made of it has come from people who have never seen it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to open the doors to the most vulnerable people and get our message to them not just about saying no, but about why they should say no. What we are speaking about in our workshops is already reality to some young people. Young people who take drugs are on a journey and I firmly believe they do not have to stay on to the terminus. We have got a method of prevention. It would be stupid or naive to think that prevention did not include drugs. Most kids who already take drugs went to a school where they thought it was compulsory to smoke dope. Most of them, like other young people, are experimenters. If they come to Calton Athletic, the same rules apply to them as apply to the big 'uns. We say, "If you want to mess about, go somewhere else. If you want a platform and a safe place, it's here where you can develop yourself and achieve things". The first question is, we need the resources and we need to open doors to get to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
the most vulnerable people. Sooner or later, we may have to prioritise because the demand will be to big. We have got to stop the young ones. I believe they can be stopped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I thank you for your statement, which we all read with interest? You say that you oppose the Bill because it will send out a message to youngsters that the law will provide a safe environment for taking drugs. Your message is, do not take drugs at all. That reflects what Dr. Andrew Tannahill was trying to say about the culture of being against drugs. In an environment in which such emphasis is placed on getting bevvied on a Saturday night and so much violence and mayhem is cause by drink, do not young people think adults a little hypocritical? We have a drink-based culture. Perhaps they do not want to get bevvied and stoned on vodka or whisky, but we are telling them not to take their pleasures. How can those messages be pulled together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not go to a rave venue or to a pub to try and convince them, although I am quite sure that the young people I deal with have been at both. We get them in our own environment to do it. Maybe they have got a point about older people, but the solution is not to take something that will kill you quicker and maybe give you a terminal illness. It is no solution to say, "Drink's naff, this is cool". I think cool is getting a chance to live and a chance to achieve things. I think that people who take drugs stop achieving things and stop developing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not go to a rave venue to get a message to kids who are going to try drugs or jump into a pub and try drink. The time to speak to them is when they come out of the pub. They know that if they finish up in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
psychiatric hospital or on some form of treatment, they will not enjoy themselves. Very little can be achieved at a rave. They just tear up any information that you give out and put into the joints that they are smoking. That is what I think.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do you believe that facilities such as chill-out areas and the provision of water are raves regulated by local authorities condone the use of drugs by accepting that it happens? Are you saying that you would rather that none of that was provided because that would make our hostility to the use of drugs clearer by making no accommodation for it? I am not sure how your evidence gels with some of the other evidence that we have heard. What is your view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Bryce</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those things that you spoke about were always in dance halls. Certainly, when I went to dance halls there was always water. Even if you took no interest in drinking, there was always water there and there were always areas off the main dance floors, like the Denniston Palais or the bar lounge, where you took your lumber and different things. It was cooler than up on the dance floor and quieter. Those things were always there. Why do we have re-invent the wheel? If those facilities are not there, the venue should not have opened in the first place. We have to go a lot further than just saying that there is chill-out area and free water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
