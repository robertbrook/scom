	<div class='legislation'>Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Oil and Chemical Pollution of Salmon and Migratory Trout) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Rod Richards)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Oil and Chemical Pollution of Salmon and Migratory Trout) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The order prohibits fishing for salmon and migratory trout in the area designated, which covers specified rivers and streams in the counties of Dyfed and West Glamorgan. The principal rivers affected are the Solva, western and eastern Cleddau, Taf, Tywi, Gwendraeth Fach, Gwendraeth Fawr and Loughor. The order covers all rivers and streams that reach the sea between St. David's Head and Port Eynon-Point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that following the Sea Empress oil spill, we had hoped to secure a prohibition on salmon and sea trout fishing by means of a voluntary ban. That turned out to be too complicated—too many interests were involved and not all could be reached. Therefore, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Wales introduced this order as a precautionary measure, to ensure that consumer safety was secure at the start of the fishing season that opened on 20 March. The order prohibits the taking of salmon and sea trout known as sewin, in those areas and their movement, supply, and sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the frustration and concern of hobby and leisure fishermen that the ban has been imposed. It has been said to me that we could have introduced other arrangements to protect human health, but in any arrangements other than through statutory restriction, some risk would have remained and that was not acceptable. For example, we could not be absolutely sure under a catch-and-release scheme that some fish would not have ended up on the table in a local restaurant. Furthermore, we know that a catch-and-release scheme would be difficult to enforce and to police—loopholes would have continued to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another alternative would have been to postpone the start of the fishing season. We thought of that, but any such change would have meant the introduction of new byelaws by the National Rivers Authority. Hon. Members will appreciate that when I refer to the NRA, I am, since yesterday, obviously talking about the Environment Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister referring to the whole length of the rivers back to their sources and the streams that feed them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am referring to the entire lengths of all of the rivers. The introduction of new byelaws involves elaborate procedures for advertising and periods for objection. There was no time to go through that process. This was an emergency incident, and only emergency powers ensured the quick and secure arrangements that we needed to be put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did we wait until 20 March to introduce those arrangements? We knew that there was a possibility that the upper reaches of rivers might require protection. We spoke to the NRA about that, and the view at that time was that a voluntary arrangement with the co-operation of fishing interests could be secured, at least until sampling could be arranged and assessed. At that time the fishing season had not started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it has taken time for scientific results to become available. Catching salmon and migratory trout for laboratory analysis proved difficult because it was early in the season. Few fish enter rivers in the spring, and the unseasonably cold weather meant that even fewer were available. The first samples were caught on 21 March by the NRA, which has been assisted by the guidance and expertise of local netsmen who have fished the rivers for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Preliminary results of tests on salmon and sea-trout samples from the Cleddau and Taf rivers are now available, and I am encouraged by early indications. I cannot and will not make a commitment to lift restrictions on freshwater fishing soon. However, results of hydrocarbon testing so far show only low levels of contamination. There is need for further work and for more samples to be taken and tested, but we hope that the ban will be short-lived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the economic value of the fisheries to the area. Anglers, fishery owners and others want to ensure that restrictions are lifted as soon as possible. However, they also value the deservedly high reputation of fishing in the area. I am sure that they would agree that the ban should be removed only when we are certain that no danger exists and that the reputation for fine-quality, safe fish is vindicated. Clearly, they are worried about loss of income. They have taken the initiative of setting up a claims panel to represent their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Minister's opinion, or that of his scientific advisers, what hydrocarbon levels constitute a risk to health—which is the subject of the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows the answer because he served on the Committee that considered the sea fisheries order, and he was also a member of the Select Committee that discussed the same question. The Government take advice from scientists, who do not quantify milligrams per kilogram of hydrocarbons in any species of fish. Therefore, the test for the quantity of oil is rather subjective. There are also tests for tainting. They will be conducted soon, and I am optimistic about their results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Win Roberts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, my hon. Friend referred to low levels of contamination in fish that were caught on 21 March. Does not that mean that the level of hydrocarbons in the fish is higher than it would have been if the Sea Empress disaster had not occurred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend asked a good question. I stress that only a small sample of fish was caught on 21 March. The hydrocarbons found in them show no trace of Forties oil, but that does not mean that we can lift the ban immediately. We must take further samples before we can be certain that the fish are not contaminated. However, I am reasonably optimistic that the order will be revoked in the not too distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that a claims panel is the right way for persons connected with the fishing industry to proceed, who will get expert advice. I assure them, and hon. Members, that we will do all that we can to ensure that restrictions are lifted as soon as possible. However, the safety of public health is paramount. We will remove restrictions only when health and fishery scientists advise that fish from the area are safe to eat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to trouble the Minister again, but I am unclear about the matter. What is polluting the fish if they show no sign of Forties field oil? If it is another, indigenous pollution, why was not fishing banned previously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was no sign of Forties oil in the small sample taken but the hon. Gentleman must bear in mind that at this time of year, migratory fish do not feed as they approach their freshwater rivers. We must wait to be absolutely certain that we have got it right. I make no apologies for progressing cautiously because, as I said, of paramount concern to the Government is the potential hazard to the consumer of eating tainted fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at how relaxed the Welsh Office—or the Environment Agency, National Rivers Authority or whatever public body is involved—is being about taking samples. The spillage was in mid-February and the date of the first sample is 21 March. I should have thought that there would be daily sampling from a variety of sites to discover what is happening, in view of the importance of the multi-million pound leisure industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman's scientific background, he obviously knows nothing about migratory fish. I should like him to tell me where one could catch a salmon or a sewin in February, as they come up river only in spring. Experienced local anglers have to date managed to catch only a small sample. It is not a matter of the Government being relaxed, but of trying to catch fish out of season. Although the tests so far show low hydrocarbon levels, more detailed tests are being made, and we must move cautiously because public interest and public health are at stake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition welcome the opportunity to discuss the order, why it has been made and how soon we may reasonably expect it to be revoked when the all-clear is given. I shall follow the Minister's practice of using the better-known Wenglish name sewin, rather than migratory sea trout. Sewin tastes much nicer than sea trout, although they are identical in all respects—except that sewin are caught in Wales and sea trout in England, as you, Mr. Hill, will be aware, as a Hampshire Member of Parliament. As a member of Anglers Anonymous, I am sure that you welcome this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a conflict at the heart of the Government's approach to the matter, which was revealed by the Minister on the Floor of the House, and it relates to scientific evidence. The Minister referred to a seafish and shellfish exclusion order, in a debate in the Chamber on 20 March. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As I have already explained, such an order can be made only on the basis of scientific evidence and in the interests of the public or the consumer on health grounds. It cannot be made on any other grounds."</p></blockquote>
He said earlier:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has been put to me that the designated area"</p></blockquote>
—for the seafish and shellfish exclusion order—
	<br><blockquote><p>"should have been extended"</p></blockquote>
into Cardigan bay, the subject at issue—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for a short period so that the testing regime could have cleared the area not actually affected by the spillage. That would not have been legally possible."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 March 1996; Vol. 274, c. 439–440.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister seems to be stating that he cannot make an order unless there is evidence that food is unsuitable for human consumption. In a way, he is now saying the reverse—that he cannot fail to make an order unless he is sure that food from the area is not satisfactory for consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental conflict between the two philosophies of the function of scientific evidence. If there is no scientific evidence that the food is affected, does one make or not make an order? The Minister said that there is no scientific evidence that the fish have been affected by pollution from the Sea Empress but that the order has been made in case the fish should show evidence of hydrocarbon pollution at more than background level, or of pollution from a specific source—the Forties oilfield diesel from the Sea Empress—when they are eventually tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have such evidence, so what is the legal basis of the order? On 20 March, talking about the sea fish and shellfish order, the Minister said that it was not legally possible to make an order unless there was scientific evidence of pollution. I hope that the Minister will address that problem. It is like the bovine spongiform encephalopathy scare. Can cow meat or prime beef be banned from the food chain without supporting scientific evidence? The Secretary of State for Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had exactly the same problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government need to be on a firm legal footing, not to be open to challenge. Is scientific evidence needed before material—be it shellfish, migratory fish
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
or beef—can be debarred from the food chain? Could any farmer or fisherman go to judicial review and say that the scientific evidence that was said in the House to be necessary had not been forthcoming? According to the Minister this afternoon, the scientific evidence is a subjective matter—the scientists must advise the Minister, who then takes the political decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that we have got to the bottom of exactly what scientific evidence would justify the Minister's decision. In the debate on the previous order, he referred briefly to the present order. Although it was not debated, it was touched on because it had been made the previous day—the first day of the fishing season, as the Minister said. He said that order was based on the precautionary principle and was made in case the scientific evidence of pollution by oil from the Forties oilfield or by diesel from the fuel tanks of the Sea Empress should eventually emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that at least one fish had been caught. I am not sure whether that means one salmon or one sewin, or perhaps more than one fish. It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us how many fish of the salmon and sewin species had been tested so far, so that we could judge how satisfactory are the samples on which are based the reassurance—it is not legal reassurance about the making of the order but, if anything, the reverse—that we do not yet face a serious problem with salmon and sewin pollution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that the fish are not in feeding mode but in spawning mode when they enter the rivers. Any pollution that the fish absorb is not a result of their eating polluted plankton or other microorganisms further down the food chain, because they do not eat anything at all. Their mind is solely on one thing. They can therefore absorb pollution only through the skin or gills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hargreaves 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hall Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to trespass on any ground that my hon. Friend the Minister might want to cover but I imagine that, depending on tide and weather conditions and how long any migratory salmon might be in Cardigan bay or the surrounding areas, there must be some concern that they are still feeding on crustaceans before coming up the river. There must be some scientific concern that oil might enter the food chain at that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my understanding, but I am happy for the Minister to correct me at the end of the debate if I am wrong. My understanding is that they are on a spawning run which is not only from when they enter. However, I am no scientist and I have not been a fisherman since I was 17 years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned catch and release which is a common practice among fishermen, even those fishing for gain. The reason he gave for not wanting to permit catch and release needs to be expanded. We need to know why it is regarded as unsatisfactory. He may say that it is better to have a complete ban so that the water bailiff can approach anyone he sees fishing
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
who cannot use the excuse that he was going to put them back in anyway. That is a standard problem in the regulation of all fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The angling clubs that control fishing and pay big sums of money—£10,000 or £12,000 for a little run and sometimes much more for a mile on the banks of the Tywi for example—do not mess about when they are regulating their activities. The response to the question "What about the poachers?" is that poachers will not listen to the order either. They are completely outside regulation. A poacher is caught because he does not have a licence to be there, not because he is not participating in a catch-and-release scheme. We need further clarification about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the order cover other migratory species such as eels which are found in these rivers? There may be other species such as lampry and shads. How do we get round the problem of the NRA water bailiffs and the netsmen who are participating in the scientific exercise? If a netsman is down there at three in the morning trying to help the scientific exercise he might also be catching fish. How can we be sure that he is helping the NRA and not catching fish for a local hotel? If he catches two salmon he may give one to the NRA and the other to the hotel in the time-honoured manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Has it occurred to him or to his party's press office to issue copies of some of his concerns about fishermen going for judicial review to a guide reviewed in last weekend's papers called "Where to fish in Wales" which is published in this month's 
	<i>Trout and Salmon</i> magazine? Does he feel warnings about judicial review would go down well with the supplement to that magazine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that is material to the proceedings on this order because I am not sure what point the hon. Gentleman was trying to make. Perhaps he meant that it was a matter for the Wales tourist board to take up with the NRA or Welsh Water. Perhaps he will catch your eye, Mr. Hill, and make his point at greater length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given my list of questions that I should like the Minister to answer. Many people in west Wales, having been hit by the orders excluding beef, shellfish and now salmon are wondering whether all that they can eat is lava bread. That is probably out as well. Gull's eggs are the other traditional peasant food of west Wales and they are probably out, too. People will wonder what is left for them to eat safely. I hope that these problems will be solved in a few months' time. If there are suggestions I am sure that they will come from the very creative minds assembled on the Back Benches here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask one question about the designated officers who will police the order. Will it be the water bailiffs, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West Mr. Morgan suggested? The area is large, as the Minister knows,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
and extends from the Solva all ther way up past the Tywi, the Gwendraeth Fach, the Gwendraeth Fawr an the Loughor. The Minister knows the area well. Can he tell us how many water bailiffs there are to police the area? Is he proposing an increase in their number in view of the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.56 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall also be brief, as most of the important points have been covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West. It should be put on record that this is yet another impact of the Sea Empress disaster. The impact is now spreading significantly far inland, especially along the Tywl and its tributaries. Most of the rivers that feed into the area to which the existing order applies are relatively short, but the Tywi is a long river and the economic impact, as well as the environmental impact, is spreading a long way from the area that is recognised as being severely polluted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the question of compensation—which I know is not directly related to the order. I hope that the Government are using their offices as participants in the international oil pollution compensation fund to make it clear that, as a result of the order, the economic impact has spread a considerable distance away from the coastline. The compensation fund and the insurers should bear that in mind when considering claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be another problem, of which I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) is well aware, in relation to the earnings—let us put it no more strongly than that—of the coracle fisherman on the Tywi. It is a problematical fishery and it is difficult in any case for the fisherman to make a living, but the order has hit them severely. I hope that the Government are making it clear to the compensation fund that it should treat any applications from those fisherman as sympathetically as possible, bearing in mind the problems tht they may have in accounting for their earnings in previous years and seasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West described well the fundamental issue of the difference between the ways in which the Minister has interpreted the need for the present order and that for the previous order covering the area below mean high water mark between Worms head and St. David's head. The nonsense is that fin fish travel considerable distances in the Irish sea and through the western approaches—tagging by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has proved that they travel many hundreds of miles—and the orders allow a commercial fisherman operating out of Fishguard or Aberystwyth to catch a migratory fin fish in Cardigan bay and sell it without any problem whatever, even though it may have spent the previous few weeks, or longer, in a heavily polluted area. No action will be taken against the fisherman, even if the fish is tainted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that fish do not recognise prohibition order boundaries. Many fish that have swum through the polluted area will be landed. The same applies to
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
fish caught by south-west English fishermen working out of Newlyn and other ports. Polluted fish will not be removed from the food chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West made it clear that migratory salmon and trout are likely to spend only a short time passing through the polluted offshore area before moving into the rivers and streams. The Minister said that scientific evidence showed no trace of hydrocarbon in fish caught on the 21 March—a month after the Sea Empress disaster, when extremely heavy pollution occurred offshore. I believe in the precautionary principle—and I berated the Minister for not exercising it when the Sea Empress first ran aground and spilt 70,000 tonnes of oil around the shore of my constituency. The Welsh Office was dilatory in imposing an order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious from the Braer disaster that such large oil spillages cause heavy pollution, and that making an order as quickly as possible is in everyone's best interests—including those of fishermen. However, a month after the major spillage, tests on migratory salmon showed no signs of pollution. I accept that the sample was small, but I assume that those fish were among the first to come through the polluted area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hargreaves</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if there is good, fresh water of a suitable temperature, migratory salmon will move straight from the bay into the river system, but that if the water level is low, and there is not much rainfall—there has been little rain for the past week or two—they are likely to spend longer in the bay before journeying upriver? If only two or three fish have been tested, the Minister has no proper sample to go on. Those fish might have passed through the bay at a time of heavy rain, when fresh water came into the estuaries. When fish smell fresh water, they spend no time in the bay. In dry, sunny weather, the water in rivers drops and fish wait for the next major flow of fresh water before moving. They may spend much longer in the bay. Scientists may worry that the fish could thus become polluted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but in the case of Milford Haven and eastern and western Cleddau, we are considering a huge area, not simply an estuary, and a vast quantitiy of water. Only an incredibly sensitive salmon could decide at the mouth of Milford Haven that high levels of rainwater were flowing down the eastern or western Cleddau, 20 miles away. I accept that fish may not move because of relatively low rainfall, and the hon. Gentleman is right to say that we have just experienced such a period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, our debate is about two orders. We were told that we had to wait until we had received all the scientific evidence before the first order was imposed because it was so draconian. The gut reaction was to say, "For goodness sake, do it as soon as possible, restore order and don't depend on a voluntary ban imposed by the fishermen on the offshore fishery." We knew from incidents such as the Braer disaster that the spillage was likely to have a major impact quickly. It was surprising that the Welsh Office did not exercise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the precautionary principle immediately and impose an order, as the Scottish Office did within 77 hours of the Braer running aground. That order had to be extended later when the scientific evidence was produced, but this is the reverse situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A month after a major spillage, the Welsh Office decided, on the day of the debate on the first prohibition order on the sea fishery, to introduce a precautionary prohibition to coincide with the start of the season. That smacks of double standards and the Minister should explain things more clearly and give a guarantee that if, after another week of sampling when we hope that more fish will be caught, there is no sign of hydrocarbon tainting in any of the fish, the order will be lifted immediately. My constituency, that of my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen and of my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) are suffering a great deal. Our fishing industry is not operating. The shell fishing has finished and parts of the fishery are likely to have serious problems for months or, to judge from the experience of fisheries affected by the Braer disaster, for years. The sooner we get help to release some of the potential for tourist-based activity holidays such as angling—it is a growing activity holiday in my constituency—the better. I urge the Minister to lift this order at the earliest possible opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.7 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I understand the need for the order and therefore support it, it must be kept under constant review and lifted as soon as science allows. As my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) said, river fishing is very important in my constituency and throughout west Wales. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the 
	<i>Salmon Trout and Sea-Trout</i> magazine, which last autumn carried an article describing the River Tywi as the best sea trout river in Britain and one of the best salmon rivers. It is a major leisure facility for people locally and attracts hundreds of visitors every year. Last week, the 
	<i>Carmarthen Journal</i> reported that fishing on the Tywi is estimated to be worth £5 million a year to the local economy. In the 
	<i>Western Telegraph,</i> the secretary of the Carmarthenshire fishermen's federation estimated that fishing in west Wales is worth £10 million to the area. It is an important source of income and of relaxation and entertainment to local people and to visitors. Obviously, we expect compensation from the oil pollution fund for the losses incurred, but there is also a danger of long-term damage to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned earlier about the amount of testing and the vague result of those tests. The Minister said that there was no maximum permitted level of hydrocarbon—it was all fairly arbitrary and more to do with the tainting of fish, which depends more on taste than on any quantitative measure. I ask the Welsh Office and the Environment Agency to monitor the situation regularly and accurately whenever they can catch fish in the area—there must be hundreds out
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
there to test. Surely there must be quantitative measurements and maximum permitted concentrations of hydrocarbons in fish. Once those levels are below the maximum permitted, the order should be lifted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.10 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us what is known about the routes that salmon take as they come in from the Atlantic or the Irish Sea—presumably they come both ways around Ireland? How do they get into the Bristol channel and the Severn estuary? Rivers to the east of the designated area will be affected. As my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke said, if they are cutting the corners around Pembrokeshire, and I accept the evidence given by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. Hargreaves) about the feeding habits of salmon, a large number of the fish that come into the extremely important river fisheries of the Usk and the Wye as well as into the newly cleansed rivers like the Taf will be affected? It is surely impossible to put an order in one area in this way and keep it there for a length of time, and not at the same time test the fish that are caught in important fishing rivers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.12 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hargreaves</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I fully understand my hon. Friend's need for caution, given the possible problem of migratory fish waiting to go into the river systems, like Opposition Members I hope that the order can be lifted as soon as possible. As one who has fished the Tywi and other rivers in Wales, I know the great pleasure that so many people, particularly from the Midlands and Lancashire, have in travelling to Wales and being able to fish these great river systems. I am sure that I speak for thousands of anglers who will be extremely anxious to see the order revoked just as soon as it is reasonably safe to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Donald Thompson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Calder Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious matter. I have listened with interest to contributions from both sides of the Committee. It is peculiar that the alternative to oil—nuclear fuels—caused us to test lambs for years in Cumberland and the north. They proved not to be affected, but I have sat in meetings of irate farmers on several occasions where they made similar points about testing and getting it over with. The firm principle of the polluter pays will at least cover some of the costs of this ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West says that he is neither a fisherman nor a scientist, but he is a considerable politician. Were sewin to be on the menu of the Cardiff Anglers Arms and there were an outbreak of food poisoning that was traced to the salmon, not only would the Minister and the salmon be in hot water but the reputation of the fish would be damaged almost irrevocably. It would take a long time to recover. While sewin is not on the menu, I ask the Minister not to be a la carte in his safety measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate began with an extraordinary question from the hon. Member for Cardiff, West who wanted to know the legal basis for the order. He said that the Government could not take a precautionary view. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the order, which states that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"being of the opinion that there exist or may exist circumstances which are likely to create a hazard to human health through human consumption of food and that in consequence food which is derived or may be in the future derived from migratory fish in the areas described … hereby makes the following Order".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for asserting that my question was extraordinary, but it was based on what he said on the Floor of the House in a debate on 20 March. When it was put to him that the exclusion order for seafish and shellfish should be extended around Cardigan bay on an experimental basis, he replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has been put to me that the designated area should have been extended for a short period so that a testing regime could have cleared the area not affected by the spillage. That would not have ben legally possible."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 March 1996; Vol. 274, c. 439.]</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister today adducing a different legal principle, by which—regardless of whether scientific evidence is available—a decision can be taken on some other basis? The Minister seemed to think on 20 March that was not legally possible. He might call that an extraordinary question, but it is based on exactly what he said about the parallel order on 20 March. It is not extraordinary, unless he thinks that his words then were extraordinary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to a parallel order. I draw the Committee's attention to the distinction between the two orders. We needed scientific evidence for the sea fisheries order, to designate the area concerned. I should tell the hon. Member for Pembroke that we were extremely grateful to the fishermen then for giving us time to collect the necessary samples on which to base a scientific conclusion, by subjecting themselves to a voluntary ban. For the present order, we already knew the area was concerned, so the same problems did not arise. All that we had to do was decide which rivers to designate. They were already running into the area designated by the sea fisheries order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Llanelli asked about the designated officers. The National Rivers Authority—or the Environment Agency, which now has the responsibility—designated 17 water bailiffs to enforce the order. The latest information from them is that they are experiencing no difficulties in enforcing it. The Department does not deal with those who are collecting samples—the Environment Agency deals with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Pembroke and for Carmarthen raised the issue of compensation. The Government are as concerned as the Opposition that anyone who suffers loss should be compensated fairly and properly. Clearly, a regime for making claims has
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
already been set up. Hardship claims can be submitted now, just as they can by sea fishermen. Full claims, as for sea fishermen, will be submitted a little later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chain of causation stretches quite far. It affects not just fishermen's clubs but fishing tackle shops. I know of a shop in Carmarthen whose proprietor is already most concerned about the next few weeks' trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but hardship claims can be made only retrospectively. They cannot be forecast, but must form a part of the full claim made at a subsequent date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pembroke made a point about bass or some other species being inside the prohibited area—I am talking about sea fishes—and then swimming out of the designated area, beyond the order boundary, before being caught. The hon. Gentleman rehearsed questions that he asked me on previous occasions. He knows full well that sampling takes place outside the designated area as well as inside it. I know that the hon. Gentleman's party has been in opposition for many years, but he must understand that the Secretary of State has a duty to protect the public against any possible hazard from consuming polluted fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally accept the duty that was given to the Secretary of State by the order, which is why I was so critical of the fact that he did not exercise the precautionary powers in an area designated offshore from my constituency and from the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for Carmarthen and for Gower (Mr. Wardell), and of my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps drawing a parallel with the Braer incident in Scotland. He said that the Scottish Office had acted more quickly than my Department. We had the advantage of a voluntary ban, and the hon. Gentleman knows full well that the area designated following the Braer incident had to be varied after 19 days because of subsequent sampling. We have not had to vary our order and, given the evidence that is currently available, we do not anticipate that we shall have to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard quite a bit about sampling. To let hon. Members know how small the sample was and to give them some details about habits of migratory fish, I can tell the Committee that one salmon and one sewin have been tested, and four salmon are currently in the freezer. The sewin is important, because sewin feed in coastal waters and—as my hon. Friend for Hall Green said—at this time of the year salmon do not. Nevertheless, oil can enter through the gills. Because we knew that those creatures would traverse polluted waters, the Secretary of State clearly had a duty under the Act to impose the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should also bear in mind the fact that when we discuss evidence of pollution we are also talking about water sampling and pollution to various plants and plankton, as well as the modelling of sea
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
movements and events affecting the likely distribution of the oil and the extent of pollution in that area of the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West questioned the catch-and-release option. As my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley (Sir D. Thompson), who has immense experience, having been a Minister responsible for fisheries in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, graphically illustrated, the likelihood of a polluted fish ending up on a plate somewhere in west Cardiff could have been of political advantage to the hon. Member for Cardiff, West, but would certainly have resulted in the Government, the Secretary of State and me receiving what would have been a justified roasting by Opposition Members. Fortunately, the measures that we are taking will ensure that we shall not get a roasting on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will respond to the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) about the fact that if it is true that, on a precautionary basis, salmon and sewin that pass through oil-polluted waters at the entrance to the Bristol Channel to get up the Cleddau, the Carmathenshire Taf or the Tywi will have to be tested, the same must be true for those going further east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an equal need for precautionary measures to deal with salmon coming round St. David's head from the Irish sea or entering the 50-mile wide gap between the north Devon coast and the south Pembrokeshire coast and gradually being funnelled up. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hall Green will confirm that salmon migrate back across the Atlantic for two reasons—the homing instinct and the herd instinct—and that they will not come across in a group that is all western Cleddau, eastern Cleddau or Taf salmon. They come mixed, and sometimes separate. Therefore salmon that will eventually reach the rivers east of the exclusion zone will surely also need to be sampled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman, who raised the same point as the hon. Member for Pontypridd, is that scientific advice is that if, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, West put it, fish swam and clipped a polluted part of the sea on their way to, say, the Usk or Wye rivers, the fact that they would subsequently have to swim through unpolluted water means that they would quickly become clean again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hall Green made the point that the sewin feed, so even if they passed through another 50 miles of clean water, if they absorbed hydrocarbons they would still be internally polluted in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than consider only the waters of the Wye and the other game rivers of east Wales, it would be more realistic to consider also the Tywi, which is also a good game river, as the Minister knows, and is far closer to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
St. David's head than the entrance of the Wye or Usk is to the southern extremity of the prohibition order at Port-Eynon point. This is a real issue. Is the Environment Agency carrying our tests on migratory fish in rivers that feed into the prohibition order area and the sea alone, or is it looking also at the Tywi, Ystwyth, Rheidol and others? That is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I spoke about fish cleansing themselves, I meant that they metabolise hydrocarbons efficiently. On the hon. Gentleman's second point, we are looking at other rivers in north Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not dealt with my other point about other species such as eels, which are also migratory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we are concerned only with the species specified in the order—migratory fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We realise that the order relates only to salmon and sea trout, but should not it also cover eels and perhaps other migratory species? Is it necessary to cover salmon and sea trout, why not cover other edible migratory fish such as eels, and shads—although I am not sure that there are any of the latter in the rivers that were mentioned—for which the same considerations will apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clearly does not appreciate that the Government do not decide to which fish the order will apply. We have to take the advice of the scientists who advise us, that those are the fish that should be specified in the order. If the hon. Gentleman knew anything about fishing, he would appreciate that eels are not an important source in the area so they are not specified in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that as we have discovered this week through the organs of the press that the shadow Secretary of State for Wales is closely related to the royal family, the reason Opposition Members are so concerned is that they are aware that at least one former English monarch died from a surfeit of lamprey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point in what I hope is the final stage of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am gratified by the patience and forbearance of all those affected by the sea and freshwater prohibition orders. I assure them that we shall do all that we can to ensure that the effects of the incident are minimised so that we and they can return to normal business and pleasure as quickly and painlessly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
