	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause, which I am moving on behalf of the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group, would reduce the minimum period which has to be served before an offender can first be considered for parole from 12 months to six months. Its effect would be, firstly, to bring some short-term prisoners, who are currently ineligible for parole, into the parole scheme; and, secondly, to enable prisoners serving sentences of more than 18 months and less than three years to be considered for parole at an earlier stage in their sentences than they are at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since its introduction in 1968, the parole scheme has shown that many sentences can be reduced in length without significant risk to the public. The scheme itself has demonstrated that a large number of offenders can quite safely be released on licence, on parole, into the community without in any way endangering the public significantly. In 1980, for example, 10,070 determinate sentence prisoners were considered for parole, of whom 5,077–50·4 per cent.—were granted parole, and the proportion of eligible prisoners who are granted parole at some point in their sentences is now 60 per cent., yet the proportion of those recalled for misbehaviour while on parole has always been relatively low. During 1980, 445 people on parole from determinate sentences were recalled to prison during their parole period and had their licences revoked. This represents 8·7 per cent, of those recommended for parole in that year. Fewer than half of these—183 out of the 445—had committed another offence while on parole; the others were recalled for breaches of their parole licence which did not involve the commission by them of an offence
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even this very low rate of re-offending while on parole licence must be seen in the light of the Parole Board's comments in its report for 1971:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In all fixed term sentences the question before the Board is not whether a man should be released from prison—this is going to happen in any event—but when
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
is the best moment for release, and whether the risk of his re-offending is more likely to be reduced if he is placed under supervision and given statutory after-care, than if he is released at the normal time without any control over his future behaviour."</p></blockquote>
The Board expanded on this point in its report for 1977:
	<br><blockquote><p>'Parole was introduced because it was believed that the early release on licence of selected prisoners, under the supervision of the probation service, would be of more value both to society and the individual offender than continued imprisonment. We continue to believe this to be the case. Without parole, and the support and supervision which it gives to a prisoner re-entering the community, some prisoners might drift back into circumstances which would eventually return them to a life of crime. The sanction to recall to prison reminds the prisoner that he is continuing to serve his sentence, albeit in more congenial conditions in the community, and helps to deter him from disobeying the conditions of his licence."</p></blockquote>
There is now considerable research evidence available which was summarised in the Home Office's " Review of Parole in England and Wales" published in 1981, that the combined effect of parole supervision and the threat of recall appears to reduce significantly the probability of an offender's being reconvicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, short-term prisoners—those who constitute the least danger to society—are not eligible for release on parole. This is because fixed sentence prisoners first become eligible for parole after serving a third of their sentence or 12 months, whichever is the longer. A prisoner who gains his full remission will be released after serving two-thirds of his sentence in any event; and this means in practice that parole does not apply to prisoners serving sentences of 18 months or less. This can result in great injustice, as Lord Justice Waller pointed out in an address to NACRO's Annual General Meeting held on 30th October 1980, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The injustice is best illustrated by this example. Two men are convicted of a serious crime. They are of previous good character. One is the ringleader who gets three years, the other taking a relatively minor part gets 18 months. The ringleader gets parole and they are both released on the same day. It must appear unjust to the minor party. There is no parole available for him though, of course, if there were he would be extremely eligible."</p></blockquote>
Lowering the minimum period which must be served before release on parole, as the new clause proposes, would help to reduce, if not eliminate, the injustices referred to by, amongst others, Lord Justice Waller. It would not, of course, eliminate them completely because, wherever the line is drawn, there will be anomalies on either side of it; and it is for that reason that the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group would prefer a scheme of automatic supervised release, which could be applied to prisoners serving sentences of any length, however short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we shall return to that subject and debate it on another new clause, that course of action has now been ruled out by the Home Secretary and by the Minister in our previous proceedings in this Committee. Nevertheless, the lower the threshhold for parole eligibility, the less glaring will be the anomalies and the less serious will be the injustices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
I cannot envisage the Minister being able to produce any serious objections of principle to the new clause. I cannot see any major difficulties of practice. I know there are some slight administrative problems which the Minister may have to resort to in his argument, but I am fully aware that those can be completely and clearly overcome if there is a political will to introduce this scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-party Penal Affairs Group concluded in its report " Too Many Prisoners " that this proposal was not only right in principle, but also perfectly practicable in effect. I therefore look forward to hearing the Minister announcing to the Committee that he shares our views and that he will find it possible to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case for mitigating the anomalies that any system of parole is liable to throw up by virtue of having to draw a line at some point, as the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) has just reminded us, is a strong one. The anomaly which is presented by our present arrangements has been illustrated strikingly by Lord Justice Waller, who speaks with the authority of a former member of the Parole Board and also as somebody in the Court of Appeal to whose views we always pay the closest attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are in sympathy with the objective of new clause 14, but I have to say that there are substantial difficulties that we do not as yet see our way round. The effect of the new clause will be to reduce from 12 months to six the minimum period which a prisoner must serve after the date of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole. That would increase the number of prisoners qualifying for consideration for parole each year from the present 10,000 to about 19,000. The requirement for a prisoner to serve at least one-third of his sentence before qualifying would be unaffected. It has been estimated on the basis of fairly arbitrary assumptions about selection rates that the clause might increase the population of parolees under supervision by the probation service from more than 3,000 as at present to more than 5,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not opposed to the idea of extending the benefits of parole to shorter sentence prisoners by reducing the minimum qualifying period, but it is of great importance that parole is essentially a selection process, not an across-the-board release or amnesty. If well-informed judgments about a prisoner's suitability for release on licence are to be made, a minimum period of time is required after sentencing and reception into prison for him to be observed and reported on. Otherwise one is into the country of re-sentencing, and that is not a change that we can possibly support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These difficulties are not new. They are intrinsic to the nature of parole, and they were considered most recently in the Review of Parole to which the hon. Gentleman referred, published in May last year, when it was concluded that there seemed to be no way of applying parole in its present form
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
to those serving shorter sentences. Since this clause was put down, we have looked again at the question in as much detail as possible in the time available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not able to accept the clause as it stands, but because there is such a persuasive body of opinion in favour of some reduction in the minimum qualifying period for parole—the present chairman of the Parole Board is among those who support a change—and because it would be wrong to regard the question as having necessarily been decided for all time, my right hon. Friend has decided to undertake a further detailed study to see whether some way cannot be found, without endangering the principle of selectivity and without making unacceptable demands upon available resources, of achieving the end that is desired. I think it is important that parole's success should not be put at risk by significantly reducing the characteristic of selectivity that is central to the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say who will be undertaking this review, when it will commence, when it is expected to be completed, and whether or not the findings will then be published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not as yet, but if the hon. Gentleman is a little patient, I think he may find some encouragement. We cannot, of course, say what the outcome of this review will be and, because this will probably be the last opportunity in the present Parliament of amending the 1967 Act, the Government have decided to seek a power to reduce the minimum qualifying period for parole by statutory instrument, which would of course be subject to parliamentary approval. We propose to seek that power by bringing forward a new clause on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear that I am not entering into any commitment to exercise the proposed power. I am saying that we shall keep the question under review and, if on the further consideration to which I have referred, we decided that some reduction in the minimum qualifying period was both justified and practicable, the existence of the new power would enable us to work it, provided Parliament approved, without having to wait for another opportunity for primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that assurance that the possibility of a reduction will be kept under review, with means taken to secure it if so advised, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Dr. Sum-merskill) will be delighted to hear of the review of short sentences from a parole point of view which the Minister of State has just announced. Certainly all others of us on the Opposition side of the Committee are likely to take the same view, particularly on the promise that at a later stage of the Bill there will be introduced enabling powers to put into operation whatever may be ultimately decided. Subject to what my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) might say, one might almost say that, having said that, there is very little more to be said, but I think there is perhaps just a little more.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first place, I hope the Minister will agree, and I hope that whoever conducts this review will take the view, that where one is dealing with relatively short sentences, the need for the very careful and punctilious type of review that one has in the case of the long-sentence offender who committed a very serious offence or who has served a number of sentences in custody, is not so great. One can be more relaxed, in other words, about granting parole in the case of the shorter-sentence offender than in the ordinary way in the case of the longer-sentence offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that, the shorter-sentence offender ought to be able to be trusted on parole with very much less supervision than perhaps one finds necessary in the case of the longer-sentence offender, quite apart from the length of supervision which will in any event be of a shorter duration. One would expect in the ordinary way that the degree of supervision and therefore the amount of time of the services to carry it out would normally be a good deal less than in the case of the longer-term offender. I should wish to see the Government, as a result of this review—whatever Government it may be when the time comes—taking a courageous step in the case of the short-term offender and being willing to take considerably more risk than the public will accept—or at least it is suposed that the public will accept—in the case of the longer-term offender who comes up for review of parole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major factor that we always have in mind in virtually all our debates is to reduce the prison population by keeping out of population those who need not be there and, in this case, taking out of prison those who do not need to remain there. Whatever risks there may be in relation to the short-sentence offender involved in what the Minister has described to us, it seems to me that the risks that arise from overcrowded prisons and, indeed, the evil consequences for the longer and the shorter-term offender alike that arise from confinement in the kind of conditions that we have today easily outweigh the dangers and risks involved in taking a courageous stand on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's announcement. Though it does not go as far as perhaps we would have liked on this new clause, at least it shows that in principle the Government are willing to accept the philosophy behind it and that it is simply a matter in due course of devising the necessary means to achieve the ends which the enabling clause will allow to be achieved by statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, yet again, for what the Minister has said. He has intimated clearly that the Government accept both the philosophy and the intent behind new clause 14, and I am grateful to him for announcing the review of parole, and also for the indication he has given—he does not seem to want to call it a commitment, but it seems, to be a commitment nevertheless—that the Government will take enabling legislation. It is to be hoped that a future Labour Government will implement that legislation at an early date. In the light of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
assurances, there is not much more that I could have asked for on this occasion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Mr. Kilroy-Silk.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<i>Brought up, and read the First Time.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provides that no court shall pass a first custodial sentence on an offender without first considering a social inquiry report. Like many other of the new clauses, it embodies a recommendation made by the parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group in our report, " Too Many Prisoners ". The purpose of a social inquiry report was first laid down in the Criminal Justice Act 1967, which stated that in accordance with the direction of a court, a probation officer preparing such a report could inquire
	<br><blockquote><p>"into the circumstances or home surroundings of any person with a view to assisting the court in determining the most suitable method of dealing with his case."</p></blockquote>
Social inquiry reports include information about the social and domestic background of the offender which is relevant to the court's assessment of how responsible or culpable he was for the offence. They contain information about the offender and his surroundings, which is relevant to the court's consideration of how his criminal career—if one can so describe it—might be checked or thwarted. Several Home Office circulars over the years have stated that the reports should normally be based upon inquiries into the character, personality, and social and domestic background of the accused; his record at any educational, training or residential establishments; his employment prospects; and, where appropriate, his attitudes and habits as known to his most recent employer. Probation officers may also express opinions on an offender's likely response to probation and to other forms of sentences, and, if they consider it appropriate, may make specific recommendations for or against a particular course Of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although section 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 empowered the Home Secretary to make rules requiring courts to consider a social inquiry report before imposing a prison sentence on an offender who had not served a previous custodial sentence, no such rules have ever actually been made, and the Home Office has instead chosen to recommend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
this practice to the courts rather than incorporate it in statutory rules. The Home Office has recommended courts, as normal practice, to consider a social inquiry report before imposing a borstal or detention centre sentence, and before imposing a prison sentence on an offender who has not previously received a prison or borstal sentence. However, information collected on a sample of offenders sentenced in 1971 showed that magistrates in fact neglected to obtain a social inquiry report on the majority of men receiving their first prison sentence, which suggests that, at the very least, the Home Secretary's advice on this point has gone unheeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the importance that everybody—probation officers, social workers, magistrates, justices' clerks, and indeed the Home Secretary himself—attaches to the importance of a first custodial sentence, and therefore to the need for the courts to have all the relevant information of the kind that is perhaps best presented in a social inquiry report before making such a custodial disposal, it is highly important that the evidence produced seems to suggest that courts are not in fact applying the recommendation made to them by successive, various Home Secretaries in numerous circulars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the position has probably improved since the research was presented in 1971. However, the new clause would make quite sure that the practice of considering a social inquiry report is followed in practice before any custodial sentence is imposed on an offender who has not previously served one. If the recommendation or injunction is to be so important to courts, and if it appears that there is no real substantial reason of resources or administrative difficulty why a social inquiry report of this nature should not always be presented to the court before the imposition of a first custodial sentence, there seems to be no substantial reason why we cannot write this rule for the first time into legislation, and make it a statutory obligation upon the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for ensuring that this is done was succinctly expressed by the Justices' Clerks' Society in its evidence to the May inquiry:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first custodial sentence (of whatever type) can be a crucial point in an offender's life, demanding the closest scrutiny by every possible agency."</p></blockquote>
The implications of a first custodial sentence are potentially so serious, as has been acknowledged by all the commentators on the Bill, that the court should always have all the relevant information available to it before making such a grave and important decision. Moreover, a probation officer's assessment of an offender is particularly relevant in determining whether he or she might be a suitable candidate for the imposition of a probation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have stated repeatedly that they wish to reverse the current decline in the number of probation orders being imposed, and to see the probation order used as a full and effective alternative to custody. If that is what they really believe, the consideration of social inquiry reports in all cases where the offender is at risk of receiving a custodial sentence, particularly for the first time, would
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
be an important means of ensuring that the suitability or otherwise of an offender for a probation order disposal was brought on every single occasion forcibly to the attention of the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just that we want to ensure that all the relevant characteristics of an offender are before the court before it determines on a custodial disposal, but also that we see the social inquiry report as one way of reversing the trend towards the decline in the use of probation orders, a trend which the Government, too, assert that they wish to reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value, in another context, of social inquiry reports as an aid to sentencing was demonstrated by Home Office Research Study No. 48, " Social Inquiry Reports: A Survey", published in 1979. This described the results of a sentencing exercise carried out with a sample of magistrates, which was designed specifically to assess the types of information which magistrates most frequently used when determining what kind of sentence to impose. The researchers identified 21 different types of information which the sample of magistrates most commonly used when making up their minds as to the sentence. They naturally took into account such matters as the offence, the offender's previous convictions, his attitude to his present offence, his family relationships; but also other things such as, ranked in order of importance, his employment, his parents or his partner, his personality, his response to previous sentences, his friends, his medical history, and so on. Some of that information would be available to the court in any event—the kind of information, for example, that one would expect to find in the police antecedence. Many of them, however, are social factors, about which by far the most satisfactory way of obtaining objective information would be by means of a social inquiry report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the acceptance by the Minister of the amendment would mean an imposition of an extra work load on the probation service. It is therefore perhaps not unreasonable to ascertain the views of the probation service. Fortunately, we had those views brought to our attention by a memorandum addressed to all members of the Criminal Justice Bill Standing Committee by NAPO, the National Association of Probation Officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the views of the association are worth reporting at some length. It strongly supports the proposed new clause 15, since the imposition of a first custodial sentence is a very serious step. It believes that before deciding to impose such a sentence, the court should always have obtained full information about the offender and his situation, in order to decide whether a custodial sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances. Social inquiry reports are the courts' major tool in obtaining information, and, as the association representing probation officers who write the vast majority of social inquiry reports, it welcomes this proposal and feels that it is important and appropriate for the probation service and for social services departments always to be requested to provide a social inquiry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
report, and to become involved with an offender at this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit to the Committee that the new clause would provide a valuable safeguard for those individuals facing the prospect of the imposition of a first custodial sentence. It would at the same time enable the courts to sentence offenders more appropriately by ensuring that every single court would be fully informed of all the factors which might be relevant to the important decision about whether an individual should be deprived of his liberty for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with the previous new clause, which the Minister in effect accepted, I can see no reason either in principle or in practice why this should not be accepted by the Government and why it should not normally become part and parcel of the everyday practice of our courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We should, as always, take very seriously recommendations from the probation officers themselves, who are concerned with social inquiry reports. They and the social workers are the people who have to draw these up and do the work entailed, and they have strongly supported the new clause. They recognise that the first custodial sentence of any offender is an extremely important step for a court to take, and an extremely important influence on that offender's life, and therefore, that it should not be imposed unless the courts have all the information possible about the circumstances of that offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The probation service and the social services departments therefore not only should be asked to draw up the report in order that the court can decide whether to impose custodial sentence, but it is important that those two departments should be involved with the offender at the very beginning, before he actually goes into a custodial institution. They should be concerned with his background at a very early stage, rather than only on, say, his second offence or on his release from custody. It is far better that a custodial sentence should be avoided, or found to be unnecessary, if all this information was obtained before the sentence was imposed, rather than after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, but particularly because it is so strongly supported by the probation officers, I hope that the Minister will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also support the new clause. I know that the clause itself might conceivably be criticised because it does not cover the case of a person who refuses to provide the information for a probation report, and therefore the clause might have to be altered to cover that situation. I know, too, that it can be argued that where there is a mandatory sentence such as life imprisonment, whether there is a probation report or not, the court is obliged to pass a life sentence
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
One might argue, given that sort of offence and given offences of terrorism or rape, since a sentence of imprisonment would normally be imposed, why bother with an obligatory probation report? The fact is, however, that for that type of sentencing, a more accurate idea of the appropriate sentence to be passed can be achieved if one has the assistance of such a report. Even in the case of a mandatory life sentence, as the years go by a parole board might find it of value to consider a probation report made at the time in respect of the person pleading guilty to, or found guilty of, murder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally, then, I would consider it advantageous to have in the law a requirement of the kind set out in the new clause, and, if there are ways in which the clause ought to be improved, I am sure that the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) would be prepared, on an undertaking from the Minister to produce improved working, to withdraw the clause. Certainly its substance seems to me very valuable. I hope that the Minister will lend a sympathetic ear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silltin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I, too, support the proposed new clause, and have two points to make. The first relates to the very welcome concession or announcement which the Minister made when we were debating the previous new clause. The Minister explained the difficulties of selectivity and selection in relation to those who might be eligible for parole if we fixed an earlier date than the present one for the review of parole. Where one is dealing with an offender who is serving his first custodial sentence, the likelihood of parole being granted to him, if an earlier date is eventually accepted, is that much greater than where one is dealing with somebody who has been repeatedly in custody. Here is an opportunity of ensuring that at any rate a good deal of the necessary work is done to assess his home circumstances, the various factors which influenced him, and his chances of employment and a stable home when released. Here is the opportunity for those factors to be assessed, not during the relatively short period after the beginning of the sentence but in advance of it, and it will surely be a considerable help when the extension of the parole system which the Minister has conditionally adumbrated—if I may so put it—comes into operation. That is a factor by no means to be neglected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more general point of the purpose of the clause, my only reservation about it is that it does not necessarily go far enough. During the five years when I had the privilege of acting as a recorder, and therefore having to make decisions about whether to send people into custody, my view was—and I always acted upon it—that I should always have a social inquiry report before sending anyone to custody irrespective of whether it was the first custodial sentence or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many occasions when the courts, including the Court of Appeal, will decide that somebody who has a long record of custodial sentences has reached a point in his criminal career when there are circumstances of his background and relationships which he may have made where it would be advantageous to him and society to decide that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
the normal penalty of custody was inappropriate and that he should go free, subject to probation. Thank goodness our judges take such an enlightened view from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are not considering cases of that kind. We are considering the first custodial sentence, and there it is even more important than on other occasions that the court should always have the advantage of a full knowledge of the background of the offender, the influences that have been brought to bear upon him, the stability of his home circumstances, the employment opportunities that are open to him, and all the other factors which influence a decision on whether his life should be disrupted by the inevitable effects of going into custody, or whether it is better that he should remain in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some Conservative Members will no doubt think that in saying that I am merely displaying a typical softness, but in practice that is not the effectiveness by any means. I have found that the honest and objective reports of the probation officers which one receives—and perhaps one of the most important aspects of this is the fact that a judge sitting in a particular court regularly comes to know the value of the reports of particular probation officers extremely well—by no means always are in favour of the more lenient course. Certainly on occasions when I have thought of a more lenient course than sending someone into custody, I have been faced with the view in a probation officer's report—based upon his background and reaction to the circumstances of that background of the defendant—which suggested that in his case the right course to adopt would be the short, sharp shock of going into custody. That his been a factor which I have found very important to take into consideration in my ultimate decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not please think that a clause of this kind is a licence to softness for those who commit offences. It is a licence for the courts to know everything they should know before making one of the most important decisions which will affect a person's life, that which decides whether he should have his first experience of a custodial penalty or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the philosophy behind the clause is one with which the Minister will sympathise. I hope that he will be able at least to go some way in the direction of accepting that it should form part of our statute law rather than that it should be left to the discretion of the courts, guided however much they may be by the wise words of our judiciary or Home Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some weeks ago, this Committee considered an amendment which would have ensured legal representation for young offenders appearing before the courts. We did not pass that amendment. Had we done so, I suggest this new clause might have been less necessary, because any solicitor defending a young offender would have gone to the trouble of obtaining this sort of information in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
We have a situation in this country where a large number of young offenders before the courts, some of whom on charges which may lead to custodial sentences, do not have legal representation. In such cases, this clause becomes even more important, because it is the one way in which something can be said on behalf of the defendant, not naturally speaking to his guilt or innocence, but to other factors in his background which ought properly to influence the court in the type of sentence it thought appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that, given the rather alarming figures on the lack of legal representation, the Minister would view this new clause more favourably than he might otherwise have done. I hope and trust that the effect of the new clause would be not merely to oblige the courts to ensure that defendants who were accused of an offence which would lead to a custodial sentence would have this type of report before them. It would make the courts generally more likely to ask for social inquiry reports. But, as some of my hon. Friends have said, the main emphasis must be in instances where custodial sentence is likely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The substance of what we have debated on the new clause to some extent—but not wholly—overlaps the debate we had on 11 February on a not dissimilar amendment. In the course of that debate, I said that the Government recognised the desirability of information about the offence and the offender being obtained by a court before sentence was passed on a young offender. I said at that time that—we took two amendments together— we saw rather more attraction in the amendment moved by the right hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin), which was to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"circumstances as to the offence and as to the offender"</p></blockquote>
than in the first amendment moved by the hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk), which had the effect of requiring a court to take account of a social inquiry report. What I said on that occasion was also to the effect that it was the overwhelming practice of the courts to have regard to social inquiry reports, but that it was not the invariable practice and that there were certain circumstances where one saw that it would be unnecessary to require them so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the Government would give further thought to the proposal that the court should in certain circumstances be obliged to obtain and consider a social inquiry report on an offender before imposing a custodial sentence on him. What was proposed then was that the obligation should apply to all custodial sentences on young offenders under the age of 21. This new clause would require the consideration of a social inquiry report before the imposition of a first custodial sentence on an offender of any age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertook that the Government would consider the questions raised in both these amendments together. We have done so with great care. I know that the new clause reflects very serious concern about the way in which custodial sentences are used, and that it has the authoritative backing of the all-party penal Affairs Group. The Government are of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
the view that the consideration of social inquiry reports in the great majority of cases is both desirable and necessary. It is against that background that we have looked at the whole question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task which we set the courts to carry out on our behalf is to do justice to each individual offender in the differing circumstances of each particular case. The ultimate and difficult discretion always remains with the court. We have had interesting discussions in this Committee about how far Parliament can or should legislate effectively to give courts guidance in the exercise of their sentencing powers. This clause raises rather the same kind of question, but it bears on the slightly less crucial issue of whether Parliament should seek to direct the manner in which the courts are to fulfil their duty to make sure they have the information they need to come to a proper decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to be clear about what the real issue is here. It is not the desirability of obtaining relevant information. It is about whether a court should be obliged always and invariably to obtain a certain kind of information in a certain kind of form, regardless of whether that information is relevant or useful or whether it is already available in some other form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to criticise the drafting of the new clause, because that is not crucial to this issue. I think I can simply illustrate one point from the text.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In is present form, the clause would oblige a court to obtain a social inquiry report on a convicted murderer for whom the only possible sentence was the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. That would be so patently ridiculous that one might find a way round that, perhaps. But it is not the only exception. The courts deal with a great many cases—including cases of first offenders—where on the most enlightened, humanitarian or even merciful view there is plainly no possible alternative to a custodial sentence. Again, one can say that a social inquiry report would help the court to decide on the appropriate length of sentence. But it is the courts which have to make these decisions, and the Government are of the view that they can be relied on to obtain the information they need to reach sensible, informed conclusions by one or more of a variety of sources and means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause would make a social inquiry report obligatory in the case of a first custodial sentence. Offenders in this category already have a considerable degree of statutory protection. Clause 1 of the Bill provides that no custodial sentences may be imposed on an offender aged under 21 unless the court is of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate. The court must obtain and consider information about the circumstances, and take into account any information relevant to the offender's character and physical and mental condition. In section 20 of the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973, there are almost identical restrictions on the imprisonment of adults who have not previously served prison sentences. In addition, section 21 of the 1973 Act ensures that no offender to whom this new clause would apply could be
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
given a custodial sentence unless he was legally represented or had an opportunity to apply for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The probation service and the courts have also been given very detailed guidance on the desirability of obtaining social inquiry reports, and there is an extensive section in the handbook " The Sentence of the Courts " on the importance of these reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the Home Secretary of the day had real grounds for concern about the use of social inquiry reports, he could exercise his power to make rules under section 45 of the 1973 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So this category of offender who has not been to prison before is already the subject, or beneficiary, of very considerable statutory safeguards and protection. In these circumstances, we have had to ask ourselves whether it is right to go yet further and to say to the courts " You shall not only satisfy yourselves that you have all the information relevant to the offence and to the offender, but you shall obtain that by this particular means, namely, the social inquiry report".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have concluded after some consultation that it would not be justifiable to impose so rigid and invariable requirements on the courts on the lines of this new clause. We have no reason to suppose that reports are not obtained where they should be. That means that in all the other cases on which this clause would bite its only possible effect would be to give rise to considerable and pointless delay—delay which might well be spent, in the majority of cases, in custody. I do not believe that we should add to the number of persons remanded in custody without very good cause and necessity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman said he had come to these conclusions after some consultation. Who has he consulted about this, because the probation officers and social workers are in favour of the new clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have indicated that I have paid considerable regard to the opinions of the National Association of Probation Officers—I think I have done so at any rate and if I have not I do so now— and also to the all-party Penal Affairs Group. We have consulted among the judiciary and the magis tracy—and it is certainly not inconsistent with the view I expressed when we debated these matters on 11 February—and we have come to the opinion that there would be an unjustifiable probability of adding to remands in custody and adding to delay in circum stances where that would not only be unnecessary but harmful. We will, of course, continue to keep this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, if the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying now—as he said on a previous occasion in relation to medical reports and he was wrong then—that the writing of this clause into the Bill will result in a larger number of people being remanded in custody or being remanded for longer periods, and that is correct it is something which we on this side of the Committee would have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
to take as seriously as he now does. If that is the case, why has the Home Secretary—and successive Home Secretaries—issued circulars to the courts enjoining them to take note of what he regards as the good practice of insisting upon having a social inquiry report before imposing a custodial sentence? If it applies in those cases then it applies with equal force in this case. The only change we are suggesting today is that what the Home Secretary has recommended as good practice by means of circular we write into legislation as a statutory obligation. That is all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not right. I have already said that we have no reason to suppose that reports are not obtained where they should be and where it is necessary for them to be obtained. We do not believe it is the case that people are sentenced to custody without a social inquiry report where the circumstances require that a social inquiry report should be obtained and taken into account. If that is right there must be certain cases upon which this clause would bite which would require the obtaining and taking into account of a social inquiry report where that is not necessary. It is in those circumstances that a remand in custody might well take place which would not be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, as I think the Minister is saying, that sort of case is very much the exception rather than the rule—and indeed even in that sort of case there is much to be said for the court having had the report before it even if it is driven to the conclusion that a custodial sentence is inescapable because of the nature of the offence and that kind of thing—surely there cannot be very much in the point which is being made about the number of remands in custody which are likely to arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that it is the exception rather than the rule, but I do not agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman that because only a few people might be remanded in custody where otherwise they would not have been, and it is not necessary, that is something that we should clearly overlook. I do not think that is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister again. He is talking about cases where, because of the circumstances, irrespective of what a social inquiry report might say, the court takes the view that there should be a sentence of immediate imprisonment or other form of detention. In those circumstances what delay is there likely to be in having a social inquiry report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The delay will take place if the court takes the view that a social inquiry report ought to be obtained while the accused is in custody. It is a delay in which somebody is remanded in custody before he knows what the sentence of the court will be, which seems undesirable in principle and in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have indicated that the Government are prepared, wherever they believe that a sound case has
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
been made for acceptance of a new clause, to accede to the clause or to bring forward measures later in the Bill to give effect to it. I assure the Committee that it is only after the fullest consideration of all these issues that I reluctantly have to conclude that I am not able to display the same accommodating attitude to this new clause that I have been glad to do earlier.

	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
This new clause introduces into our discussion a totally new area of considerable interest. I hope that hon. Members opposite will regard it one one to which they can make a valuable contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already have in our law a system by which a court can defer sentence. It is a fairly recent innovation and I am not certain to what extent use is being made if it. That purpose of that power is totally different from that of new clause 17. The purpose is to give the courts an additional power in that, having decided that they will sentence an offender to a term of imprisonment, they would have the power to defer the commencement of that term until a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such power has not been used in this country;the power that the Bill now contains of enabling the courts to pass a sentence which is partly immediate and partly suspended is almost the reverse of it.The purpose of this power is to seek to ensure that some of the more drastic effects of imprisonment, particularly for a person who may be subjected to custody for the first time and for those sentenced to relatively short terms of custody, will be mitigated by a postponement of the inception of the term of imprisonment.The postponement would enable an offender to make provision for his family and his future employment; to tie up the threads that are inevitably broken during a period of imprisonment or other custody which is to take effect immediately. In addition, in cases where there is the possibility of an appeal it would give time for the transcript of the evidence to be obtained so that proper and full consideration of an appeal can be given before the offender starts to serve his term of imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In far too many cases a person serves part of a term of imprisonment and then, as a result of an appeal, his conviction is quashed and it is decided that he ought never to have served that term of imprisonment. The new clause would be of considerable help in avoiding that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many different reasons why a provision of this kind should be introduced into our penal system. Althought it would be an innovation in this country, it is by no means an innovation in the rest of the world. Systems of this kind exist in the United States, but coming nearer to home there is an excellent example of such a system, introduced in 1974 in the Netherlands. That is a system which is much wider than that suggested by the new clause. It is one which contains a call-up provision under which those who have been on bail before trial are not required to start their sentence immediately. They receive a call-up letter which requires them to report on a fixed day to a named prison. They can then apply for deferment of the call-up date, which is granted on reasonable grounds. There are sanctions in the system because punctual reporting in obedience to the call-up is a matter which is taken into account in deciding in what conditions the sentence should be served, for example, whether in secure or open conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary all-party Penal Affairs Group obtained a good deal of evidence about the way in which this system worked in the Netherlands and
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
was satisfied that it worked well. In October 1978 after four years or more, it was considered to be operating satisfactorily, with 40 per cent, reporting on the call-up day while the higher percentage were granted deferment and reported on the date to which their sentence was deferred. A small percentage did not and had to be dealt with by arrest, but in the view of the Netherlands authorities the percentage was too small to justify reconsideration of the system, which they regarded as very sound.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have followed with interest his reflections upon the American and in particular the Dutch system. But is it not the case in Holland that whereas the numbers waiting for custody have remained roughly constant over the last five years, about a third to a quarter of the 10,000 who at any one time are in the queue waiting to be called up disappear and are not traced. In understand also that 10 per cent, of those eventually receive a pardon. If that is correct, it does not seem a very satisfactory feature to lose about a third of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not consistent with the evidence which the all-party Penal Affairs Group obtained, that not more than 20 per cent, at most and generally rather less default. But that does not mean that they disappear. If they do not turn up on the required date they are treated in a more severe way when they go into custody than if they had obeyed the call-up date. The Netherlands authorities do not regard that kind of percentage as a particular worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister has knowledge that the Netherlands authorities take a different view from that given in evidence to the all-party Penal Affairs Group, he will tell the Committee. If he knows of some intention on their part, because of the high rate of defaulting or people disappearing, to abandon this system, that is an important factor that we would want to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group published its report " Too Many Prisoners " some time ago. All these matters were clearly set out in the report and I have heard of no challenge to the picture as I have given it since that date. If there has been such a challenge, no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) will inform the Committee. I fully accept that if the result of a system of this kind were that a substantial proportion of the people involved disappeared without trace, as the Minister suggests, that would be a serious consideration for us to bear in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course my right hon. and learned Friend is right. If the Minister has informa tion to which we were not privy which has changed since the publication of our report in June 1980, we should like to hear it and naturally will take it into account in determining whether a deferment of the custodial sentence is a good idea. My right hon. and learned Friend did not have the information immediately available to him. Neither did I, but I have had time while he has been speaking to look it up.

We were told that of those called up an average of 40 per cent, reported on the call-up day; 40 per cent, to 45 per cent, after being granted a deferment; and 15 to 20 per cent, defaulted and were called up after default and arrested. Those are the kinds of figures to which my right hon. and learned Friend alluded in his speech, and they do not seem unreasonable.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend. I repeat that if the Minister has different figures, no doubt he will give them to the Committee. This matter was discussed between the group and the Secretary of State and, having been present on that occasion, I do not recall that the figures were challenged. The figures may be wrong; I do not know. If the matter turns upon that consideration alone, I shall take the optimistic view that the Minister will respond sympathetically if eventually he is satisfied that the figures that he has given are nowhere near as critical.

In principle, this provision will provide an important value in the penal system for keeping people out of custody who should not be there, and for ensuring that no unnecessary disruption is caused to their lives or to the lives of their families. When reference is made to the effect on the family of a custodial sentence, one often hears people say, " He ought to have thought of that before he did what he did." That is very fine, but unhappily it is very rare that the family has the opportunity to think about it. The disruption which custodial sentences cause to the life of the wife and children of the offender is a penalty that society requires them to bear for the offence of the man in the family. At least we can do our best to make that penalty as little as possible in their case, and this is one of the ways in which other enlightened systems secure that that result flows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the proposal is novel so far as this country is concerned, it is by no means one which has come direct from the Penal Affairs Group. The Advisory Council on the Penal System in its report " Young Adult Offenders" in 1974 made a case for something of this kind. It said
	<br><blockquote><p>"We can … envisage circumstances where a court would consider a custodial sentence unavoidable but in view of some imminent event in the life of the offender, or some aspect of personal or family circumstances, would think it inappropriate or unduly oppressive for him to be committed to custody immediately "</p></blockquote>
It gave examples of this and recommended that
	<br><blockquote><p>"To meet circumstances such as these … when making a custody and control order the court should have power in exceptional circumstances to postpone the execution of the custodial element for a short, specified period …".</p></blockquote>
As long ago as 1974 the idea was put forward; it has not been given effect to since and we propose in this new clause to begin to go—although certainly not all the way that the Netherlands system goes— some part of the way so as to give the court power, if a person is sentenced to immediate imprisonment and has been on bail before sentence, to make an order deferring the operation of the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
One assumes that this would be done for some good reason, such as suggested by the advisory council, and the court would then have that power. This is only a step in the direction that the all-party Penal Affairs Group would have liked to go. It is an experimental step which would enable the Government to judge the value of a provision of this kind before deciding whether to go all the way that systems like that in the Netherlands go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that the Government will not dismiss this idea out of hand but will give it serious consideration. Whilst I am not optimistic that the new clause will be recommended as it stands, none the less I would hope that the Government would not take the view that this is an idea which should simply be thrown out of the window, being an idea that the advisory council has given no weight to at all, and that we shall hear from the Minister that he is at least sympathetic to what we propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dubs</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an imaginative proposal and I hope the Committee will accept it. It seems that there are two essential safeguards contained in it, which would prevent any danger for the public. The first is that it would apply only to people who have been on bail either pending their appearance in court or pending sentence. We are talking about people who are not regarded as a danger to the public and who anyway are living at home pending their court appearance. I should have thought that there was not much greater likelihood of their failing to appear when called up to serve their sentence than that they would fail to appear for their court appearance if they were bailed before their trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is a safeguard that it would all be at the discretion of the court; the court itself could decide whether any individual merited the particular form of treatment suggested in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that, given the pressure that the court itself can decide whether any individual merits the form of treatment suggested in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the pressure that the Prison Department is under and the increase in the prison population, the Prison Department should see this as a source of help. On occasions, the prison to which an accused might be sent, might be full. It would ease the pressure of the Prison Department if it had a little flexibility so that the individual is not brought forward for custodial sentence until there is room in the prison without overcrowding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is that when an individual is sent to prison and given a custodial sentence, the intention is that he should be punished, not his family. Yet at present—in contrast to the system in the Netherlands which is much more enlightened—the speed with which a prisoner finds himself taken from his home and family to serve his sentence is not only a punishment on the prisoner—that is certainly deserved—but a punishment on his family. Giving the individual a short time to make the necessary arrangements for his family for the period when he will be away from them is surely a way of preventing the punishment reflecting as much on the family as upon the person who has committed the offence.

This is a modest proposal, with which the Minister can hardly find much to disagree. I hope that he will see fit to recommend the Committee to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the proposal interesting. I would not say that it was modest, because clearly it implies a substantial change from present practice. While I do not like the wording of the amendment, it appears that it provides the germ of an excellent idea, if it is worked on. I do not go along with some of the arguments that have been adduced, but there are strong arguments for having a system of deferred starts to prison sentences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that only Holland has that system— I believe that Austria has such a system, and also the United States. In Austria, I know of a case where an Italian visitor was sentenced by the Austrian courts. He was sent away for call-up later and naturally absconded out of Austria, which delighted the Austrian authorities. He now will never return to Austria because the moment he does he will be put in prison. In that way the Austrians disposed of an Italian who, subsequently, was in trouble in Britain where we do not have such a sensible system. They got rid of that miscreant without the Austrian taxpayer having to pay the costs of maintaining him in an Austrian prison. He absconded before his term of imprisonment was due to begin.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Home Secretary could do with extra arrows in his bow with regard to the overcrowding of prisons. A power, to be exercised by the courts to postpone the commencement of prison sentences at times of heavy overcrowding, could give the prison service some leeway. Clearly, we would have to be careful about the people to whom we said " Go home and we will call on you later ". It may be that we could not do that for major offenders. But it would be a useful additional weapon in helping to relieve the strain on prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the wording of any such provision could include a discretion for the court to allow delay in the commencement of sentence for other reasons, some of which have been mentioned in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will think about the idea. The present system of deferral of sentences really has nothing in common with what is proposed here. With the present system, no sentence is passed on the offender. He is sent away for up to six months and he has a good idea that, if he keeps his copybook clean, no custodial sentence will be passed. Accordingly, he has less incentive to run away from the court and from authority. He knows that if he has been a good lad he will not go to prison after the six months. A person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment will know that when they get their call-up papers they will have to serve it. There is a greater risk of people absconding in those circumstances. None the less, the system appears to work elsewhere and it could help to relieve congestion in the prison population. That is the major argument for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
It has been said that another reason is that it is a back door to bail pending appeal. I am not certain that the new clause is an appropriate way to deal with the problem of bail pending appeal. That should be considered under a separate head. I can think of circumstances where there should be bail pending appeal which could be given under this clause, very wisely and properly. I can also see an automatic requesting of delay—it would be human nature not to want to go to prison in a hurry—not for an appeal, but to abscond. I would prefer bail pending appeal to be dealt with in a clause that relates to the special circumstances surrounding that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know of anybody who has suggested that this should be a means of obtaining bail pending appeal by the back door. We do not need to attempt to obtain it by the back door. New clause 26, which the hon. and learned Gentleman has signed, would deliver the granting of bail pending appeal. If we want to achieve that, we shall do so when we debate and vote on that new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman's every word, save the reference to the fact that no one has raised the matter.

I understand that the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) agreed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As arguments seem to be centring around me, perhaps I could make it clear to the hon. and learned Gentleman that I am certainly not putting forward this proposal as a substitute for bail pending appeal. I said that if the system were in operation, one of the advantages might be in cases where there is a delay in obtaining a transcript. It would enable the defendant and his legal advisers to consider whether an appeal was justified. In such circumstances the case of the potential appellant would be facilitated by this system. That is all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says in clarifying the misconception of his hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to comment on whether there should be a penalty for someone who does not attend when called to serve his sentence. That issue would have to be considered very carefully indeed. If the only sanction for not attending to serve one's sentence is that one could be arrested and then serve it, there is very little incentive effectively to attend to serve that sentence promptly. That raises the question whether there should be a sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a sanction, we might end up with a situation where persons are serving longer in prison than would otherwise have been the case. That matter must be examined and cannot be glossed over. We do not want people to serve longer by virtue of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
None the less there are occasions when the deferment of the start of a sentence might be sensible, wise and humane and might relieve the congestion of the prison system. For those reasons, I ask the Minister to think about the idea, even if he cannot accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the appallingly overcrowded conditions in some of our local prisons, it is important that serious consideration is giver, to any proposal that may reduce the prison population without, at the same time, endangering the public. The new clause moved by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich (Mr. Silkin) is clearly within that category. It is, as he himself said, a modest proposal. It is limited in its scope and will not have a major or revolutionary impact upon the prison population. However, it would make a useful contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause will enable the courts to defer the beginning of a custodial sentence when it appears appropriate to do so. That recommendation has been made by the parliamentary All-Party Penal Affairs Group. It was also recommended by the Advisory Council on the Penal System as long ago as 1974. The Advisory Council envisaged circumstances, where it might be unavoidable to impose a custodial sentence, but where it was thought that there were good reasons why that custodial sentence should not be imposed immediately. It cited examples of an offender who had committed an offence that must be punished with a custodial sentence. However, he was not a danger to the community and was not likely to abscond or commit any of the offences in section 1 of the Bail Act. He, perhaps, had to make important personal dispositions, such as undergoing a long-awaited surgical operation, taking important examinations or making arrangements with his family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, it does not seem at all unreasonable or inappropriate that the courts should have the power to defer the beginning of the sentence. It would enable the prisons to plan their numbers more effectively, especially if they operated the call-up system that works effectively in Holland. It would also enable the individual offender to plan his life effectively. As the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) said, it would enable the offender to obtain more considered and relaxed legal advice on the possibilities of appeal or of obtaining bail pending the hearing of an appeal. It is highly unsatisfactory that a person who has been on bail pending a trial should, as not infrequently happens now, serve part or even the whole of the sentence and then have it quashed on appeal. That is far more relevant than the argument about whether this is a back door method of obtaining bail, pending appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among others, two main criteria seem to have featured in our debates. First, we have assessed proposals on whether they would actually contribute to a reduction in the prison population and, secondly, on whether they limit the discretion of the courts. New clause 17 satisfies both those criteria
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
in a way that the Minister would want them to do. First, it reduces the prison population and might allow it to be planned in a more manageable and more sensible fashion. Secondly, it increases the area of discretion available to the courts. On those two grounds, as well as the other more formidable grounds advanced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dulwich, I hope the Minister will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman also agree that in addition to giving such power to the courts, there is an argument for giving power to the Home Secretary to defer the start of sentences? It is a separate issue, but could often achieve the same result, especially where prisons are overcrowded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilroy-Silk</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that is so, but having seen the grimaces on the Minister's face during the hon. and learned Gentleman's intervention and at other stages of our debate, I do not want to cloud the issue now. I am more concerned with supporting my hon. and learned Friend's new clause and getting it accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is possible and desirable to have Executive deferment of sentence perhaps we can debate that on another occasion I hope that the Minister will accede to the arguments adduced by my right hon. and learned Friend and accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Accrington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been going over much familiar ground during our debate on the need for probation reports, which we debated at some length on a different clause. If nothing else, it is stimulating to discuss a new concept of sentencing policy—certainly new for this Committee and new with regard to the law in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will produce some cogent and well-argued reasons for not accepting this novel concept now, but I do not doubt that in a few years time it will be introduced. Years ago the thought of suspended sentences, deferred sentences, and community service would have been regarded as revolutionary, unworkable and quite likely to shake the whole fabric of society. Those methods are now part of this country's law and, in fact, rather old hat. We have been debating minor improvements here and there upon matters that are now generally accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that too much should be expected from the deferment of the start of custodial sentences, unlike the hon. and learned Gentleman, I was quite attracted to the arguments for the new clause— especially the argument that it would be a backdoor method of obtaining bail pending appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph on deferred commencement of custodial sentences in the All-Party Penal Affairs booklet " Too Many Prisoners " states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He should also be able to obtain considered legal advice on the possibilities of an appeal and of obtaining bail pending the hearing of an appeal. It is highly unsatisfactory that a person who has been on bail pending trial should, as happens under the existing system, serve
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
part or even the whole of his sentence, which is subsequently quashed on appeal."</p></blockquote>
It is offensive that someone who has been on bail, who is then sentenced, who serves that sentence and whose appeal is then successful has had the humiliating and dreadful experience of serving a prison sentence when, in fact, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is clearly that that sentence should not have been passed. If the new clause goes some small way to removing that particular injustice, it will be justification for the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explore that thought. If that is put forward as the reason for the new clause, the logical extension would be that deferment should always last for as long as it is necessary to decide an appeal against sentence, or indeed against conviction. Is that what is envisaged? That would extend the waiting period enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not putting that forward. I am not going beyond what is said here—
	<br><blockquote><p>"He should also be able to obtain considered legal advice on the possibilities of an appeal and of obtaining bail pending the hearing of an appeal."</p></blockquote>
I am not putting the argument on a stronger basis than that. But if it goes some way to remedying the injustice caused by that set of circumstances, it is some justification for the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main justification is that it would enable somebody to have the starting date of his prison sentence deferred in circumstances that would benefit his family and would not cause his sins to plague them. It is a shattering experience for anyone to be sent to prison, and it is also a shattering experience for the family. There is not point in pretending otherwise. It is not only the person himself who suffers, but the family—particularly the close family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that family is going through a bad time anyway, perhaps through illness or business difficulties, it should not be beyond the wit of the courts to devise a system whereby someone who is not likely to abscond but will turn up to serve the commencement of sentence to have that sentence deferred so that his business difficulties could be overcome for a few weeks or the illness allowed to pass and the shattering experience not exaggerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's reply. Of course, it is a new idea and I would not expect him suddenly to leap and accept it. None the less—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the hon. and learned Gentleman intently, I wonder whether he is making rather more of this than is necessary.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an absurd intervention! I did not suggest anything of the sort.

	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate—not least the intervention of the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) who said that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary should have more limbs. I thought that might be so that he might better take up arms against a sea of troubles. When he went on to say that the Home Secretary should take Executive powers to postpone the date upon which a sentence passed by the courts should begin, I thought that that only served to increase the trouble. The Home Secretary would not be grateful for either of those well-meant suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Home Secretary is taking powers in the Bill to decide the date when a sentence should end, why should he not decide when it should begin? What is the greater trouble?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We think that it is only in the most rare of circumstances, and never exercised under the provisions of the Imprisonment (Temporary Provisions) Act, that the Home Secretary would wish at all to intervene. Where a court has passed a sentence, he certainly would not wish to say that it should not begin yet-awhile. The idea that lies behind the new clause is relatively new, but not one to cause me to shrink from it. It proposes that someone on bail should be able to request the court to defer the date on which the sentence should begin. The right hon. and learned Gentleman and other hon. Members said that they are not going for a full-blown deferment system, but simply giving the court power to respond to a request from someone who has already been on bail—and only to someone who has been on bail—that he should be given some leeway before he starts his sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is well worth consideration, and has received support from wholly respectable sources. But it has been put forward on the basis of humanitarianism and the proper use of prison resources. I cannot see that, in the way in which it would apply under the new clause, there is anything really significant to be said for it on humanitarian grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced with someone who has been on bail, been convicted and sentenced to custody. Anyone who has been on bail has had to face the possibility that he may end up in prison. He knows that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
has committed an imprisonable offence. He has had ample opportunity to arrange his affairs in the way it is suggested he should do during the period in which he would be allowed to have his sentence deferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see a marginal case in which it could be said that it would be kinder to allow him some time here but I do not believe that the humanitarian argument in the circumstances in which the new clause is drafted really amounts to very much at all. It is interesting, too, that this has not been argued on humanitarian grounds in any of the representations that have been made to the Home Office, so I am not persuaded on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. S. C. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister is not including the report of the advisory council on the penal system because that council certainly argues it on a humanitarian basis. One passage of the report gives an example of a person who is about to undergo a surgical operation which, after examination, proved that it would take a long time. However much one may be on bail, normally one is not in a position to defer matters of that kind. They may involve very short deferment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I said that it is possible to see a marginal case for humanitarian reasons but not one of great substance. In an emergency one can see a case but in the ordinary event—the hon. and learned Member for Accring-ton (Mr. Davidson) kept referring to the shattering experience of going to prison—if one is sentenced then one has to go to prison sometime. It is no less shattering to go at the end of a fortnight's deferment or two months, or three months, than it is to go, having been on bail, having come up for trial and having found that that which had been anticipated as a possibility has come to pass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not concerned about minimising the shattering experience for the criminal. My concern is with limiting, if at all possible, the shattering experience for the family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman says and he puts it very fairly. But the courts are able to take into account family matters as matters of mitigation. They are a perfectly proper consideration to advance in mitigation and there are circumstances where a court takes the view that the affect on the family would be such that it would just tip the balance in favour of a non-custodial sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could take much longer over this if I read the brief but I am seeking to answer the debate as the arguments occur to me and, having paid careful attention, I do not believe that the humanitarian argument is sufficient to justify adding this discretion at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ormskirk said that this met the criterion of giving increased discretion to the courts wherever possible, but I have never argued that the courts should be given discretion for discretion's sake. There has to be sound argument advanced in terms of the management of resources
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
if we are to see a case established for making this change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our problem with the management of the resources of prison accommodation is that we have too little of it. I am not sure whether it is right to describe the pressure as being a pressure of demand. It is certainly demand on the part of the courts but one cannot say that it is demand on the part of those who are sent there. Far too many people are being required by order of the court to take up accomodation, having regard to the amount of accommodation available. It is said that this will help the overcrowding problem. For the life of me, I cannot see how it will help the overcrowding problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take a standard case. Someone is on bail. He is sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. He makes his request and the court agrees that it has not taken account of the fact that the offender has not yet got his business affairs sorted out, or that he has family difficulties as a result of which he does not go to prison for four months. How will that actually take the strain off prisons—save to the extent that that man will not go into prison for four months? At the end of four months he has to go into prison. Meanwhile, others will be treated in the same way and all that one is doing is putting back the moment where the prison accommodation has to take the strain. This will not help on the overcrowding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Dutch system there is a substantial backlog. I understand that over the last five years the average figure of people actually waiting to go into prison is 10,000. I appreciate that that is a thoroughgoing deferment or queueing system, not a limited one which the new clause provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During an earlier intervention I asked the hon. and learned Gentleman what were the consequences within the Dutch system. He said that the all-party penal affairs group found that there were no complaints in Holland about that but I suppose it depends on what one is prepared to put up with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Holland is that between one-third and one-quarter of the roughly 10,000 offenders who are waiting to take up their sentences are not traced when the time comes for them to go into prison—in other words, when someone blows the whistle and says "Come on in".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the research establishes that the police are, at any one time, trying to trace this proportion of those who are due to begin their sentences—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—I am asked where all this comes from. I understand that it comes from research carried out by Dr. Downes of the London School of Economics into the Dutch criminal justice system, as yet unpublished but so far communicated to the Home Office. I cannot pretend that I am au fait with that myself but that is where the figure comes from.

I do not believe that this country would be at all happy with the kind of backlog that that figure represents in the criminal justice system in a country

not disimilar from our own, and there would be great demands after a while for a kind of amnesty. Indeed, as I indicated, some 10 per cent, of these people waiting to go into prison receive a pardon— a pardon plainly given for administrative reasons and not on the merits of the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend have any idea of the cost of trying to trace these people that make up the backlog who may have disappeared?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I do not, but I am grateful for the intervention because it enables me to talk about the wider implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a full system of queueing were implemented here as in Holland, a considerable burden would be imposed on the police because of the need to trace offenders who abscond or who fail to appear at the appointed time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, say, 10 per cent, of the 47,000 people sentenced to immediate imprisonment had had their sentence deferred and if our experience ran on similar lines to that in Holland, the police would have had to deal with nearly 1,000 defaulters. Whatever savings might might be made on transport costs—and these would not be as significant as might be supposed—it would still be necessary to provide transport from the point of surrender to the prison for those whose sentences had been postponed to reimburse their travelling costs. All costs in that area, therefore, would be likely to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to give the impression that I have dealt in a cavalier way with this proposal. It has clearly been seriously considered and advanced and I could have dealt more comprehensively with the issue had I ploughed through the carefully prepared arguments which leave nothing unanswered. However, I think at this time of night it is sensible to try to answer a debate in a more informal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do take the two criteria—the humanitarian one and the resource management one—but I must say, for the reasons that I have given, that I am not persuaded that it would be right at this juncture to legislate for this additional power. The debate has certainly been thought-provoking and we do not want to say that the door would for ever be closed on any further discussion. We shall want to continue to discuss it, but for the reasons I have given I hope that the Committee will see that the Government do not feel that they ought to change the Bill in this regard at the moment, and I am afraid that if the clause were to be pressed I should have to advise the Committee to resist it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would not accuse the Minister of dealing with this matter in a cavalier fashion. I would say, in a dismissive fashion but not a cavalier fashion and, despite the last few words he uttered, leaving the door slightly ajar so that one could see just a chink of light through it for the future when perhaps a less dismissive Government are in office, I must say that his general approach disappointed me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, if one were dealing with the kinds of figures which I gather an academic in England presented to the Home Office on the position in
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
Holland, that would be a very important consideration and one which the all-party penal affairs group would have taken very much into consideration before making these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had the good fortune to receive our information direct from the Netherlands and the Netherlands prison system. The proportions which my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk and I gave were the proportions which were given to us on the review that took place in 1978, and we have heard nothing to suggest that those figures have changed in the meantime, nor have we heard anything, except what the Minister told us a moment ago, to suggest that they have altered since the publication of " Too Many Prisoners " in June 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This remains a matter which has to be looked at and, having heard what the Minister said about this academic gentleman's researches and the information that he has given to the Home Office, we shall certainly, as a group, wish to make our own inquiries and find out what the prison department in the Netherlands says about the figures there. If the figures are as bad as the Minister has told us in a system where, as he himself accepted, the breadth of the deferment provisions is far greater than anything that we are suggesting in the new clause, I am bound to say that I am somewhat amazed that they are still continuing with the system and that the amount of police time, transport hours, manhours, mileage and so on spent in tracing the people who apparently disappear without trace have not persuaded them to give up the system altogether. We shall look into it and maybe we shall find some other occasion, if our researches disprove the figures the Minister related to the Committee, when we shall be able to inform the House of what the Netherlands authorities themselves say. If the Minister is right we shall take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal briefly with the question of the effect on the prison population. I did not put it as a matter of very great moment, but certainly I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk that it is a matter of some moment. Here again it seems that the Minister was being unnecessarily dismissive. I agree that what this is doing is to defer the sentences of a number of people, and, as time goes on, it will even itself out and the prison population on average will remain the same as it would otherwise be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall that in a previous debate it was suggested by the Opposition that the courts ought to be armed with a great deal more information than they have at present about the extent to which the overused facilities both in prison and in other forms of custodial establishments are being used. I myself remember putting it to the Minister and receiving a great deal of sympathy for the suggestion that those figures should be available to the courts on a day-to-day basis. I can well believe that, if this were done, the court in a particular area would be more likely to be sympathetic to an approach or request of the kind envisaged by this new clause if the local facilities were overcrowded at the time, and would be less crowded in a few
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1981-1982V001P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
weeks' time than they would be in other circumstances. There is a factor there; I do not put it particularly high, but it is a factor which ought to be taken into account to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to the major factor, which is one which the Minister described as humanitarian—I do not know whether he was using the word in a dismissive sense, but I certainly would not use it— we are dealing with people in this context who have been regarded as sufficiently trustworthy to be allowed bail pending their trial. We are dealing with people who in many cases may be first offenders, because the courts will have the power to decide which people will be enabled to take advantage of the provisions; we are dealing with people who may have committed an offence which justifies a prison sentence, but for whom or for whose family courts none the less have sympathy. I would regard this as a very important humanitarian consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go further than that and put it in this way. The court may in certain circumstances have to decide whether the background, the information about the offender and his family and his circumstance are such that it is right to make a decision whether to impose a custodial penalty. It may be very much a matter of balance. The courts may well take the view that the offence is one which it cannot really overlook from the point of view of a custodial penalty in the ordinary way. Humanitarian factors are advanced on behalf of the defendant and the Minister says " Of course the court is entitled to take into account mitigating factors ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court may very well in those circumstances say to itself "Here are factors which we take into account—the effect upon the family or perhaps the much more traumatic effect on the individual offender himself, because of the fact that he will miss an examination which is vital to his future career for what may be a relatively short sentence." The Minister quite rightly says that in those circumstances a court may say to itself, " Because of those mitigating factors we shall not impose a custodial penalty at all."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the situation without this power. If a court had this power, and the circumstances were such that the court felt that the public interest required that a custodial penalty should be one which should be suffered by the defendant, but it was in a position to defer the operation of that penalty so that the major traumatic effects of it would not be suffered, whether by the defendant himself or by his family, it could be eased so that the factor mitigating against a custodial penalty would be avoided by a deferment of that kind. Surely that
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
would be something which would enable a court to do its duty both to the public and the offender in a much better and more sensible way than if the court is not given a power of that kind. So there is, in my view, a very strong and important both humanitarian factor and factor of public interest involved here, and the Minister should not be dismissive about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done my best to reply to the points the Minister made. I appreciate, of course, that anything new of this kind is bound to cause a certain amount of administrative inconvenience and expenditure of resources. I know one has to weigh that up against the expenditure of the same resources on other desirable improvements to the penal system. What concerns me is the way the Minister, replying to these proposals, suggested that, despite the chink of light, he and the Home Office generally do not regard this as being a really desirable penal reform, quite apart from the administrative problems, if any, that it might cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, I am bound to say, is an approach which I find most regrettable and one which, I am also bound to say, in fairness to the Home Secretary and the Minister, I have not found in many of the other matters that we have discussed in the course of these debates. I can only put it down perhaps to the influence upon the Minister's mind of the figures which he has, but which we at the moment find quite unacceptable in accordance with our information, and perhaps the novelty and imaginative element of this proposal which to Conservative minds unfortunately is always something to be resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have given the proposal a substantial airing. I regret that the invitation which I extended to Conservative Members, other than the Minister himself, to participate in what we regard as a debate of importance, has not been one that they have accepted other than by the absurd intervention of one hon. Member from the Back Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the level, I am afraid, of many Conservative Members on this Committee—fortunately, not all of them. On a serious, important and imaginative issue of this kind they confine their intervention to the kind of thing which we had from the hon. Gentleman. However, Mr. Watkins, in the circumstances we have aired the matter. We may at some stage in the future return to it, but in the meantime I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
