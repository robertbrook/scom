	<i>Question proposed [23rd June],</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we rose yesterday I was just finishing our discussion on the Question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill". There were two very small things that I wanted to say. One was in answer to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan), who asked me if telephone communications between registrars' offices would not cover the problem. It is made clear in Clause 14 that an informant must attend personally at the registrar's office where the registration is to be made, and Clause 13 makes it clear that births can be registered in one of two districts only, either where the birth takes place or where the parent lives. Telephone information alone cannot constitute the information the registrar needs. It has to be personal attendance, and one could not cover this by telephone information. If, however, the informant lived some distance away, the registrar would try to find an informant who would not have to travel such a distance. It would be only in the case of absolute necessity that this kind of move would be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) had asked how a decree granted under Clause 16(3) could be enforced against an informant who was resident in England. Circumstances might well arise where a married couple had a child in Scotland and removed to England before the child was registered. The practical answer to this is that it is intended to instruct registrars that they should not normally serve notice on
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
people no longer resident in Scotland. If the father or mother had removed, they would be treated as being unable to give the right particulars and the registrar would pursue one or other of the requirements under Clause 14. It would be unusual for the registrar not to find a qualified informant in Scotland. It would be unlikely in 99 out of 100 cases that the registrar would have to ask an informant to come a long distance. This then is my answer to the points raised on Clause 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point with which the hon. Lady has just dealt, I do not see how a court would pronounce a decree on a summary application if the informant was in England, because the court would not have jurisdiction to do that. I do not see how the registrar could have got an order by the court to apply to someone outwith the jurisdiction of the court. May I ask how Clause 16 is likely to work? I have some doubts how it will. The Clause gives power to the registrar to require certain qualified informants to apply personally and to give the information which he has not already been given under the terms of Clause 14. How is the registrar to know that the birth has taken place if he has not been informed by the mother or father of the child or by some other informants? As far as the other informants are concerned, under Clause 14(1, b) they are only obliged to give information in the case of the death or inability of either the father or mother. If neither the father nor the mother gives the information, and therefore there is no statutory jurisdiction on any of the other qualified informants to give it, how is the registrar going to know that the child has been born and thereby exercise the statutory power that he has under Clause 16(1)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing specifically new about this provision in the Bill. It has worked very well for 100 years. The Registrar General gets his information from a medical officer of health or a hospital and this is how he is able to try to track down cases where the birth has not been registered. This has been in practice for 100 years and I do not think there is any need to worry that in the course of the next 10 years or so this procedure will suddenly collapse. It is not a new provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it is not a new provision and I am satisfied with the explanation which the hon. Lady has given that the information comes from medical officers of health and from hospitals so that the registrar gets information in one way or another, by gossip or in other ways, that the child has been born.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that we have to move this Amendment because it has been the "Register of Corrected Entries" since 1860. I have the original document here which, if it had not been for capital gains tax, might well be worth a mint of money at Sotheby's. In 1860 it was the "Register of Corrected Entries" and it seems strange that one should want to change it now. In the current instructions to registrars it is still the "Register of Corrected Entries", under Section F, (1), (2), (3) and (4). The hon. Lady will have to give a good explanation why she wants to change this time-honoured term of registrars to "Register of Corrections, Etc.", which seems most unparliamentary, though it may cover a multitude of sins which we hope it will not. The original document is very clear, all about using no blotting paper and stating that no flourishes or ornaments are to be placed in the register. It seems a pity to change this historic document with no apparent reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I freely confess that I can well understand why the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) has put down the Amendment. I admit there is a real difficulty and perhaps when I explain it hon. Members will understand and sympathise, and perhaps even be prepared to withdraw their Amendment. If I may look back, the Register of Corrected Entries was created by the 1854 Act for the purpose of recording correct particulars in cases where the original entries, whether for births, deaths or marriages,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
contained errors. It was what it said it was, a register of corrected entries. In practice, through the years however, there has been certain informal developments and the register has come to be used not only as a means of recording corrections but also for the recording of other events subsequent to registration such as decrees of divorce, decrees of paternity and bigamy convictions, and all sorts of other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 43 provides that in future the register will be used for recording changes of name and surname. Therefore, the title "Register of Corrected Entries" is no longer a correct title because it will record something rather different from and additional to corrected entries. So here we have a difficulty of finding a phrase which correctly represents what the position will be and accurately describes the functions of the registrar. At the same time, as the hon. Member for Dumfries has very rightly said, the initials "R.C.E." are almost part of the stock in trade of registrars. Deprive them of R.C.E, and they will be in great difficulty because it is how they have known the thing for 100 years, and it has been used, as the hon. Member suggests, in marginal annotations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Bill comes into operation on 1st January, 1966, some of the insertions in the register will refer to original registered entries made after that date, but others will refer to original registered entries befor 1966. Unless we could find a way of keeping the initials "R.C.E." we should have two sets of initials in use in these marginal annotations and throughout the whole work of the registrars, and this would be a real difficulty. So we have tried very hard—I have racked my brains and so has everybody else—to find another word beginning with "E" that would allow us to keep "R.C.E." and yet would be an accurate description of what this would be. The Committee has to decide whether it will bear the slight indignity of having "etc." in the Bill or whether it will deprive the Registrar General and the registrars of their happy association with the intials "R.C.E." Having said that, I must confess that I find myself unwilling to make the registrars and the Registrar General so unhappy as they would be if we took away their "E." Therefore, I find myself prepared to tolerate the use of the "Etc." because it means we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
an accurate description and because they can keep their "R.C.E." That is my explanation of why we have this word "Etc." and I hope the Committee will find it possible to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Lady has said is that there will not only be a correction but that this will cover what one might describe as additions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a much better explanation than I had expected and it was one that had not occurred to me. I expect that my hon. Friends will be perfectly happy with it. I dare say, from what the hon. Lady has said, that they will not be unwilling, if we can have another word beginning with "E," perhaps before the Report stage, to accept the Amendment then. I am sure that she will allow me to say that what is rather a strange, quaint and archaic title is not exactly in keeping with what we understand is the dynamic approach of the Labour Party. Be that as it may, I suspect that my hon. Friend will wish to withdraw their Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the difficulty with the letter "E" or with the letter "C"? I understand that this is more than a Register of Corrected Entries and includes all sorts of other things. Would it be possible to call it a "Register of Comprehensive Entries."? This would keep the "E" and the "C" and everybody would be happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh D. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to enter into this fundamental issue of party manifestoes at the next election, but I should like to ask a question on Clause 19. Would this be the appropriate time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 19 will come up shortly and then the hon. Member can raise any point he desires. The Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill" will be moved at some point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that "etc." is such an important word, and, in view of the reasonable explanation which the hon. Lady has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Clause 19.—(FREE ABBREVIATED CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that it is a few years since I registered a birth and I think most people will have forgotten how it is done. I take it that this is one of the major changes in registration that will come from the passing of the Bill. No one registering a birth will get a full certificate and will only get a full certificate on request and by payment. There is certainly desirability in having a shortened certificate. I wonder whether it will be generally accepted in the sense that we are hoping it will be. Would it complicate matters if someone wanted a full certificate if they were able to get it on request without payment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the hon. Lady one or two questions. I entirely agree with the hon. Member that this is one of the important changes in the system. On Second Reading I made my views clear when, on balance, I came down firmly in favour of the abbreviated certificate. The reason, of course, is that the name of the father of an illegitimate child may not appear on the full birth certificate without the father's consent unless a paternity decree has been granted against him. The full certificate without the father's name on it tells its own story and it could be embarrassing and unfortunate for the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) said during the Second Reading debate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not the first time that the House of Commons has considered the problem of young people, who on entering the professions or other job, are somewhat embarrassed and in some instances—I hesitate to use the word 'penalised'—or handicapped by the fact that their personal papers the word 'illegitimate' apears."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 27th May, 1965; c. 35.]</p></blockquote>
I would like to comment on this solely for the record. Presumably, by the expression "personal papers" the hon. Member meant the full birth certificate. A registrar in my own constituency has told me that in no case since the year 1919 has the word appeared, and therefore there can be no young people who are being penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to ask the hon. Lady if there is any real objection to the issuing
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
of the full certificate as well. I do not imagine that the cost would be considerable and I do not believe that this is supposed to be a money-making exercise. There are two reasons for urging this. I do not know how many bodies there are, but I suspect that some still demand the full certificate. To get a passport one does not need a full certificate and the authorities will accept an abbreviated one. However, there will be certain organisations who will want a full birth certificate, and as a matter of convenience I think there is a case for issuing the full one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and everyone in this Committee should take pride in this, the Scottish birth registration system has just about the highest reputation of any country in the world for the accuracy of the information which it gives. Thirdly, and this is a most significant point which is based on the information which came to me from the registrar in my constituency, purely out of ignorance of their parentage which was due to the abbreviated birth certificates a disaster was only just averted. The registrar said in a letter to me,
	<br><blockquote><p>"For example, in a recent case a half-brother and half-sister were prevented from marrying each other with only a day to spare thanks largely to production of the full birth certificates. Both parties were illegitimate with the same mother but different fathers."</p></blockquote>
This is not the sort of thing which would happen often and it is possibly like a grain of sand on the beach. Nevertheless, it is something about which we should take great care. Will the hon. Lady consider sympathetically the continuation of the free full extract which is given at the moment together with the abbreviated document? This could be of great benefit and would cover all objections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in judicial proceedings in which the circumstances of the birth are important the court will only accept the full certificate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for coming in again and for not having done enough homework. Could my hon. Friend confirm that there are Government Departments which still require a full certificate for the purpose of claims? There may be certain circumstances in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
which we would totally defeat the object of this exercise if Government Departments insisted on full certificates. I do not think the question of the charge is important. It is the establishment of the acceptance of the shortened certificate which is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will reply to the last point straightaway. I do not know what Departments demand, but I will find out. It is relevant to ensure that the abbreviated certificate is acceptable to Government Departments and I will certainly undertake to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all agreed that the purpose of this Clause is to help the illegitimate child who at the moment finds his normal birth certificate is different from the normal certificate of other people. We want to encourage an attitude which regards the abbreviated certificate as being the normal one. We cannot give to the illegitimate child the kind of details that would enable him to have a full certificate so the only way to get uniformity is to use the abbreviated one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How far would that purpose be defeated if at the same time, as the hon. Member has suggested, we were to issue a full extract as well as an abbreviated one? My own view is that we would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise. If parents are offered both kinds of certificate or a full one or an abbreviated one they will ask for the full one. We would then not be able to establish the kind of results which are the purpose of this Clause. Nevertheless, we do not want to discourage people from getting a full certificate if they want to. The registrar will tell the informants at the time of registration that they can obtain a full extract on payment of the appropriate fee and it may be that a large proportion of informants will pay for and get the full certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the registrar issued a full certificate free it would be difficult to justify this not just on economic grounds because, as the hon. Gentleman said, the cost is not very great. But we would find it difficult to justify it in terms of consistency between Scotland and England. In England there is no free issue at all. By getting an abbreviated certificate free Scottish people will have something that the English do not have. Also the purpose of the Clause would be largely
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
defeated and I would not be justified in agreeing with the hon. Member. On reflection, he will perhaps agree that the purpose we share—the need to help the illegitimate child—must be what determines our attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced or sympathetic with the hon. Lady's argument that it would be difficult to justify because the English do not do it. I dare say, having argued earlier for consistency, it is slightly inconsistent of me to say that we should do something which the English do not. This is not quite the same, however, as it takes us back to the efficiency of the Scottish registration system. I cannot see any objection and, if the cost is not a major item, surely this will not impose a great burden on the registrars. This would take us a long way to maintaining the reputation which we have and which I understand is higher than the registration system in England and Wales.

This is a purely drafting Amendment. Some of the provisions in this part of the Bill are clearly not applicable to stillbirths and it is necessary to have these words in to cover the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wonder whether these words really are necessary. I appreciate the point made by the hon. Lady, but, of course, if the provision is not applicable it cannot apply. The subsection as originally drafted said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"this Part of this Act shall apply to stillbirths".</p></blockquote>
It could only apply if they were applicable, and with great respect it seems to me to be draftsmanship gone mad to insert such a finnicky Amendment to a subsection which at first sight appeared to be perfectly satisfactory. As no one wants superfluous language in a statutory provision, perhaps the hon. Lady will look at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might briefly further explain that, for example, Clause 15 refers only to foundlings and Clause 14 (2, 
	<i>b)</i> refers to persons having charge of the child, so unless we have these words in we think it would be a little difficult to make sense of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in page 13, line 40, to leave out "qualified informant" and to insert:

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that together with this Amendment should be discussed the Government Amendment in page 14, line 9, after "that" insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the best of his knowledge and belief".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under Clause 14(2), where the qualified informants are defined, these would be either any relative of either parent of the child having knowledge of the birth, or the occupier of the premises where the birth took place. I do not see how any of these people could certify that the child was not, in fact, born alive, or give the particulars which are asked for in Clause 21(2,a) and 
	<i>(b).</i> Therefore, I think that in the case of a still-birth it would be much more satisfactory, instead of saying "qualified informants" and realising that really these qualified informants may not be able to say what, in fact, they are asked to say, to say that it must be a person present at the birth, who presumably might well be a parent, a nurse or a doctor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has explained, the effect of this Amendment would be to cut out the father or other
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
relative as a qualified informant if he or she was not actually present at a birth which was a still-birth. In fact, the kind of declaration that the hon. Gentleman had in mind is very rarely required. None has been made in the last five years, when the average annual number of still-births was about 2,000. In the preceding 10 years there were only 15 declarations in all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might, nevertheless, be argued—and, indeed, I think the hon. Gentleman was really arguing this—that even in the rare case of an informant who was not present at the still-birth there should not be a requirement to make an unqualified declaration that the child was not born alive. The difficulty is that even a mother giving birth all alone to an apparently still-born child might not be absolutely sure whether the child was still-born or had died immediately afterwards. It is extremely difficult to judge this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think it would be unwise to accept this Amendment. The only possible informant might be the mother, and she might be dead. We think the better course would be to qualify the declaration, and the Amendment to subsection (2, 
	<i>b)</i> seeks to meet this point. It provides for a declaration by the informant that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, no medical practitioner or certified midwife was present and that the child was not born alive. In other words, it seeks to overcome the difficulty of imposing impossible requirements upon the informant. I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree that the Government Amendment meets the point satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally, I saw the object of the Government Amendment as soon as it was put down, and I think it probably followed on consideration of the Amendment put down by my hon. Friend. Would it not be better to put in a qualifying provision in similar terms to Clause 21(2,a) because as the hon. Lady has pointed out, someone present at the birth might not be absolutely certain that the child was born alive, and yet they are asked, in the absence of a medical practitioner or certified midwife, to deliver to the registrar a certificate in the prescribed form stating that the child was born alive. There might well be a case for putting a qualification in paragraph 
	<i>(a)</i> along the same lines as paragraph 
	<i>(b).</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think really under paragraph 
	<i>(a)</i> where we are concerned with the medical practitioner or the midwife who was present the same difficulty does not arise. When I said that it could be very difficult to know whether or not a child was stillborn I did not mean that it would be difficult for a medical person or a midwife but for the mother herself. I remember a case in my own constituency not long ago where difficulty arose because a mother thought that her baby had been alive at birth whereas the medical people knew that it had not. In paragraph (a) we are concerned not with a declaration that to the best of his knowledge and belief something occurred but with what is, in fact, a medical opinion, so I think we are quite safe in omitting it from paragraph (a).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I am not entirely happy about this. It seems to me to go very wide when it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any relative who has knowledge of the birth".</p></blockquote>
This may be somebody who had been told about it after it had happened, or the occupier of the premises. For example, how on earth could the owner of an hotel or a lodging house or rooms be expected to be able to certify this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have hoped that the hon. Lady might have given consideration to this point to see whether the suggestions made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) might not be worth considering before the Report stage, but I do not propose to press this Amendment.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite honestly, I do not think that the point raised would be covered by the suggestion made by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie). There is a difficulty here. Where one is considering a still-born child, if there happened not to be a medical person present at the birth there might well be a difficulty, but the figures I gave were meant to indicate the extent of the difficulty. It is really the facts of living and dying and being born that present the difficulty and the only real solution would be to make quite sure that there was never a child born without a medical person present. This
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
is what we try to achieve and, by and large, we are extremely successful in doing so, but the difficulty of registering a stillbirth on the isolated occasions when this occurs without medical people being present is not easily overcome.

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friends and myself has failed to take the high road again, but I would like to speak briefly on this because in many ways it is even more important from the point of view of convenience than the Amendment we were not allowed to bring forward on births.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all realise that death very often happens suddenly and relatives are naturally in a state of worry and deep concern, and the greater convenience we can make in registering a death in England when the family lives in Scotland, the better. I feel, perhaps, that my point could be met if the two Registrars General would get together and amend the regulations in some degree. The one that particularly worries people near the Border is that in D.21 of the Manual, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be noted that a period of four clear days must elapse after the day on which notification is received by the coroner. Thus if notice is received on the Monday the body is not removable until the following Saturday."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
This is a very long time for a family to wait for the funeral of their relative, and I feel that if somehow or other the coroners in England could come to an agreement about this the difficulty would be overcome. It would only boil down to the coroner in Carlisle and, presumably, the coroner in Berwick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the great interest that the hon. Lady has taken in this problem of the Border, and the help that she has given, perhaps she could find some way of bringing the regulations in England to a more satisfactory state of co-operation with the Registrar General in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, if there are police inquiries and there has been a sudden death the coroner has a right to take longer to make up his mind about giving a certificate to move the body back to Scotland, but probably in 999 cases out of 1,000 death has been by a normal cause and the regulation could be waived. I know, too, that the coroner is most helpful and in many cases he does waive this right, but I feel it is a pity that it should be in writing in the regulations and provide a source of some annoyance to people in Scotland who want to bring their loved ones back as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

These are meant to be a practical guide to the interpretation of regulations, and are not fixed for all time. It would be unfortunate if we got the impression that what he has been quoting are regulations that had been laid down in any long-standing way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having taken a particular look since we discussed this Bill in principle, I have made pages of notes on the variation of this question. There are four variations of double moves across the border.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment may be discussed the Amendment to Clause 25, page 16, line 32, leave out from "days" to "from" in line 34.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is really an attempt to simplify the statutory provisions which fall upon individual men and women and which should, in my submission, be framed so as to minimise any inconvenience or difficulty which may be occasioned, particularly in the circumstances of this part of the Act where the death of a relative, sometimes a very close relative, is concerned. As the Clause and the statutory provision stand, there is an obligation to attend personally and give to the registrar within eight days this information. There is inserted in the provision a further proviso:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or such other period, not being less than three days, as may be prescribed".</p></blockquote>
It seems to me in a matter of this nature that the Government ought to make up their minds what statutory period it is reasonable to accept for qualified informants to give this information. I would have thought eight days was adequate, and it will only complicate the position if regulations can be made prescribing different periods not being less than three days. I would have thought it was better from the point of view of the public that they should know quite clearly they have eight days, or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0847">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
whatever period is considered appropriate, within which there is statutory obligation to give to the registrar this information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the foreseeable future the period during which a death must normally be registered will remain eight days, but there is a very good reason for giving the Registrar General power to vary this period by regulation provided that the period should not be less than three days. I hope hon. Members opposite will appreciate the point. The eight-day period has often been criticised on the ground that it permits too long an interval to elapse between death and registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England a shorter period of five days is allowed, and even this has been criticised as being too long. The most recent criticism of the period during which deaths require to be registered was contained in the report, published in 1964 on "Deaths in the Community" by the Private Practice Committee of the British Medical Association. The report examined the system of medico-legal investigation of deaths in England and Wales with particular reference to the safeguards against undetected homicide and premature burial, and one of the strongest recommendations was that the time within which a death must be registered should be reduced to 48 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is considered that 48 hours would be too short a period to allow in Scotland, particularly in the rural and sparsely populated areas, hence the reason for proposing a minimum of three days in order to cover these difficulties. A period of three days would not cause any hardship because nearly every death is registered by the second day after the date of death. Where there is a good reason for delay beyond the specific period no penalty is imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The B.M.A. report is being studied in England and Wales by a departmental committee appointed by the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Much of the report has no relevance in Scotland, but some of the recommendations, such as the one we are considering, would have equal relevance to Scotland as to England. If the recommendation to reduce the period for registration is accepted on the English side of the Border we would want to be able to consider a reduction in the period in
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
Scotland. We cannot do it at the moment because the report is still being studied, but the Clause as it stands would allow us to do this without amending legislation. I agree that one ought to be quite specific in legislation, but here we have to wait a little longer before we are sure what the right period should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point on which I would like elucidation. As far as I understand Clause 26, this allows the Registrar General to accept a late registration, that is one after three months.

	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
If he decides to allow it he can accept particulars from a non-qualified informant provided he is satisfied the correct particulars are available. If one looks at the list of qualified informants which appears in Clause 23 it appears that an unqualified informant means that he is someone who is not a relative, he was not present at the death, he is not an executor or representative, he was not an occupier of the premises and is not any other person having knowledge of the particulars.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a point which rarely arises. I know the hon. Gentleman accepts this. It is very rare that a death is not registered during the normal period, and because this happens so rarely obviously it will have some unusual features. Of course, the Registrar General must be aware of all the circumstances before registration is permitted. Can I give one example? An extreme case would be a sailor who was washed ashore after a wreck, and whose body was discovered some long time after death. In that kind of situation there are two practical possibilities. One is that the death is not registered because there is no properly qualified informant, or else provision is made whereby the death may be registered, recognising there are exceptional features in the case. The whole of Clause 26 is to deal with this exceptional case and make certain that as long as he has made inquiries into it and believes the correct particulars concerning the death are available he is permitted to register it. Some provision for this kind of case must be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that as I read Clause 27 there is an apparent contradiction between subsections (2) and (3)? Subsection (2) says that a certificate must be given to the cemetery before the burial, but subsection (3) goes on to say
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
that if no certificate has been delivered to the cemetery before burial the cemetery superintendent must report this to the registrar within three days of the burial. I am not clear how any burial can take place if subsection (2) has been observed and if a certificate has to go to the cemetery first. It seems to me an unnecessarily clumsy way of doing this. I suspect that in 99 cases out of 100 the certificate is given to the cemetery before burial, although I understand that under Scottish law there is nothing to stop a burial taking place without a certificate. I believe this is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there any reason why subsection (3) should be included? It would appear to be so much tidier to say that in future that there must be a certificate before burial, particularly now that things are to be made easier for the registration of deaths and a certificate may be issued at the home of the deceased person rather than the place where death occurred.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask what is the present procedure? Clearly this Clause deals with deaths about which there may be some doubt as to the cause. I repeat the view which I hold very firmly that the Scottish system is much better in cases of this kind than that which obtains in England, in that it causes much less pain to the relatives. There are not all the formalities of coroners' inquests and so on which take place elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My impression is that the main channel of communication is outlined in Clause 28 and appears to be between the registrar and the procurator-fiscal. In the case of doubt the registrar, presumably, can hear only from a doctor. Surely when this happens the channel is always between the doctor and the procurator-fiscal or conceivably the doctor and the police. It seems strange that this channel is merely mentioned in subsection (2) and the whole emphasis seems to be placed on the procurator-fiscal and the registrar. In subsection (2) it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a procurator-fiscal receives, otherwise than from a registrar…"</p></blockquote>
I should have thought it unusual for the procurator-fiscal to hear cases of this kind other than from a doctor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made inquiries of my own doctor about what action he takes if he is in the least doubtful about the cause of death. He tells me that if one of his patients dies suddenly and he has not seen the patient within a period of three weeks, he telephones to the procurator-fiscal, who inquires, for example, whether there has been any heart condition. If the doctor says, "I am certain that this is heart trouble with which I have been dealing for six weeks", the procurator-fiscal says, "That is all right, you can sign a death certificate and I shall be perfectly happy." The doctor tells me that he does not approach the registrar, for the registrar to go to the procurator-fiscal. It would seem that this Clause is not dealing with events as they happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions in the Clause are substantially the same as the existing law. The only difference is a slight simplification of the paper work. Where in subsection (2) the procurator-fiscal receives information otherwise than from the registrar about a death, it may, for example, be in the case of
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
homicide. The procurator-fiscal may receive the information not directly from a doctor or the registrar, but from someone who discovered the body. Information from the police may not necessarily come from the police surgeon. This would be the kind of situation where the procurator-fiscal would be obliged to send to the registrar a notice containing the information. This is the same as the existing law but as in the case of our previous discussions this would relate to an exceptional case where there may be some difficulty. So far this kind of provision has enabled all contingencies to be met satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that there is an ambiguity in this Clause. Various copies are mentioned here and in subsequent Clauses. Presumably, at least one of the purposes of making a copy is in case the original should be destroyed. I wonder whether it is wise for a duplicate, or copy, to be retained in the custody of the district registrar. It seems to me better that the Registrar General should keep the copy. I do not want to anticipate the provisions in future Clauses, and there may well be another reason for having these copies made. I understand that the registers go to the Registrar General after an examiner has paid a visit and it might be useful and convenient for the district registrar to have a copy of the documents while they are away. Perhaps the Minister can deal with these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->

This Clause will permit the kind of administrative arrangements which are necessary for the xerographic process to be carried out and the necessary functions of the Registrar General in relation to the registers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again on the subject of copies, is the sending of the register to the Registrar General what might be called a routine calling-in for inspection, or is it something quite special? In other words, does the phrase, "in accordance with directions", apply to the examiner endorsing as well as transmitting? I am puzzled when I look at the provisions in Clause 35 (2). Does the Registrar General send the registers back again if he decides to ask for copies, or does he return what is described as the reproduced entry? This may sound a bit far-fetched, but according to what was said during the Committee stage in another place there is this ambiguity. The noble Lord, Lord Colville of Culross, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the registers are to be taken in from district registrars and kept permanently in the General Registrar Office, … it will be important that the copies which go back to the district registries shall be available to the public."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>House of Lords,</i> 25th February, 1965; Vol. 263. c. 1009.]</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord, Lord Hughes, did not make clear whether it was copies or the original which was coming back. This is a point on which I ask the hon. Lady if she would dwell for a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another point also on this Clause on which I wish to dwell. I was asked a question yesterday about district examiners. There are five district examiners employed by the Registrar General. Their statutory function is to examine the register completed each year by registrars and to correct any errors and to transmit the register to the Registrar General. All this is covered in in this Clause and later in Clause 42. In addition the district examiners have other duties given to them by the Registrar General. These may include things like discussions with town and county clerks on problems of mutual interest and matters concerning the five-yearly censuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The country is divided into five areas, the northern, the eastern, the western, the midlands and the southern. Every registrar is visited once every year. Additional visits are made only when necessary, for example, on the appointment of a new registrar. There are a few exceptions where the registers themselves are very small and the districts are fairly inaccessible. For instance Fair Isle and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
the Island of Foula are visited only once every five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the keeping of the registers and the transmitting of the registration under the Acts, all registers of births, deaths and marriages are kept in duplicate. Entries are made both in the appropriate register and in a duplicate. If the event is a birth or death both entries are signed by an inspector. At the end of the calendar year the registers and the duplicate registers are closed. This is when the district examiner goes to inspect and the register is transmitted to the Registrar General. It is the duplicate which is retained by the registrar. So there is both a local and a central one in which search can be made and from which extracts can be issued, but the basic, main original is with the Registrar General. These are the registers which will be preserved in New Register House and it is these which will be kept by a xerographic process for the registrar. That explains the position. All this transmitting and copying and all the rest of it is to make sure that a local register is kept which can be searched, but the basic original one, the proper register, goes to the Registrar General at the end of each year so that it can be collected in the whole area covering the whole of Scotland for every year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is concerned with adoption. Under Section 22(3) the Adoption Act, 1958, the Registrar General may issue an extract of an entry in the adopted children register, but that Section does not empower the issue of abbreviated certificates. In order to meet demands from adoptive parents who want a certificate which bears no reference to the fact that the child has been adopted the Registrar General has for some years issued a certificate in abbreviated form which excludes any reference to adoption. It is hoped that the reason for issuing an abbreviated certificate in relation to adopted children will be appreciated by the Committee. It is provided for by the new subsection in Amendment No. 63 which we are discussing with this one. This Amendment is a drafting Amendment which is made necessary by the proposed introduction of the new provision, and Amendment No. 62 is designed to eliminate references to adoption which were inserted originally when it was thought that the Clause as it stood would cover abbreviated certificates in respect of adopted children. There are, of course, no particulars relating to adoption in the ordinary birth certificate. This should ensure that in future the only difference between an abbreviated certificate of an adopted child and that of an ordinary child will be in respect of the place of birth, which, in the case of the adopted child, will be the country rather than the town. This is a very great advance for adopted children and their parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Let us suppose that John Smith for some reason is then adopted and renamed William Brown. The adoptive parents know nothing, probably, of his real parents. Does a copy of the court order go to the Registrar General who then enters the particulars in his adopted children register? What then happens to the original record with John Smith on it?

This is a very happy drafting Amendment, because what we find we can do is to leave out a whole subsection. We find it superfluous because subsections (3), (4) and (5) give registrars and district examiners certain powers in regard to
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
corrections, and subsection (6) covers all other errors, whether they be clerical errors or errors of fact. I am very happy to move an Amendment which will reduce the size of the Bill by one subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"such type of error as he may specify".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this Amendment is to allow the Registrar General to authorise district examiners to correct errors which they find in the registers and which might not always fit the description of "clerical error". Entries in the register have to conform to certain patterns, and, as the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) will know from his study of his documents, instructions and examples are supplied to registrars from time to time how this should be done. Nevertheless, there are quite often errors in the form or pattern of entries. An error in form would be, for example, where there appeared in a marriage entry the name of somebody who was Mary Smith, formerly MacPhail, formerly MacPherson. If the previous names were put in the wrong order it would be an error in form. An error in pattern would be where it was put in the wrong column. This will ensure that district examiners can put this kind of thing right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is highly sensible that the registrar is given a lot of latitude and that the Registrar General stands ready to deal with the more important errors, while in the background for errors with which the Registrar General feels he cannot deal, there is the sheriff available for appeal if necessary.

This Amendment is desirable in order to make it quite clear that nothing in the Clause will prejudice the powers, under Section 24 of the Adoption Act, 1958, of a court, by which an adoption order has been made, to order the insertion of a different name in the adopted children's register.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two points on which I would like to comment. As I understand subsection (3) if a Christian name is changed within a year of the birth of the child the Registrar General can record the change provided he gets the necessary form or certificate before the child is two years old, but under subsection (4) the surname or Christian name can be changed and rerecorded provided the child is not 16 and provided also that the Registrar General is satisfied on one of two points, either that the new names have been in use for two years, or that he has seen a notice which has been placed in a local newspaper expressing the intention to change the names. I take it the reason for the advertisement in a local newspaper, which at first sight seems slightly ponderous, is to safeguard against some kind of improper action. Subsection (5) deals with the situation of a person over 16 who wants to change and re-record his name. The Christian name can be changed once but the surname three times. Five years has to pass between each change of surname, although the Registrar General is permitted to waive these restrictions if he so wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Second Reading my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) raised a point in connection with the criminal community and their ability to change their names. Would the hon. Lady be so good as to reply to that point, as she did not do so then? May I also ask what the effect of this ability to change surnames will have on the issuing of passports? Would it be possible for one person to hold three passports?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) contains rather strange words for a Scottish Bill. It says that a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
person can apply to have "the English equivalent of a non-English name" recorded as an alternative one. What precisely, is meant by "non-English name"? Does it cover those names which I would not attempt to pronounce although I know the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) can easily roll them off his tongue? That is to say, Gaelic names.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am rather interested in why there is no provision for the reverse process. What about the person who has an English name but who turns into a passionate Scottish Nationalist and wishes to re-record his name in some Scottish form? I have no sympathy for the Scottish Nationalist, and I have always been a Jacobite at heart, and I have always strongly supported the use of Gladsmuir for Prestonpans and Drumossie Muir instead of Culloden. The situation may arise of a person wishing to take a Gaelic equivalent to his English name and I do not see why this should not be permitted. It would only affect a minority, but I hope the hon. Lady will give it earnest consideration, because we should not despise minorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we know that the hon. Gentleman is a Jacobite at heart, and we will remember that. He is right that subsection (7) deals with Gaelic names. However, I would have thought that a staunch Scottish Nationalist would want to abandon his former name altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) relates to alternative names—someone having two names at the same time. This is to cover the bilingual areas such as the Western Isles where parents have been faced with the question of whether to register the Gaelic name by which their child will be known at home or at school, or the English equivalent, which he may find more convenient when he grows up and wishes to move elsewhere. We see no reason why such a desperate choice should be imposed on parents. This subsection is to enable children in the Gaelic speaking areas to have two names where the rest of us have only one. It will be possible for English equivalents to be added to Gaelic names in existing entries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection could also be used, although this was not the primary pur-
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
pose, to deal with applications for English alternatives to other non-English names provided the birth was registered in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have written to the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) rather fully on the point he made. We looked very closely at the point he raised on the procedure for recording a change of name or surname, because of the risk of people obtaining more than one passport, or posing as two or more separate persons. In my letter I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should make it clear that there is no power in the Bill to obtain an extract from the Register of Corrections Etc., in which the changes will be recorded. Clauses 37 and 38 restrict extracts to the Registers of Births, Deaths, Marriages and Still-Births, and Clause 40 restricts abbreviated certificates to the Register of Births. When an application for a change of name or surname is accepted by the Registrar General he will have the change recorded in the Register of Corrections Etc. under Clause 43. The original entry in the Register of Births will remain unaltered except for the addition of a reference to the insertion in the Register of Corrections Etc."</p></blockquote>
No one except an adopted person, or whose birth was reregistered, will have a certificate which does not show his name and surname as first registered. Therefore when someone changes his name or surname several times and where the changes are recorded the extract will have the other name at the top. However clever the person may be he will not be able to get over this, and we shall be safe from people getting two passports, or posing as more than one person, or of misrepresentation, with which the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) have rightly shown themselves concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment is necessary because the wording as it stands, I freely confess, is ambiguous. What is intended is that it will be an offence for anyone to get an authenticated extract or certificate and then have it reproduced by photography or xerography, the reproduction being passed as genuine. The paragraph could be read as meaning that it is an offence to pass a reproduction of an unauthenticated extract, thereby implying that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
is no offence to pass a reproduction of an authenticated one. We think if we make this Amendment we shall remove the ambiguity and make the matter perfectly clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I take this opportunity of apologising for my air of some surprise just now in finding myself not required to move an Amendment to leave out a Clause? That Amendment, No. 84, was looking forward to the point we are covering here. Amendment No. 84, was to leave out that Clause in order that this new Clause might be put in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that we want to clear the way for looking after the registers extremely carefully. The new Clause is really self-explanatory. It makes sure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
that where registers are originals, and where some of them are in rather an antique state, they are carefully looked after. In some of them the handwriting has faded and the pages are a little frayed, and, naturally, we would like to be sure that a search is made by a member of the Registrar General's staff. This must be so, of course, in all cases where the application is made by post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This kind of staff search was not covered by the former Clause. Even under the very good storage conditions in the Registrar General's office it is a sad fact that some deterioration is bound to continue, because it is a matter of time. Indeed the time may come when the Registrar General will have to decide that some of these historic registers must be kept only for trained members of the staff to search, or for use by searchers who are known to be reliable. Happily, we have not yet reached that stage, but this new Clause makes sure that we can protect these old registers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely and absolutely endorse the wisdom behind this, because some of these records are indeed very precious to the whole history of the country. It would be a disaster if anybody could go in and search through any document, as I rather think anybody would have been entitled to do under the wording of the original Clause. Therefore, I am completely at one with the hon. Lady in endorsing this new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a contrary question I have this time. I have an impression that the wording of this new Clause is not too clear. It may be that the growing years are dimming my knowledge of the English language, but on reading this I get the impression that the fees have to be paid by the Registrar General:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On payment of such fee or fees as may be prescribed, the Registrar General shall"—</p></blockquote>
and so on. To me, as a layman, that rather reads as though it is the Registrar General who pays the fees, whereas of course it is the applicant who would have to pay the fee. I wonder whether my hon. Friend would confirm that that is the intention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention is certainly not that the Registrar General should pay

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this case we are considering an Opposition new Clause which is the one concerning the status of a person which has been altered by a decree of the court being noted in the register.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Lady for taking up the suggestion contained in our new Clause, because if, for example, the marriage section of the register is to be a valid and useful document it ought to record any change in the status of the persons concerned, as for example by a decree of divorce. On this side of the Committee we are perfectly happy to accept the hon. Lady's terminology in her new Clause. I would merely say in defence of our new Clause that it is a repeat, as the hon. Lady is no doubt well aware, of Section 5 of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act, 1855.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make one small point on the wording of the Government's new Clause. The hon. Lady has inserted a provision with regard to appeals. The Clause reads that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the clerk of court shall, where no appeal has been made against such decree, on the expiration of the time within which such an appeal may be made, or where an appeal has been made against such a decree, on the conclusion of any appellate proceedings, notify the import of such decree …"</p></blockquote>
It does not as a matter of detail cover the situation where an appeal has been withdrawn. I remember coming across this when we were considering the Highland hill farming compulsory purchase orders; there were cases where appeals had been made and not withdrawn. I think after the words "against such a decree" it might be better to insert the words "and not withdrawn". Otherwise there will be a hiatus in the provision. If we are to specify in detail what might happen in the case of an appeal, then we may as well be complete and consistent and deal with what happens when an appeal is made and not withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. and learned Gentleman rightly says, this is based on Section 5 of the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act, 1855. I am happy to confirm that. The position under that Act, and under the Registration Act of 1860, provides that additions and alterations directed and authorised by the Registration Acts should be inserted in the Register of Corrected Entries instead of being made in the manner set out in the relative sections. That is still the position today and this new Clause is designed to continue the practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
The question of an appeal being withdrawn was raised, but I understand that the appellate proceedings are concluded in that case and they are therefore covered. I am sure this is properly covered in the new Clause as we have drafted it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It might be for the convenience of the Committee to consider our following new Clause at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>(Registration of irregular marriages)</i></p>

	<p>Where a decree of declarator establishing an irregular marriage has been granted by the Court of Session, the Principal Clerk of Session shall forthwith cause the decree and the names, designations and addresses of the parties to be intimated to the Registrar General and on receipt of such intimation the Registrar General shall cause the marriage to be registered.</p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: So be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of these two new Clauses is to introduce a practice in Scotland whereby we have one system of registration for all marriages. This Bill deals, of course, with the registration of marriages celebrated by a priest or other minister of religion—in other words, celebrated in church. There are provisions, as hon. Members will know, in the Marriage (Scotland) Act, 1939, for the celebration of a marriage before a registrar—what is loosely called a civil marriage—and the first of these two new Clauses embodies the suggestion that those marriages should be recorded in the same way as marriages in a church. The wording of the new Clause is taken from Section 1(2) of the Marriage (Scotland) Act, 1939, which makes provisions for the recording of these marriages. In other words, the new Clause suggests that where we are dealing with civil marriages
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0858">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
the system of registration should be the same, and that there should be one general register both for marriages celebrated in church and marriages entered into before a registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other new Clause goes one step further and suggests that Common Law marriages should likewise be registered under the one system of registration. As hon. Members are no doubt aware, by the Common Law of Scotland it has always been possible, until limited by Statute, to enter into a valid marriage other than by ceremony in church or before a registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Common Law had three forms of irregular marriage. One was by declaration 
	<i>de presenti,</i> by which two parties with no necessity for anyone to be present to make it binding, could take each other as man and wife, and the law recognised they were man and wife. The difficulty which would arise in that case would be establishing proof of this interchange of consent, and by tradition, before the 1939 Act, this was one way in which people from the south of the Border came to take advantage of what was, by the Common Law of Scotland, a way of becoming married.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second form of Common Law marriage was promise—an undertaking by a woman that she would marry, sexual relations taking place on the faith of that undertaking—marriage 
	<i>subsequente copula.</i> Both these forms were abolished by Section 5 of the 1939 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There still remains a third form of irregular marriage, by cohabitation and repute, whereby two people live together for a period of time, the time factor being a question of fact which the court would have to pronounce on in individual cases. At some point in time they become married persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to suggest to the hon. Lady that we have got to the time when that relic of the Common Law should be removed from the law of Scotland. It is not satisfactory, it seems to me, that a marriage should be constituted in this way in this day and age, and I hope the day is not far distant when we shall have the advantage of a matrimonial proceedings Act which can deal with
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
this and other laws of marriage. This is not the place in which to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest in this new Clause that marriages instituted by the declarator of the court likewise should find their way on to the register. In that way the register in Scotland will embody a record of all marriages which have taken place in Scotland, whether in church, before a registrar, or by operation of the Common Law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well appreciate the purpose of the new Clause we are considering but I am afraid I see a great many difficulties if it were to be accepted. At an early stage in the preparation of this Bill it was decided that provisions in the Marriage Act, 1939, relating to the registration of civil marriages could not easily be imported into the Bill because registration is an essential step in the civil marriage procedure as defined in the Marriage Act and removal of the registration provision would create many difficulties. It was then considered whether the whole of the 1939 Act could be incorporated in the Registration Bill. This would have been nice and neat and tidy, but this idea had to be abandoned because we reached the conclusion that what is needed in due course is a restatement of the marriage code covering the whole field. If and when legislation of that kind is proposed the marriage provisions of the Bill could be revoked and re-enacted in the new marriage Bill. In that way all the provisions relating to ecclesiastical, civil and irregular marriages, including their registration, would be brought into one Act. At present we see no real advantage in bringing the provisions of this new Clause into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be practicable to import into the Bill the provision in the Marriage Act relating to the registration of irregular marriages, that is Section 6(1), but the new Clause seeking to do that should properly contain the revocation of the provision in the 1939 Act. This would be an untidy arrangement unless it were possible to do a similar thing in respect of the provision which relates to the registration of civil marriages, and this is not possible. With Section 1(4) of the 1939 Act, registration of a civil
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
marriage is valid if the marriage is contracted in accordance with the "foregoing provisions" and one of these provisions is the one relating to registration. It is a complicated matter, and the one thing that could be done that would be nice and tidy is, we think, impracticable, and one wants to look at this on a broader scale. The thing that would perhaps be possible, in terms of taking something out of the Marriage Act, in fact we find involves great difficulties. To remove the provision relating to registration by itself might, in fact, change the law, and we have no mandate under this Bill for such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While appreciating the desire of hon. Members opposite to try and tidy up an even bigger piece of the legislative field than we are attempting to do by this Bill I would ask, would they not agree that we should tidy up the whole of the law relating to marriage, and treat this as a separate thing in a new marriage Bill, which could include the registration bit of this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was well aware that these suggestions in the two new Clauses would not be easy to effect, and there were consequential provisions with which these do not deal. There would have to be a repeal of part of the Marriage Act 1939. However, I am grateful to the hon. Lady for having thought about this matter in the way she obviously has done. I take it from what she has said that she accepts that it would be desirable to try to incorporate into one system of registration the record of all marriages entered into. If she feels, as I think she does, that the whole matter would be better dealt with by separate legislation, with consequential amendments to this Bill when it becomes law, I am certainly prepared to accept that. I hope the Government may find time at an early stage to deal with this problem. I appreciate that the hon. Lady cannot give any assurance on this matter, but, as this is a matter on which minds are being turned, perhaps before very long we may get a matrimonial provisions Bill for consideration.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages Act, 1860, I noticed, when I was going through the Acts which are to be repealed, a provision in that Act of 1860, which, it seems to me, might be worth retaining, because it has some bearing, rather remotely, on the concern which was expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) about people who are domiciled or ordinarily resident in Scotland having children in England and having them registered in Scotland. The 1860 Act provides, in effect, that, if a birth takes place in a foreign country, after certain procedure within 12 months, that birth can be registered in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 10 of the 1860 Act provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the birth of any child of Scottish parents, or the death or marriage of any Scottish subject, which shall take place in any foreign country, if intimated to the Registrar General within twelve months after the date thereof … and duly certified by the British consul of the country or district within which such birth, death, or marriage shall have taken place, shall be entered in a book to be kept for the purpose in the General Registry Office, to be called 'The Foreign Register'; and all such intimations shall be filed, and the relative entries verified by the signature of the Registrar General."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
I am not suggesting that simply by accepting Section 10 of that Act it is going to be enough to retain those provisions. It may not be; there are certain procedures to be followed, and it may be that certain other provisions and other Statutes might have to be retained. It does seem to me, however, that the circumstances envisaged by Section 10 of the 1860 Act are such that it might be usefully retained. They do not, of course, apply to England, and one cannot help my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries on this matter, but it applies to births, deaths or marriages of persons of Scottish domicile abroad in foreign countries, and one would not like to see a provision of that nature go by the board unless there were some good reason for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has given a very good explanation of what the Foreign Register used to do. In fact, because of spine of the new arrangements which have come into being, very little use has been made of the Foreign Register in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1914 copies of entries in registers kept by British consuls in respect of births and deaths of people of Scottish origin have been sent to the Registrar General in Scotland, and similar arrangements in relation to marriages at which the consuls were present have applied since 1917. Since 1947 it has been possible to record in the same manner particulars of marriages conducted in foreign countries without the presence of the consul. Between 1861 and 1914 the Foreign Register provided the only means of registration for these events occurring in foreign countries affecting Scots. Since 1914 there has steadily been growing up other means of doing this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that hardly any use has been made of the Foreign Register recently. Since 1945 only 64 births, 11 deaths and 140 marriages have been registered. If these events took place now all could be registered under the arrangements which we have referred to. In fact, many were so registered in that way, by means of the consul writing to the Registrar General.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Foreign Register did serve a useful purpose, but that usefulness has now disappeared. I do not in any way mean to make any sort of political point, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
in fact the letter from the Foreign Office in 1961 to the Registrar General which raised this whole question expressed the view that the Foreign Register should be discontinued because it was likely to cause confusion, and at that time the Foreign Secretary was the present Leader of the Opposition. For some time it has been the view of the Foreign Office that there was difficulty in the confusion that this could cause, and since the Register was less used, we thought that it should be discontinued. The confusion lies in the fact that the retention of the Foreign Register could mean that people might assume that the registration in a foreign register carried with it the right of nationality and in fact it does not. As provision is made for Scottish people living abroad to have everything happening to them recorded, we say that this is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that the new arrangements, which have been used for a number of years, and for which provision is made in the Bill, are better than relying on something which was useful at one time but which has now been less used for many years and was likely to cause confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, on behalf of the whole Committee, thank you, Mr. Lever, for performing what has been an extremely arduous Chairman's job, conducted at times when I know that you have not had a great deal of sleep and had already been engaging your intellect on other matters in another place for a considerable time. The Chairman's job in this Committee has been extremely demanding, although perhaps we have eased it a little for you by being a fairly cordial Committee. But we do express our gratitude to you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of my hon. Friends, I should like to endorse what the hon. Lady has said. I found it fascinating to speculate on your immediate reaction, Mr. Lever, when you were drafted to the Chairmanship of the Scottish Standing Committee. I congratulate you on having presided over the making of history—as I think: because I do not recollect any previous occasion on which the Scottish Standing Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
mittee has dealt with nearly 60 Clauses in the course of two Sittings. For this we have greatly to thank you, and I hope that it will prove a pattern for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the sole representative of the Liberal Party present, I wish to associate myself with what has been said by the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman, and particularly with the reference by the hon. Lady to what has taken place in the Chamber. 1 have there watched and listened with great appreciation to you, Mr. Lever, as I think we all did, although I cannot claim to have followed it all. The business of this Committee has been dealt with in an excellent and expeditious way, which is what is wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In thanking you, I can only say that it has been a great privilege to have this first opportunity of presiding over the Scottish Standing Committee, when I have been brought into what has been a rather too brief contact with the traditionally high intelligence and analytical skill of the Scottish people. I hope I shall have the privilege again, on a slightly more controversial Measure. It will be even more enjoyable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
