	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dr. John Gilbert)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it will be convenient to the Committee if we discuss this order with those relating to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, the Seychelles, and air transport undertakings and their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know for how long the Committee would like me to expound on the merit of these orders. I am delighted to see the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) in his place. We parted company only a few short hours ago and only a couple of rooms away. I am certainly at the disposal of the Committee to attempt to answer any questions, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will acquit me of discourtesy if I do not go into a long preliminary exposition. If Ile would prefer that I said a few words later I shall be happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has mentioned it will be for the convenience of the Committee if the four orders are considered together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Financial Secretary has just said we were both on our feet at about five o'clock this morning, just a couple of rooms along the corridor. It is perhaps a commentary on the difficulty of improving our proceedings that I think either of us would have happily debated this matter on the Floor of the House at Ten o'clock last night rather than this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At all events, I have no particular points to raise on the first three of these orders. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will confirm that there is nothing unusual about them. Over the years, we have had many orders of this kind and it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
only when something is exceptional that one would wish to have one's attention drawn to it. That is something about which the Financial Secretary would be advised, whereas we would have some difficulty in perceiving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Double Taxation Relief (Air Transport Undertakings and their Employees) (Soviet Union) Order 1974, I am surprised to see its form, and I wonder whether the Financial Secretary could tell us what other double taxation relief orders exist relating to particular categories of commercial undertaking or individuals in a particular country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My recollection is that the normal procedure is to give relief to the country effectively but not to particular groups within the country, which seems an unusual procedure. Will the Financial Secretary tell us whether this is unique, and whether we have ever been asked to approve an order of this kind before? If not, I think it is something which the Committee, or possibly the House, might wish to consider at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 2 relates to chargeable gains on profits, income and capital gains. Should not that also cover development gains in the present context? It may be that the order was approved, or formulated, before we actually had a development gain, but if one is to give coverage to it at all one should consider whether that is also a tax which ought to be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the question of symmetry, or asymmetry, in fiscal legislation. I am not clear to what extent on a reciprocal basis—therefore, a symmetrical basis—it is the case that nationals of our own country are presumably necessarily concerned with air transport undertakings and the employees in them. That is presumably so with British airlines. I am not clear to what extent they would be subject to charges on profits, income or capital gains in the Soviet Union. Is this a reciprocal arrangement—or what the Financial Secretary, in his favourite term, would describe as lopsided or asymmetrical—so that we are giving relief to those employed by air transport undertakings and to the air transport undertakings themselves in this country, whereas there is no reciprocal benefit to our own operators or employees in the Soviet Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Gilbert</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting his observations in terms of such studious moderation, and I congratulate him on having done his homework so well. I do not know whether he managed to do it between five o'clock and 10 o'clock this morning, but I congratulate him on retaining whatever he
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I am aware, there are no points of principle involved in the first three orders to which I need draw his attention. The hon. Gentleman's second question was whether or not there is a precedent for partial agreements. I am informed that there are several. I can list them for him, starting with one in 1949 with Argentina. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to have the reference, it is Statutory Instrument 1949 No. 1435 which covers shipping and air transport profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several others dealing either with shipping and air transport profits together, or with air transport profits separately. They relate to Greece 1951, Iran 1960, Portugal 1962, Lebanon 1964, Brazil 1968 and Spain 1969. Two of those agreements, the ones with Greece and Portugal, were subsequently replaced by comprehensive agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third question was about whether or not development gains should have been specifically named in Article 2(
	<i>a</i>) of the order in respect of the Soviet Union. The order was drafted before the Finance Bill. I am advised that the charge to income tax will probably catch that. In any case, it is unlikely to arise in real life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question whether we have symmetry, there is not just a desire to have symmetry; there is an element of reciprocity. I understand that employees of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
British airlines in Russia might be taxed on their salaries were it not for the agreements. I hope that my explanations meet the hon. Gentleman's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I take it that that does not arise in respect of capital gains?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Gilbert</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not arise, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
