	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Rural Affairs (Mr. Tim Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Potato Industry Development Council Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
I should like to preface my remarks by saying how pleasant it is once again to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton. I hope that we shall have an urbane debate on an important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order is presented in accordance with the requirements of the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947. Its purpose is to provide for the establishment of a potato industry development council to take forward some of the work of the Potato Marketing Board. The draft order was laid before the House on 13 January and approved by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on 22 January. A compliance cost assessment of the impact on the potato industry of the proposed levies was placed in the Library of the House on 13 January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by reminding the House of the background. The Agriculture Act 1993 gave Ministers power to revoke the potato marketing scheme, should they consider it necessary or in the public interest. Subsequently, a year ago, on 17 January, we debated the order which specified 1 July 1996 as the date 12 months from which the potato marketing scheme would be revoked. That means that the scheme will come to an end on 30 June this year, the end of the potato marketing year and, therefore, the most convenient transition date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As required under section 27(1) of the 1993 Act, the Potato Marketing Board has applied to agriculture Ministers for approval of a scheme to transfer its property, rights and liabilities to a successor body, the development council. That followed a growers' poll which showed overwhelming support for such a body—although, unsurprisingly, it was not unanimous—and for our own consultation with all sectors of the potato industry on a proposal to establish such a council. We consulted growers, merchants, packers, processors, retailers, consumers and representatives of employees in the industry, as is required by section 1 of the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I informed the House a year ago, all sectors of the industry had already agreed on the necessity of a levy-funded successor body to the board and had reached consensus on the form that such a body should take.
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
That agreement was confirmed by our recent consultation, but there was less consensus on the proposed funding arrangements. I shall go into detail on that point in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the draft order. The proposed functions for the council are listed in schedule 1, and can be summarised as: commissioning or assisting research and development; the collection and dissemination of statistical information; generic promotion and the development of exports; and setting basic quality standards for raw potatoes. In brief, those functions are research, statistics and marketing development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 sets out the constitution of the council. It will comprise 16 members, including the chairman and one other who must be independent of the potato industry. Nine members will represent the interests of growers, one will represent employees in the industry and the remaining four will represent the industry beyond the farm gate, including one with knowledge of the marketing or distribution of potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least one of the nine grower members must be a specialist seed producer and article 5 provides for the council, immediately after being set up, to establish a seed sectoral group. That group, which could also comprise non-members of the council, will advise the council on how to carry out its functions in respect of the seed potato sector. I should say that nothing precludes the council from setting up other committees, but the explicit provision for a seed sectoral group recognises the importance we attach to that sector of the industry, and in that sector, the views of Scottish growers in particular are reflected in the decision to support a GB-wide approach and, by implication, to wind up their separate seed producers council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new council will be required to keep a register in two parts—of producers who grow one hectare or more of potatoes and first purchasers of 100 tonnes or more of potatoes. The council will not have to start from scratch, but will benefit from taking over the Potato Marketing Board's current register of producers and records of formerly licensed merchants. The register will be open for inspection and copied may be taken or supplied for a reasonable fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 requires ministerial approval of any returns or other information that the council might require from registered persons. If growers or first purchasers fail to make annual returns, the order entitles the council to make an assessment. As I said earlier, our consultation revealed widespread support for setting up a council, but there were many diverse views on funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation paper that was circulated sought views on two methods of levy collection. One was an area contribution from growers of one hectare or more of potatoes, plus a tonnage area contribution at first point of sale from those purchasing 100 tonnes or more of potatoes per annum. The second option consisted of a single tonnage levy, made up of contributions from both the grower and first purchaser, and collected at the first point of sale. Although it was widely accepted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
that one point of collection would be the most cost-effective procedure and that the levy would, in fact, spread along the marketing chain by the normal operation of market forces, there was significant opposition to a single levy point from growers and processors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Growers believed that they would end up picking up the bill, regardless of the point at which a single levy was formally taken out. They also argued that a single levy proposal was a different concept from that evolved by the joint consultative committee of the Potato Marketing Board, which represents all sections of the industry and whose suggestions were agreed by growers when put to them by the board in a poll. They argued that a single levy point would undermine the concept—which, I remind the Committee, is entirely acceptable all round—of a body able to act for the industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are some practical difficulties associated with levy collection at first point of sale, but article 9 of the order sets out a way in which it might be implemented. We are grateful to the industry for the help that we have received in drawing up the framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order provides for a ceiling of £40 per hectare for the growers' levy and 25p per tonne at the first point of sale. I remind the Committee that those figures are somewhat reduced as a result of the consultation process. I emphasise that they are ceilings; the actual rates will be proposed by the council and be subject to the approval of Ministers. Some people in the industry thought that the figures shown in the order would be taken as targets rather than ceilings, but we have set them higher than the anticipated charges to save the need for early amending legislation to change the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charges will become due on 1 November each year for growers and, for first purchasers, quarterly in arrears with provision for adjustments to the end-September payment in the light of the purchasers' declared annual throughput. The order also makes provision for unpaid levies to be recovered as a debt, which may be subject to interest charges. There are also standard provisions enabling the council to borrow or invest money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, article 12 sets out offences and penalties. If people fail to register with the council, fail to make returns or produce records, they will be liable to a fine not exceeding level 3, which is £1,000 on the standard scale. There is also a continuing offence provision of £5 per day. Those who knowingly or recklessly provide false information shall be liable to a fine not exceeding level 5, which is £5,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will draw to an end the cycle that started with the passing of the Agriculture Act 1993. It will end some of the uncertainty that the industry has faced while it has adjusted to the free market. It facilitates an easy transition from the Potato Marketing Board under the scheme when it comes to an end to a new representative body to carry out important functions for the industry. With that in mind, I have pleasure in commending the draft order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sorry to see the end of the Potato Marketing Board, which did such a fine job for both producers and consumers in Britain until dismantled by the ideology of this Government, but we welcome its successor body, the potato industry development council, which is created by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time we discussed potatoes, I had to take the Government to task for their lackadaisical attitude, their lack of effort and their incompetence. There does not seem to have been any improvement by the Department since that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potato industry has reasonable grounds for complaint against the Department, first, because it has taken so long to produce this order providing for a potato industry development council and, secondly, because the Government have still not secured action by the European Commission that would prevent other countries from subsidising their potato industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delay in producing the order has been especially frustrating because, as the Minister has acknowledged, those in the industry have wanted the potato industry development council to run alongside the Potato Marketing Board for a number of months. The delays are inexcusable. We were told by the Minister that the order would be laid in 1996, but it did not arrive. What are the reasons for the delay? On 20 December, the Minister kindly wrote to say that it had not been possible to achieve the objective of laying the order before the end of the year. In explanation, he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The order is a complex document and we have had to have more extensive discussions with industry on the detailed arrangements in respect of the first point of sale levy on potatoes than was originally anticipated. We have sought to lay down arrangements which could be readily understood and implemented by the Council. Although this has caused some delay there would ultimately be practical benefit to the council."</p></blockquote>
I should like the Minister to amplify that statement and tell us what he specifically had in mind. Why was there such delay? A comparison between the draft order and that now before us does not seem to justify his claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Department wisely accepted the National Farmers Union's advice to change the definition of "first point of sale", so that it would not require the handling agent to take physical delivery. The Department did that simply by adding to the list of definitions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'take delivery' means to take into a person's possession or control, including where he does not take physical possession."</p></blockquote>
That surely was straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Department, by setting a lower limit of 100 tonnes, went some way to meet requests that the definition of "first purchaser" should either be left to the Council or should exclude those producing fewer than 200 tonnes. This does not seem, either, to have needed intensive negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, a change was made, again very sensibly, that the quantity of potatoes which a person shall be treated as selling shall be not the quantity after processing, as in the draft, but the quantity after the soil and stones have been removed. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
cannot say that there had to be weeks of negotiation to agree that point. I may have missed something and if so, perhaps the Minister would enlighten me. I incline to the view that there was delay because the order was badly drafted before going out to consultation. For example, to the definition of "commission agent" there was added the note:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This would be the correct definition in some industries. Is this how it works in the potato industry? Comments, please, from the people involved in the industry."</p></blockquote>
The National Farmers Union did correct the drafting, but would it not have been better for someone to make a phone call to sort out the order before sending it out? It does not inspire confidence to find attached to the provision for a committee, known as the seed sectoral group, a note from the draftsperson casting doubt on its legality and saying that further legal opinions would be considered. As, presumably, the present wording in section 5 is legal, why could it not have been included in the draft order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are drafting errors, and I now turn to an apparent omission for which I am sure there is a good reason. What precisely will happen to the assets of the Potato Marketing Board, which 65 per cent. of the potato growers voted to be transferred to the successor body rather than be shared out? What guarantee is there if they are put into a reserve fund of the new body that, in the event of the development council being wound up, the money would revert to the growers and not be gobbled up by the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand that the Potato Marketing Board has submitted a scheme for the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the development council, I should be interested to have the Minister's view of the two new subsections that the NFU suggested should be added to the order. The first of those stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Council shall establish and may thereafter maintain a Growers' Reserve Fund for the purpose of holding the residual funds of the Potato Marketing Board for the purposes of the council's functions,"</p></blockquote>
The second stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any moneys for the time being comprised in the Growers' Reserve Fund maintained under this article shall be invested for the benefit of the fund in accordance with Section 6."</p></blockquote>
I should also be most interested in the Minister's views on what the National Farmers Union said during the consultations about the effectiveness of the procedure for obtaining accurate records. The NFU stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no penalty incurred by the producers for not furnishing the Council with an accurate return. Indeed, there is encouragement as it stands for certain producers to increase hectarage and allow the council to assume a return based upon the previous year. Whilst acknowledging certain limitations in amending the section of the draft order, the NFU would ask MAFF to consider possible amendments so as to encourage producers to submit returns for the relevant deadlines."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the enabling legislation was restrictive in this case. I understand that the NFU proposed that interest of 4 per cent. over bank rate be added to overdue levies, whereas the order provides for 1 per cent. Could the Minister tell us why he is not harder on non-payers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
What about appointments to the board? In a letter to me the Minister said that they were going ahead with the appointment of a chairman and so on, subject to subsequent parliamentary approval of the order. That, of course, was a sensible move, which we could all fully support. Can we be assured that when all the Nolan procedures have been gone through, a chairman will be appointed by March?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is being done to ensure that growers are thrown the lifebelt of a lightweight EU potatoes regime? I am afraid that the answer may well be, "Not a lot."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, it will be a great disappointment to many people who, although opposing the abolition of the Potato Marketing Board, believed the Government when they persuaded people that they would protect our growers from unfair, subsidised competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall yet again the fine words of the Secretary of State for the Environment when he destroyed the Potato Marketing Board. He said that he wanted to get rid of support in other countries for their potato organisations. Did he mean that no sensible Government would stand aside and say, "Let the Dutch take it over. Let the French subsidise their industry into defeating ours"? I agree with that, but I doubt that it was the message that the right hon. Gentleman was trying to get across. I think that he was implying that the Government would secure the end of unfair competition and, clearly, they have not done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is Labour's wish that if the problem is not soon solved serious consideration should be given to securing agreement on a lightweight European potato regime when Britain has the presidency again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did listen carefully to what the hon. Lady said; she said that it would be the wish of her party to seek the undertaking. I am sure that she does not go nearly as far as the producers want; they want to know whether she will make a commitment to secure a lightweight potato regime. The answer to that is either yes or no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister is well aware of the industry's concern that there should be a level playing field in terms of potatoes traded within the European Union. He will share our concerns that other European Union countries may yet institute trade-distorting national aids, which would cut across the spirit of what we are discussing this morning and undermine all that the industry seeks to achieve through supporting the establishment of the potato industry development council. What reassurance can my hon. Friend give the Committee that a lightweight potato regime will be introduced during the British presidency of the European Union in 1988? What prospect is there that other countries will support such a proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to make a long speech and I shall not entertain the Committee with that possibility. I merely want to suggest that, regrettably, the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding) is being less than forthright in her assertion—if indeed it was an assertion. She talked of the Labour party's wish—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Alan W. Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. We are not here to discuss Labour party policy and what we may or may not do when we are in government in a few months' time. We are here to discuss this statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tredinnick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme speaks for the Labour party and the policy that she enunciated this morning is an important aspect of our deliberations. Were the country to be so unfortunate as to suffer a change of Government in a few months, the hon. Lady's wish might become an intention, that intention might become a reality and that reality might cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
pounds. This morning, the hon. Lady has tried to slip past this Committee—with few hon. Members present—yet another policy commitment, in this case relating to the Potato Marketing Board. That commitment could cost the taxpayer a large amount of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to get dragged into too many party political issues, but we have heard another addition to the wish list—perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister can help us, as I am sure that he is concerned about the matter. It behoves us to establish whether yet another enormous commitment has been made. What will the farmers in my constituency think about it? Is it just pie in the sky, or will the wish be turned into a very expensive commitment? What does my hon. Friend the Minister think about that new commitment, which has been slipped into the Committee's proceedings without a full debate? What is his view of that diabolical situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.55 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the contributions made by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme and my hon. Friends the Members for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) and for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick) in what has been broadly a consensus debate. Perhaps that is because the views of new Labour tend to coincide with those of the Government in this specific case. I should say briefly that dealing with the new Labour party is rather like moving through shallow waters where there is always the danger of coming across some hidden rocks—old Labour rocks that protrude from time to time and which might sink the ship. With the greatest respect, I must tell the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme that I do not share her anticipation of the results of the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pass on peacefully from that to dissent from her belief that the Potato Marketing Board has been dismantled by ideology. As she said, it did a fine job, but its time had come and gone. We needed a new and more flexible structure for a more competitive set of market conditions, including the very much larger share of the market now won by the potato processing industry in competition with international competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would help the Committee if I dealt first with that international point. The hon. Lady tried hard to draw a distinction between the parties in their commitment to a lightweight potato regime. We have advocated such a regime and have been in the perhaps not unique, but unusual position of being at one with the Commission in advocating it and we shall continue to do so. The plain fact, which was confirmed in our debate with the Council just before Christmas, is that the proposal does not command the support of a majority of member states. There has been relatively little movement in the previously polarised positions of those who do not want any of it at all and those who want a full-blown regime with intervention arrangements, which would be even less congenial to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
We shall continue our support for a lightweight regime, which would provide an opportunity of rehearsing the states' aid issue effectively. In addition, we shall take up with the Commission any examples of illegal state aid when there is evidence of it. If the hon. Lady had reread the debate on the winding up of the scheme last year, she would know that I specifically invited hon. Members at the time to send me evidence of distortions and damage being caused to our interests in the United Kingdom by unfair competition. I have received none as yet, but were Ito receive any, I should certainly consider them. When the opportunity arises—I hope to participate in the discussions with the Council during the British presidency—we shall continue to consider the issue and to press the case for a lightweight regime, against a disappointing absence of consensus. That touches on the concerns of my hon. Friends. If they find evidence that things are not as they should be, we want to hear about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the more domestic parts of the scheme with which the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme was concerned. I firmly rebut the charge of delay. She will appreciate—it happens to be a personal interest of mine—that there have been huge differences in the past few years, amounting to something of a quiet revolution, through the greater emphasis on the legal process and the fine print in carrying out such procedures. If we were to make a mistake in our formulation of the order, even on some of the detailed points raised by the hon. Lady, that would considerably disable the scheme from the beginning—it might even discredit it. We have taken the view—it is a long way round, but a worthwhile way round—that we should consult in detail on all the major points. We have done that and the consultation has been helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady gave undue weight to the fact that we did not make a large number of changes to the draft circulated for consultation. That is precisely the point because we needed to establish the understanding of all the players that matters were in order and to make only appropriate minimal changes. We also needed to consult with the trade. We have done so—including those who were less than happy with the dual levy arrangements, especially in the fresh produce consortium which is a retail consortium area—to explain what has happened, to listen to their concerns and to undertake to continue to monitor the position. So I make no apology for any delay. It seems to me better to wait a month and get it right than to rush into it and get it wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless I have misconceived the point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme, she is mistaken—indeed, so was the original response from the industry—in believing that there are no enforcement provisions. The enforcement provisions of the 1947 Act are not especially strong, but growers
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
will be required to register and there will be penalties for failing to provide information, which the new council will pursue as it will be unfair to those who contribute to levies if freeloaders do not do so. That point is very much in our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the chairman, I confirm that the procedures are going ahead with all speed. Quite properly, the Nolan procedure provides for another filter to ensure that we appoint the right person. We want to appoint the right person of either gender—someone who is suitable to undertake this important job which will be financed by the industry, not by the Government. We aim to make that appointment in March, in good time for the return of a Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I remind the Committee, not on a partisan note, that as far as we can within the boundaries of legislation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister concludes, may I ask him what has happened to the assets of the Potato Marketing Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I am most sorry that I have not dealt with that point. The board has tabled a transfer scheme, on which consultations will take place. From the figures that I have seen, I am sure that there will be a net surplus of assets in the potato marketing scheme, which will be transferred to the new development council. There could be considerable difficulty in trying to earmark or ring-fence those assets in the way that has been suggested within the development council, which should be able to deploy its funds as flexibly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, in future, the development council were to be wound up, it would be the subject of further parliamentary procedures and we would have to decide what would then happen to the funds. However, there are provisions in the 1947 Act for that eventuality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, on this matter as on others, Ministers have gone as far as they can within the boundaries of legislation to meet the concerns of the industry. We want the new council to be successful and serve the industry. The order will give effect to a framework developed with the industry, through the Potato Marketing Board's joint consultative committee, during a considerable period. The prime principle is that in establishing the body, we shall have a council that represents the whole industry. All the players in the industry will be able to play their part in addressing the challenges that the free market will put before them. We believe that it is a first-rate industry and a credit to Britain. We want it to continue to be a success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
