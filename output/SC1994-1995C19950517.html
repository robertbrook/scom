	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. William Hague)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 5, line 42, leave out "unduly prejudice an employer" and insert " be reasonable".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>No. 93, in page 5, leave out lines 44 to 48.</p>

	<p>No. 94, in page 6, line 5, leave out "from public funds".</p>

	<p>No. 29, in page 6, line 6, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) Regulations may make provision, for the purposes of this section—

	<ol>

	<li>as to circumstances in which it is reasonable for an employer to make accommodation of a prescribed description;</li>

	<li>as to circumstances in which it is not reasonable for an employer to make accommodation of a prescribed description.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5B) Regulations made under subsection (5A) may, in particular, make provision by reference to the cost of making the accommodation concerned.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment essentially addresses the point that we have already discussed under amendment No. 18 and therefore you will be delighted to hear, Mr. Hogg, that I do not wish to labour that point this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained at our last sitting, the Government have no objection to placing on an employer an obligation to make reasonable accommodation for a disabled person— indeed, that is the very obligation that we will place on employers via the Disability Discrimination Bill. We object to the provision on the ground that it will relieve the employer of that obligation only if the accommodation would unduly prejudice the operation of the business. The Government remain of the view that the correct test is one of reasonableness, which is what amendment No. 28 seeks to establish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the factors that would decide the issue of reasonableness—obviously, people would need to know what was and what was not reasonable—we envisage making regulations under clause 4(5A), which amendment No. 29 would add. It is right to consider that issue fully in order to inform employers of what is and what is not expected of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(5B), which amendment No. 29 would also insert, specifies that, for the avoidance of doubt, one of the matters that the regulations would encompass would be the relevance of cost. Furthermore, so as not to squander the knowledge and expertise that are already to hand, we envisage consulting widely on such regulations
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
and taking account of existing material, for example that in the code of good practice, which is published by the employment service, and in the civil service code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 93 and 94 would amend clause 4(5). The former would delete clause 4(5)(b), a provision that would allow employers to take into account when assessing the impact of an accommodation the overall financial resources of the workplace. I raise the issue to elicit from the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East an explanation of what that provision is intended to achieve. I should be interested to hear, for example, what weight he thinks should be attached to the workplace budget as opposed to the overall resources of the employer in question, which in my view would be a more realistic and sensible way in which to think about the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 94 would delete the words "from public funds" from clause 4(5)(d)—the provision that would allow for the availability of grants from public funds to be taken into account. Again, the amendment is designed to elicit for members of the Committee the hon. Gentleman's intentions. Why should grants from public funds alone be taken into account, rather than those from all the funds that might be available to the employer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall effect of the amendments would be to remove a number of provisions which are unclear and difficult to interpret or which, as currently drafted, would impose unreasonable burdens on employers. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My objection to amendment Nos. 28 and 29, which are related, is that amendment No. 28 would replace the words "unduly prejudice an employer" with the word "reasonable". Amendment No. 29 expands upon what reasonableness might mean, taking the Minister's regulation road for this Bill. The Bill provides for the Disability Rights Commission, which will help to shape the operation of the Bill's principles. The Minister always wants to keep regulations in his own hands, and the amendments are an extension of that principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not it be better for rules and regulations to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and not made by a quango?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Disability Rights Commission will produce reports and codes of practice and will be under regular scrutiny by the House. That will allow more scrutiny by the House than would be the case with the Secretary of State's work. Opposition Members know from hosts of legislation that, once the House passes authority to the Government, we often have only limited avenues for checking their actions. The Government and the Opposition have different approaches to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 93, the Minister argued that the overall financial resources of a firm, not those of the workplace, would be more significant for the employer's responses. It is an unfortunate characteristic of business and industry that they often work on a workplace unit basis. If I were negotiating with employers in my plant to eliminate pollution, for example, they might argue that they operated the plant as a separate unit and that their overall consideration was its viability. It would be a problem for them to find moneys from overall financial resources if that detracted from the finances of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
workplace. I wish that the world were different and that we had greater control over businesses because, in this matter, I am a regulator. As it stands, the measure would fulfill our intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 94 deals with the availability of grants to defray the expense of any accommodation and seeks to delete the words "from public funds". Grants might come from sources other than public funds, and we should take that into account. The amendment is, therefore, acceptable, but the other three are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to have made a little progress— the hon. Gentleman has accepted one of the amendments. He is right to say that the Government and the Opposition have a different approach, and that has been reflected in these and many of the other amendments that we have considered. Under his approach, a commission would decide many matters and then set out codes of practice, which would be discussed in Parliament, but would not have legal force. That is one of my objections to that approach. The approach that I favour is more practical and allows more legal certainty. In that approach, regulations should determine matters such as the test of reasonableness. That is a fundamental difference of approach, not a difference about objectives. It is simply a difference about the most practical way to decide matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I continue to believe that my approach, which is followed in the Disability Discrimination Bill, is better. The hon. Gentleman stands by his approach here. We have had the debate before and there is no point in pressing my amendments to a vote all the time. I have made my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather disappointed with the hon. Gentleman's response to my questions about the workplace. He is right that many businesses are organised on the basis of workplace budgets; but is that necessarily a good reason to frame the law in that way? This part of the Bill implies that a small factory without enough resources in its immediate budget would not have to carry out functions that would otherwise be required of it—yet that small factory could be owned by ICI. Should we allow this escape clause? I am trying to improve the hon. Gentleman's Bill with this amendment. He may want to think again about this issue, but I shall not make a great song and dance of it today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am obviously pleased that the hon. Gentleman has accepted my amendment dealing with the issue of public funds. I hope that he will seriously consider the workplace requirements more fully. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 94, in page 6, line 5, leave out "from public funds".</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 6, line 6, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5C) Nothing in this section imposes any duty on an employer in relation to a disabled person if the employer does not know, and could not reasonably be expected to know that the disabled person concerned—

	<ol>

	<li>is, or may be, an applicant for the employment; or</li>

	<li>has a disability.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
We have touched on this subject before so I shall not detain the Committee much longer on clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill as drafted, an employer could be held to have discriminated against a disabled applicant for a job even though he or she did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that the person was disabled. I am referring in particular to the situation where the employer, being unaware of the applicant's disability, failed to make reasonable accommodation as required by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is simply not reasonable for an employer to be expected to make an accommodation for a difficulty arising from a disability unless he or she was, or should have been, aware of that disability, and the likelihood of it affecting the disabled person in that way. The Bill should not require that reasonable accommodations be made simply on the hypothetical basis that there might at some time in the future be a job application from a person with a disability. The obligation to make such accommodations is confined to the situation where it proves necessary to address the particular needs of a particular disabled person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment is designed to ensure that an employer is not penalised in circumstances where he or she is simply unaware of the relevant facts. For example, if a disabled person failed to attend for a job interview and was subsequently rejected, the employer would not be held to have acted unlawfully if there was no reason why he or she should have known at the time that the person was disabled in a way likely to have such an effect. That would be fairer. Although I do not wish to stray too far from the amendment under discussion, I would remind the Committee that under clause 5, the employer's freedom to seek information about the health or medical status of a job applicant would be severely limited. The amendment would improve the Bill's fairness and I look forward to hearing the hon. Gentleman's comments on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If someone was rejected at an interview and it was not known that that person was disabled, presumably that person has been rejected on the ground of his or her inappropriateness otherwise to perform the tasks concerned or because another interviewee was held to have the skills and abilities to undertake the job. The amendment seems peculiar because it appears to allow for employers to discriminate on the ground of disability if they did not know that the person concerned was disabled. That seems to be an odd attitude. The amendment appears restrictive and unnecessary, and I reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is not intended to be restrictive and I do not recognise it as such. It is intended to be fair. I have stressed throughout our discussions on the Government Bill as well as on this Bill that one of the key qualities of legislation on this subject must be that it is fair to other people. It must secure the rights of disabled people at the same time as being—and being seen to be— fair to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill potentially creates an unfair situation. Employers could be taken to industrial tribunals when they did not know, or could not reasonably have known, that a person was disabled. Such circumstances pose a great danger and would greatly detract from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
credibility of the law, should they become law. We have made this point before and discussed similar points during the debate on earlier amendments to clause 4, so I shall let the matter rest. I highlight it as one reason for the Government's unhappiness about the approach in parts of the Bill. We prefer our own legislation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Minister proposes to withdraw the amendment. The failure of the Bill's promoter to accept the amendment gives the lie to his claim that he is even-handed in his attitude to the different parties that will be affected by the Bill's provisions. How could it be right for an employer who did not know that someone was disabled to be affected? Any reasonable and fair person would say that that was simply unacceptable. How can it be right for an employer who is wholly ignorant of the circumstances and the condition of a person to be subjected to the Bill's provisions? In all equity, that cannot be right or reasonable. As I said, I am sorry that the Minister proposes to withdraw his unexceptionable amendment. I cannot understand how adding it to the Bill would in any way affect the rights of disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss new clause 3—
	<i>Circumstances in which discrimination in relation to employment is justified—</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) For the purposes of section 4, an employer is justified in discriminating against a disabled person only if—

	<ol>

	<li>in his opinion, one or more of the conditions mentioned in subsection (3) are satisfied; and</li>

	<li>it is reasonable, in all the circumstances of the case, for him to hold that opinion.</li></ol>

	<ol>

	<li>In subsection (3), 'employment' includes promotion, job training or any privilege of employment.</li>

	<li>The conditions are that—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the disabled person is unsuitable for the employment;</li>

	<li>the disabled person is less suitable for the employment than another person and that other person is given the employment;</li>

	<li>the nature of the disabled person's disability significantly impedes, or would significantly impede, the performance of any of his duties; or</li>

	<li>in the case of job training, the nature of the disabled person's disability would significantly reduce the value of the training (either to him or to the employer).</li></ol>

	<li>Regulations may make provision as to other circumstances in which, for the purposes of section 4, an employer is to be taken to be justified in discriminating against a disabled person.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have debated clause 4 quite a bit already. It interrelates with clause 2 and with clauses 5 to 11, and is of course the principal employment clause in the Bill, covering the relationship between an employer
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
and his actual or prospective employees. It makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a disabled person in the recruitment of new employees or against disabled existing employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reinforce what I said earlier, I ought perhaps to make it clear, although I hope that it goes without saying, that the Government support the broad intentions underlying clause 4 and have introduced similar provisions in our own Disability Discrimination Bill. There is a need for legislation to be introduced to protect disabled employees and job applicants from being unfairly discriminated against on the grounds of their disability, including in the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are a number of fundamental differences between the approach tiiat we have taken in our Bill and that of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. We touched on some of those differences in debating the specific amendments to clause 4, and, indeed, those to earlier clauses. By relying on the concept of "qualified disabled person" the Bill creates unnecessary confusion and complexity. With its provisions on "reasonable accommodation" it further muddies the waters and in some instances threatens to impose unreasonable burdens on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a function of the Bill's drafting but I do not think that it was the intention at the outset. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) helped to highlight that problem a few moments ago. Furthermore, the Bill fails to make proper allowance for the fact that there may be occasions when less favourable treatment is justified—although that notion is implicit in the Bill's concept of "qualified disabled person", in the sense that a disabled person has to be qualified to benefit from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government tackle that in a different way, not by having the concept of "qualified" but by setting out some situations in which less favourable treatment is justified. That approach is much more straightforward. It allows us to make it clear what those situations are, whereas the use of the term "qualified" leaves it up to a commission or, ultimately, the courts to decide how that term is to be interpreted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latter point is addressed in new clause 3. Given that the Government believe that the word "qualified" should be omitted from the Bill, new clause 3 in consequence would establish certain limited circumstances in which, contrary to the general position, less favourable treatment of a disabled person would be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated that proposition before and at some length in connection with previous amendments. We all recognise that irrespective of whether the individual is disabled, there may be circumstances where it is entirely appropriate to treat one individual less favourably than another—for example when that individual is simply less suitable to do the job. The Government accept that where matters under an employer's control place a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage because of the effects of the disability and it is reasonable for the employer to make an adjustment—or, in the words of the Bill, an "accommodation"—that he should do so. However, that is very different from saying that no matter what the effects of a person's disability, the employer will be allowed to take them into account only if they impinge upon the essential functions of the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
The Bill makes a mistake in that. Such a provision, if it came into force, would be seen to be unfair to employers and would therefore be less likely to work. Clause 4 as drafted, without qualification by new clause 3, would mean that it would never be possible for an employer to treat a disabled person less favourably on the ground that his or her performance was impeded—even after reasonable accommodation—in carrying out nonessential tasks. As long as a disabled person could do the essential duties, which could be quite narrow, he or she would be entitled to the same status as a non-disabled person who was able to perform the full range of tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would create much resentment and would not foster an environment in which disabled people were readily accepted in the workplace. That is the rationale for the new clause, which is one of several amendments we have moved on the concept of the qualified disabled person. It is the counterpart of what the Government wanted—to remove "qualified". Given that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has rejected that removal, he is not likely to accept the new clause. I think that I have correctly anticipated his arguments. However, it is important to make the Government's approach clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the hon. Gentleman speak on the issue of small firms? That has been a contentious issue in the debates on the Government Bill. How can small firms be expected to judge what is a reasonable accommodation in any one case, especially as most small firms are much less likely than large employers to have experience of employing disabled people. They are also unlikely to have personnel specialists or staff with expertise in disability issues. Will not it be particularly difficult for small employers, generally without expert knowledge, advice or experience, to know which of the range of selection tests is most likely to reflect the skills or aptitudes of a disabled person, as set out in clause 4(2)(h)? Can I also ask the hon. Gentleman about 4(2)(d), which we have not yet debated and which refers to people having an association with a disabled person? Very many people could be said to have such an association; it is very imprecise terminology. How are employers or disabled people expected to know who is and who is not covered by the Bill? It could open the Bill up to abuse because almost anyone who was rejected for a job could claim that it was because he or she had an association with a disabled person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my continuing anxieties about clause 4. We have highlighted some differences of approach while agreeing on the overall objective. I welcome comments by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accepts that the new clause makes sense only if the word "qualified" is deleted from the Bill, but the Committee has decided that that word should remain. So the new clause runs against the whole spirit of everything that has previously been done. It is rather like those people who said no to the Common Market and who continue saying no eternally, come what may, no matter what changes take place. The Bill has had various parts accepted and some odd changes have been made to it; and the Minister should act within that framework. It would have been appropriate to withdraw the new clause, rather than pursuing with it—although the Minister could obviously make his point in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
The Minister's approach to the Bill is entirely different from ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has another peculiarity in that it is similar to, or taken from, the Minister's own measure that is before another place. There is much concern about that issue. Even their lordships on the Government side may table amendments to that clause. I do not know how fully the Minister stands by it in his own legislation, and that is another reason why it is inappropriate to include it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised a problem about small firms. The important point about them is that they are not all strapped for cash. There is a distinction between viable and unviable firms, but that is not the same as the distinction between large and small firms. In some areas it will be easier for small firms to meet the requirements than for some larger firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill will change attitudes in society. Employers' responses to disabled people are changing and the appropriate attitudes are beginning to be understood. We would have had to sweep masses of legislation away if everybody affected had to understand down to the last detail how the law would operate. Legislation can create understanding of appropriate responses and there is no reason why small firms should be any different in that respect. If some small firms less likely to have had experience of disabled workers show a lack of understanding, I hope that their attitude will change as people see the benefit of involving disabled people within the workplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that the clause will apply not only to small firms but to any employer? Will it apply to a firm employing just one person, even on a part-time basis; to a mother employing a nanny at home; or even to a Member of Parliament who employs a secretary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a general provision. If someone applies for work, the general attitude should be that disablement—unless it prevents the job's functions from being fulfilled—should not prevent employment being offered. There are the extra considerations of reasonableness and cost, but the disabled person must be considered fairly along with other applicants. The general bias against gender and racial discrimination should also apply to disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a worthwhile and appropriate principle to apply to Members of Parliament in employing staff, though something might have to be done about the buildings of Westminister to provide reasonable access for disabled people. I am presently trying to organise a celebration in Westminster for disabled people for when the Bill has passed through the Committee. It is difficult because the Jubilee Room would be the natural place for such a celebration but it is impossible for a host of disabled people to get there. A lift is available for the occasional one or two disabled people. Of course, all disabled people do not suffer from the specific disability of being unable to walk up a set of stairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that illustrate the fact that an employer, in common with a Member of Parliament, has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
no personal control over accommodation, which can make it impossible for him to comply? Any employer working in a building over which he has no personal control—individual Members of Parliament do not, they have a contract with the individual who works for them— would not even be able to start complying with these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House employs people directly and should therefore take the needs of disabled people into account. If that happened, it would have a knock-on effect on researchers, secretaries and others who are employed by Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised a point about clause 4(2)(d), which he said contains problematic language. We should associate ourselves with this provision and it should remain solidly in the Bill. The clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this section, 'discriminate' includes in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of section 2 above … excluding a qualified person from any employment or otherwise limiting his opportunities, status or benefits as an employee because of the disability of a person with whom he is known or believed to have a relationship or association".</p></blockquote>
That seems to describe situations in which the person concerned has connections, relationships and associations with the employees concerned, so discrimination should not take place. I do not know whether I have described that adequately, or whether any of my hon. Friends wishes to come to my aid to expand on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Friday I visited a precision engineering company in my constituency. I asked what the people there thought about the two Bills dealing with disabled people that Parliament is currently considering. Hon. Members will not be surprised to learn that they had not heard of either of them, because, like most small manufacturing firms, it is concentrating on trying to compete in a market that is getting tougher by the day. It is a subcontractor in the aerospace industry and is competing with subcontractors in the far east. It is a very tough market and the company constantly has to try to drive down its costs. I told the firm about the proposals in these two Bills. Like most employers, it is concerned about additional costs being imposed by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Wythenshawe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he explained the two Bills. What cost estimates of the Government's Bill and of our Bill did he give the company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not supply such detailed information. At least the Government Bill comes with a compliance cost assessment: this Bill has nothing attached to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Berry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingswood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government Bill has a fraudulent compliance cost assessment. The Government allege that it would be £17 billion. Nobody now believes that fraudulent estimate. Indeed, the Government could give us an accurate assessment if they wanted to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be interested to know the Bill's sponsor's estimate of the cost to employers. Perhaps he could tell us what costs he expects this clause to impose on employers. That is my concern. Contrary to what he said, it would be easier for large firms to cope with this measure, because if they had a very large work force—
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
say, 1,000 or 2,000 people—and if the Bill is to affect 6.5 million people, they would expect one in 10 of their work force or fewer to have some disability. A large firm ought to be able to cope with that more easily than a small firm. Generally speaking, large firms are able to cope with the cost of legislation and the burdens that Parliament imposes on business more easily than small firms. I am, therefore, naturally concerned about small firms. The clause covers any employer and thus anybody who employs anyone in any situation. That person need not necessarily run a business, but might simply employ someone to help him. The clause will, however, still apply to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the cost involved in the clause. I was not able, last Friday, to give the firm mentioned an estimate of the costs of the Government Bill or of this Bill. Both will, however, involve costs, and I fear that the costs of the clause will be excessive. I expressed that concern on Second Reading, but have heard nothing from the hon. Gentleman about the costs of the clause. Can he enlighten us about them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost of compliance was dealt with entirely inadequately during consideration of last year's version of the Bill. The Government should have produced a correct assessment, based on their own considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Too much focus is often placed on cost, rather than on a cost-benefit analysis. I wish I had brought with the a copy of a letter that the actor Nabil Shaban sent to his Member of Parliament. He played Sil in Dr. Who; Sil was a grasping character who used every opportunity to make money and exploit other people. Mr. Shaban wrote the letter in the character of Sil and said that his Member of Parliament in fact supported the Bill because it would generate a lot of money once people entered the goods and services market and got employment. It makes sound political sense for someone like Sil—a natural ally of the Tories—to support the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form of assessment needs extra balance. The matter was fully debated during consideration of previous versions of this Bill and of the Government's alternative Bill, and has been so here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond to the Minister's point about a relationship or an association, but I seem to be floundering somewhat The clause deals with cases of intentional discrimination, in which the employer is fully aware of why he is acting in a particular way. The wording of the clause makes it clear that such discrimination is not justified. It would prevent a carer— he might not necessarily be a relative, but a friend—from being treated less favourably because of the disability of the person he cared for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My exchange with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield was important. He explained to employers in his constituency what extra costs the Government Bill and this Bill would impose. He was, however, unable to give me any precise information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should briefly examine clause 4(5)(d), which covers
	<br><blockquote><p>"the availability of grants from public funds to defray the expense of any accommodation."</p></blockquote>
That factor must be taken into account.

11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my time as a Minister, capital grants for the first time were made available to employers to adapt their premises. The intention was to make it easier for them to employ disabled people. Much will depend on how much the Government are prepared to make available to help employers to improve access to their premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear much more from the Government about what they intend to do to help employers adapt what in many cases are elderly and inaccessible premises. Would not it be easier for the Government to comply, without any caveats, with the purposes of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield should tell the employers in his constituency that their contemporaries in America are saying that legislation such as this Bill is business-friendly. They are happy about the implementation of similar legislation in America. Let us give employers some good news. We should warn them of the difficulties, but at the same time we should assure them that we are not ahead of the world in this respect. Other countries have operated legislation such as this for some time and consider it business-friendly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have already dealt with a substantial rewrite of another clause IV, although the language of that one ended up even more woolly than the clause 4 that we are debating. However, on this clause 4, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East rightly picked up on my opening remark that new clause 3 would have been the counterpart of taking out the concept of "qualified disabled person". I realise that the Committee has dealt with that already, but new clause 3 still deserved to be spoken to. I shall not press the new clause, as I do not want to waste the Committee's time debating the same topic several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The responses of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East to my inquiries about association illustrate the difficulties with the Bill. He said that it was a nice concept to be associated with: that may be, but I do not know whether it would work as a piece of law. The provision broadens the Bill's scope greatly, and increases the number of people who might be covered by it. The problem lies with the word "known" in clause 4(2)(d). The immediate question is, known by whom? Does the employer have to be one of the people who knows, or can he claim that he did not know and so avoid liability to do anything under the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have been better in our discussions last week if the hon. Gentleman had accepted those of my amendments that would have changed the term "known" to formulations such as "known by the employer" or "if he could reasonably have expected to have known". That would have made the Bill better for disabled people. However, the hon. Gentleman's refusal to accept those amendments leaves us with the problem: how many people have to know something for it to be known in the sense set out in the clause; and does that something have to be known by the employer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause retains two of the key problems and difficulties of the Bill as a whole. First, there is the imprecise language in which it is expressed, and the term "known" is a good example of that. Secondly, there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
insufficient appreciation of the need to show that we are being fair to other people in introducing legislation that prevents discrimination against disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris) referred to the favourable reception for antidiscrimination legislation among many American employers—the attitude is not universal but it exists in many quarters that the right hon. Gentleman and I would respect. I hope that the same thing will happen in this country when the Disability Discrimination Bill is enacted later this year. However, in being business-friendly, the Americans with Disabilities Act contains a small employers' exemption which is not included in this Bill. Problems that could arise as a result of that were highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I share the objectives of clause 4, I remain gravely dissatisfied with it. It illustrates many of the problems that we have with the legislation—but that is the cross the Opposition Members must bear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to the United States Attorney Robert Mather who administers in the Department of Justice, it must be said in relation to the Americans with Disabilities Act that small employers in America who are caught by the legislation say that the law is more friendly to them than to anybody else. That is interesting, and it is what Robert Mather said when he visited Britain. He is at the coal face, administering the legislation, and is himself a severely disabled person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue becomes a question of what we mean by a small employer. People with 15 or fewer employees are exempt from the Americans with Disabilities Act—the figure was 25 when the process began but was altered to 15, although mere is no provision for it to be moved below that. My point stands: there is a clear sign in America of a greater sensitivity to the needs of small employers. We want small employers to become large employers; they would then be covered by the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister acknowledge that the reason for the small firm exemption in the Americans with Disabilities Act is that disabled people campaigned for that legislation because they wanted the same treatment as applies in the civil rights legislation? The argument was that because there is a small firms exemption which applies to discrimination on grounds of issues such as race, there should be a similar exemption in relation to the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Minister must know from the history of the ADA that it was not a conscious decision in the United States to exempt small firms because they were a special case. The decision was intended specifically to argue that disabled people wanted the same treatment as the groups covered by civil rights legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that people wanted the same treatment as others under civil rights legislation, but I have equally no doubt that there are reasons for that. There are reasons why other legislation has not been applied to small employers. It is not just accident or coincidence. The concept of a small employer's exemption did not arise from nowhere; it was included by the United States Congress in legislation for a reason. The same reasons hold true in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are arguing essentially the same case: Parliament has judged that the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 should not include a small firm exemption, so all that we are saying is that disabled people should be treated in exactly the same way. That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the argument very well. I have heard the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) explain it on many occasions. We are dealing with antidiscrimination legislation relating to disability. That asks more of employers than any sex or race legislation, and in this Bill we are discussing making adjustments and accommodations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a point which most members of the Committee will recognise. Overcoming discrimination on grounds of sex and race requires some of the elements that are needed to overcome discrimination on grounds of disability or ability. Costs can also be involved which certainly do not apply to sex or race. Does my hon. Friend the Minister also agree that, as much as we want small employers to become large employers, we also want people on income support to become taxpayers, and finding practical measures of helping to bring people into employment and overcoming what may be minor costs are also important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. He will know, as will the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe, that when we are considering the availability of public money, we should remember the access to work scheme, which my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Department of Employment launched last year. It is already a great help to a large number of disabled people.

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the broad intention behind the clause, which is clearly to prevent medical examinations being required or health questions being asked when the effect would be to discriminate unfairly against disabled people, and I recognise that there are similar provisions in the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the approach taken is, in some respects, unduly onerous and I wonder whether the obligations need to be spelled out in this way to achieve the desired objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers may legitimately decide, as part of their recruitment arrangements, to raise medical questions or to require medical examinations to establish whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
applicants meet the standards of health or fitness that are required to perform the job. Clause 4 already makes it unlawful to discriminate against disabled people in recruitment; therefore, such questions should not be asked, and such examinations could not be carried out, if their effect would be discriminatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the Disability Discrimination Bill works with regard to this issue is that a potential employer can ask questions, but if he then discriminates against disabled people on the basis of the answers, he can be subject to complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what my hon. Friend is saying, but I am not sure that he is being completely fair. Clause 5(1) is an exclusion from the general permission given in clause 5(2); if subsection 1 were not there, surely clause 5 would overcome the provision in clause 4?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I follow my hon. Friend, but perhaps I may tell him my other concerns about clause 5(1), which could work to the detriment of a disabled applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A prospective employer, for example, would be prevented from asking questions that were designed to determine whether applicants—who may or may not be known to be disabled—needed special arrangements to come for an interview, or whether they were able to use ancillary facilities such as car parks and rest rooms. Not all medical tests and questions are purely for the employer's benefit; some are needed to find out how a person with a disability could best be accommodated, including in matters that might be unrelated to job functions. Even if the restrictions that would be imposed by clause 5(1) were necessary—and I am not sure that that is so, although my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham argues that they are—I doubt that they would always result in good employment practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what members of the Committee think about cases where the employer might need to make special arrangements for a disabled job applicant to attend an interview. How is the employer expected to know whether such arrangements are needed when he would risk a complaint if he were to ask such questions? The Bill justifies asking questions about disability only when they are asked to ascertain the applicant's ability to perform job-related functions, but help needed for an interview or to be able to get to work does not necessarily fall into that category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may have several problems, but my problem is that I am due to go and speak in Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause may be imperfect or may raise questions that need answering, but it raises an issue on which we should be able to reach agreement. If the Bill makes progress, that would overcome the difficulties, fulfil the aims of the first and second subsections and get the second part of the clause right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a favourite refrain of my hon. Friend—that there must be consensus and a way to resolve the issue. My point is that situations in which people might ask discriminatory questions of the sort we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
are discussing are covered, but in a different way, by the Government Bill—which will, unless I am greatly mistaken, become law later this year. I am explaining why we have chosen that different approach. There are problems with the clause—I do not know whether they have been foreseen, but if they have and there are ways round them, the Committee needs to know about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People with disabilities have, in common with others, certain protection under the Access to Medical Reports Act 1988. Prospective employees who give their consent to the supply of a medical report from a practitioner to an employer—and no report should be supplied without consent—normally have the right to require access before it is supplied. Where the employee has been given access, the report should not be supplied to the employer unless and until the employee consents. The employee is entitled to write to the medical practitioner asking him to amend any part of the report which he considers incorrect or misleading before the report is given to the employer. If such a request is made, the practitioner must agree to the request. If he does not, he must attach a statement to the report setting out the employee's view if he so requests. Thus the individual already has some control over what information, if any, is given to the employer, and will know what has been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the objective of 5(2)(a), which is an interesting part of the clause, is to prevent employers from making a job offer to a disabled person contingent on that person passing a medical test, where they would not make such a contingency when offering a job to a non-disabled person. I regard that as a restriction that it is unnecessary to impose to ensure that the individual is safeguarded against unfair discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases are bound to arise in which employers become aware of an applicant's disability only at interview. They may then have a perfectly legitimate concern about whether the disability is compatible with the requirements of the job, or whether it might, for example, give rise to exceptional health or safety risks. What are employers to do in such cases? It would obviously be unfair to the applicant to reject him or her on the mere possibility of a problem; on the other hand, it would equally obviously be an unreasonable imposition to expect employers to adopt a general policy of pre-testing all recruits, just in case there might one day arise the possibility of recruiting someone whose disability might be thought to pose a particular risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the drafters of the Bill intend that all applicants for employment should be subject to such an examination? We all hear about jobs with hundreds of applicants. Does that mean that everyone who applies—not just those who are short-listed or interviewed—will be subject to the same examination? If that is the intention, it is ludicrous. If that is not the intention, it should be worded differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see two problems in regard to the confidentiality provisions in clause 5(2)(b) and the related provisions in clause 5(3). First, while I imagine that all of us would agree that an individual's medical records should be kept confidential, except to the extent that there is a genuine need to know, we have no legislation in place asserting that principle for employees generally, beyond the requirements in the Access to Medical Reports Act. I am not at all convinced that Parliament should introduce a
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
unique provision of that type for disabled people. My second, more detailed, concern about 5(2)(b) is that it does not cover all those who might legitimately need to know—for example, fellow employees who might in an emergency need to give special assistance to a disabled person. The reference to supervisors and managers being informed under clause 5(2)(b)(i) may not cover all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there are many problems with the clause. How can an employer ensure that health and safety is maintained if he is prevented from telling a disabled person's colleagues about aspects of the disability that might call for special consideration? Is there no instance in which an employer could tell other employees, apart from safety officers and first-aiders, about a person's disability, to help to ensure health and safety for that person or for others? What would happen if an individual gave permission for information about his disability to be passed to colleagues? The Bill makes no provision for that and the employer would be in breach of the law as much as if he so acted without permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such are the questions on which I would welcome a response from members of the Committee. My main concern is with clause 5(2)(a) but, as I have explained, I have others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the note in the margin says that the clause is about medical examinations, which most of it is, clause 5(1) deals with medical examinations or general inquiries. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"an employer shall not … make enquiries of an applicant for employment as to whether he is a disabled person".</p></blockquote>
That means that an employer cannot ask an applicant whether he is disabled or ask about the nature of his disabilities, with one exception: such inquiries are allowed if their object is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to ascertain the ability of the applicant to perform job-related functions."</p></blockquote>
I should like to ask the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East what "job-related functions" means. How narrow is it? Does it mean carrying out the job in question, or does it include all the other functions that we would expect to be carried out in order for the job to be done properly—for example, getting from the door of the premises to the place at which the job is carried out, going to the canteen to eat and carrying out other functions that are not directly related to the job. This is an important matter. The only exception to the extraordinary statement that an employer cannot make inquiries to applicants about disablement demands clarification in relation to the width of "job-related functions".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argued in relation to clause 5(1) that information could not be asked of an applicant with the purpose of making provision for access by the applicant to the interview. There is nothing in the subsection that would prohibit an employer from telling an applicant that he or she was entitled, without obligation, to inform the employer of any need for special arrangements. The Bill generally provides for improvements in access to all sorts of places for disabled people. That will have a knock-on effect. If an employer fails to make the inquiry, it will not necessarily mean that the person will be seriously inhibited from turning up for an interview.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if a deaf person has applied for a job and the employer wishes to find out whether any of the 10 people who are to attend an interview are deaf so that he can provide whatever assistance is necessary? He might want to provide a sign language interpreter or other assistance. Under the clause, he would not be allowed to
	<br><blockquote><p>"make enquiries of an applicant for employment as to whether he is a disabled person or as to the nature or severity of any impairment".</p></blockquote>
How is an employer to cope with that eventuality? Does an applicant turn up and then have to explain the situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Employers are not allowed to make such inquiries, but that should not prevent them from asking applicants who are invited to attend an interview whether they have any requirements of that nature. That is different from trying to discover, for their own purposes, whether an applicant is disabled. They could ask applicants a general question about whether they require any special assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that an exception to the rule that an employer cannot make inquiries of an applicant for employment
	<br><blockquote><p>"as to whether he is a disabled person or as to the nature or severity of any impairment"?</p></blockquote>
If I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly, an employer would be able to ask, "Are you disabled in some way which we have to provide for when you come to the interview?" That is not provided for in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not provided for in the Bill, but the subsection does not exclude it. That is the logic of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the purpose of clause 5(1) to ensure that the employer's request for information relates to whether or not an applicant can perform the job-related functions? The clause seeks to prevent the employer from asking for additional information at that stage that might make him think, "I couldn't possibly consider employing this person, because I would have to provide reasonable accommodation and that might cost the money."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employer's response to the problem of providing reasonable accommodation should come after the decision on employment has been made, not before. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the purpose of the clause is to prevent information being available in advance of interview that could prejudice the chances of the disabled applicant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is being a bit pedantic on this matter. The clause would clearly not prevent the applicant from providing information about his requirements in order to attend the interview. It does not present the barriers that the Minister claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked how widely the term "job-related functions" applies. He said that certain things had to be done in connection with the job that were job related, such as going to the canteen and entering the building, but were not a precise part of the performance of the task. I should have thought that job-related functions can be defined and should be covered in the Bill in a similar way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere, we want job-related matters to be taken into account when employers provide facilities. A person's disability, which might mean that he or she cannot share in the full job, is a question not only of that person's medical incapacity but of the work done by the employer to ensure that general access facilities are provided. Those two matters are related.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have been confused earlier when I said that my responses to the Minister were in connection with subsection (2) rather than subsection (1). However, I shall be happy to respond to any further questions from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now I am confused. I do not think that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has yet responded to my questions about clause 5(2)(a), unless I have misinterpreted his closing remarks. I asked whether that paragraph applied to all applicants for the same kind of employment. To extend the example that I described before, the 10 people brought in for interview may have been selected from 100 applicants. When one or two people are then chosen for employment and undergo the medical examination permitted under clause 5(2), as the hon. Member for Kingswood described, does that mean that all 100 applicants have to have an examination? I find that hard to believe, but that is what clause 5(2)(a) requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East says that I am being pedantic, but he should meet some lawyers: they would be a lot more pedantic in court than I have been this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a good point about the language of clause 5(2)(a), but it refers to all applicants shortlisted for interview. That must be what it means, as it would make no sense at all to apply the provision to the 200 people who might apply for a job. No employer would be stupid enough to interview all those applicants. In my experience, one makes a judgment on the basis of the application and invites in for interview four, six or however many candidates one chooses. I know of no circumstances in which an employer would interview every single applicant for a job. He would never get through it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman and I are on the same wavelength, as occasionally happens. I do not think that the people who drafted the Bill meant the provision to apply to "all applicants", but that is what they put. I should like the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East at least to tell the Committee how that provision could be rephrased, and whether he will give a commitment to return to the question at some putative later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East said that I was being pedantic about the business of the inquiries made of people coming to be interviewed. The hon. Gentleman has not persuaded me that the clause gets round the problem. Unless the term "job-related functions" is meant to be interpreted extremely widely— as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield noted— the clause would forbid an employer to ask an applicant important questions about coming for an interview.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
Can the hon. Gentleman tell us more about Clause 5(2)(a)? It is wrong, and does not seem to say what it is meant to say. I also asked about the health and safety aspect. Are only supervisors, managers, and first aid and safety personnel to be informed about the individual's disability? Should not colleagues be informed so that they can adjust their working practices and assist in an emergency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our short debate on clause 5 illustrates the value of the Committee process and, in particular, of my hon. Friend the Minister's willingness to participate so fully. He identifies several practical considerations that deserve careful consideration by the Committee and by those of us who are keen for the Bill to reach the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 5(1), my hon. Friend the Minister made more of the difficulty than it is worth. There is an evil that we must guard against: it is the possibility and practice—of which there are too many instances—of employers effectively using a medical screening procedure to discriminate against disabled applicants whom they do not want to employ. It is important that legislation effectively address that practice, which, I am sure, all members of the Committee find odious, regardless of their views on particular aspects of the Bill. We can get round that difficulty. The drafting of the Bill does not prevent an employer who is seeking applications for a job from inviting applicants to say whether they need assistance to make their application. It is equally open to applicants to get in touch with the employer, to say that they want to apply for a job and that it might be helpful if they mentioned their circumstances. The difficulty that my hon. Friend identified in clause 5(1) can be overcome in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister drew attention to what he suspected was deficient drafting in clause 5(2)(a), and he might be right that the drafting could be improved. That is why the Committee is so useful. It is, however, perfectly obvious in context that an offer of employment has been made to the applicants referred to in (2)(a). It seems obvious that that is how we should interpret the clause. We could, however, refine the drafting to achieve a more perfect clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last difficulty that my hon. Friend the Minister mentioned was that of whether information about an employee's disability should be available only to supervisors and managers. We must act sensitively in this matter. An organisation's employees will of course find out that someone has a disability. That should not be a cause of embarrassment. Equally, however, respect for the individual's privacy and dignity demands that the full dossier of his disabilities should not be the common property of everyone who works in the firm. A need-to-know principle should be applied, and it seems sensible, from that point of view, for the Bill to be drafted as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree strongly with the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth) about the interpretation of clause 5(2)(a). We have had this discussion before, although it may have been with a different Minister—I tend to forget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I labour under the disadvantage of not being a lawyer, but as a layperson, I interpret subsection (2) as being
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
about post-offer examinations. When, therefore, it states that it is okay for an employer to require a medical examination of a disabled person "after an offer" if all applicants are dealt with in the same way, I interpret that to mean that after the offer, if a disabled person is required to undergo a medical examination, then everybody has to undergo a medical examination. I do not mean everybody who applied for the job, or everybody who was short-listed, or everybody who was interviewed; clause 5(2) is about the post-offer situation. Of course we may need to improve on the drafting, but the meaning is clear to me. We have had this debate before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is just that we now have two different interpretations. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) says that the clause means short-listed applicants, but the hon. Gentleman says that it means people who have been offered the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, this is one of those rare occasions when I can disagree in public with a colleague on the Front Bench and not be completely hammered for so doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important thing is that we have established that the clause was never meant to apply to every applicant for the job. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood and I are not that far apart. He will be aware that there are a number of firms—perhaps more at senior managerial and executive levels—that make it a stipulation after the offer of a job that it is conditional on a medical examination. All we are saying, as my hon. Friend said, is that subsection (2) applies to the post-offer situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Berry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am never far apart from my colleagues on the Front Bench, as they know. I understand why the Minister has raised the point; we need to be clear about it. However, we have discussed it before and it is clear that clause 5(2) applies to the post-offer situation. It is simply about disabled people being treated in the same way as everyone else—which is, of course, what the whole Bill is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of subsection (2)(a) is to prohibit the medical from being reserved only for disabled applicants, especially those who are about to be or who are being offered employment, and it applies only to those applicants who have been made an offer and who are then to be examined. If there is ambiguity in the clause, we can consider it at a later stage in the light of the comments that have been made, including those made by my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(b)(ii) is about who is to have information supplied. It is important to bear in mind that information should be given on a need-to-know basis and that care should be taken over the extent of that information. Subsection (2) might need to be adjusted to clarify the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is, an employee could give permission for certain confidential information to be supplied to assist colleagues as well as himself or herself. It is not, however, helpful for confidential information, which is held by the employer and which might need to be used by safety and other officers in different circumstances, to be generally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
available. Other information of a personal nature that would be held by employers about employees would not be expected to be so widely available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those two reservations about the intention of the measure and the general value of the provisions in it, and provided that there is further examination of the wording, I want the clause to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I think that we have made a little progress again. I think that the hon. Gentleman said that he would return to the wording of clause 5(2)(a)—that is necessary. The hon. Member for Kingswood said that we had had the debate before. If so, matters should have been put right by now. Our problem was illustrated by the fact that we heard two different interpretations within a few minutes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beasonsfield pointed out. Indeed, there were three different interpretations if one includes the literal interpretation that, no doubt, some lawyer or other would put on clause 5(2)(a).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has been liberal in his tabling of amendments hitherto. Is he willing to table an amendment on Report to refine and improve clause 5(2)(a)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I would be happy to take up my hon. Friend's offer—although I am often criticised for tabling amendments. Discussions such as this illustrate how many amendments one could have tabled to legislation of this type. Clause 5(2)(a) is a measure that we all agree needs amending in some way in order to make it mean what it was supposed to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still anxious about clause 5(1). My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon made various points about it. In the Bill, there is a duty on employers to make a reasonable accommodation, and I am not sure how employers can decide whether what is being requested is reasonable unless they know about the effects of a person's disability. Employers must have the information about the disability to make the judgment that the Bill requires. There is a general problem with the approach taken on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon about people having to be sensitive about giving information to others. One of our problems is that it appears that employers are forbidden to give information to people, except for those in certain categories. I think that we can all readily envisage situations when other people might need the information. It might be of benefit to disabled people for others to have that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have demonstrated some problems with the clause. As I said, the Disability Discrimination Bill deals with the same subject differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the intervention of the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon, has the Minister any plans at all for reducing the number of amendments in his name? That matter was raised previously and the Minister suggested that we could come back to it and talk it over. A former Member of Parliament for Beaconsfield used to talk as Prime Minister about the "glut of prosperity" during his premiership. Almost by common consent, we
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
have a glut of amendments here. Has the Minister any intention of withdrawing any of the amendments in his name?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether it is in order to discuss the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strictly speaking, it is not. The question was out of order and an answer would be out of order—but I want to hear the reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I take that as a licence to respond. I did not move an amendment earlier today and there may be other occasions when I want not to. I was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon to think of other amendments, but in an earlier debate on clause 2, which the Committee decided needed amendment in some form, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East asked my why I had not tabled amendments. I come under countervailing pressures on this, but I shall review amendments as and when we come to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we distinguish between the class of amendments that my hon. Friend might table, which might be genuinely intended to assist the drafters of legislation better to achieve their objectives, and the amendments that my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed some licence on this matter, partly because I have an interest myself in how many amendments are tabled. However, it would be going too far for the Minister to respond to the hon. Gentleman's question. I hope that he will resist that temptation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, Mr. Hogg, I must resist the temptation. I have now quite forgotten where I was in debating clause 5, on which I have not tabled amendments. As I have demonstrated, I could have tabled a number of amendments on the clause. I think that I have demonstrated that one or two of them might have been well founded.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not tabled any amendments to clause 6, so I may be criticised, as I was on clause 5. However, I have a couple of significant questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the Bill's sponsors envisage the clause working in a case where a disabled applicant is prevented from joining a partnership because he is unable to gain access to the relevant premises? The clause provides for someone to join a partnership but does not seem to incorporate the concept of reasonable accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
Clause 4 dealt with general employment matters and defined one aspect of discrimination as
	<br><blockquote><p>"failing to make reasonable accommodation".</p></blockquote>
Why does not that important element of clause 4 find a place in clause 6, which is silent on the issue? Does not a partnership have to make such reasonable accommodation? It should be in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another question about reasonable accommodation. If premises or other accommodation have to be adapted, who would pay for it? Would other partners be expected to find the money from their own pockets? There may only be a few partners or perhaps even only one other partner. The clause contains no exemption for small partnerships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is reasonable accommodation intended to be part of the clause? Does the hon. Gentleman plan to include it? If it is intended, who will pay for reasonable accommodation—the person joining as a partner, or those who are already partners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has revealed that stand part debates can be more fruitful man debates on amendments. He has used the debate to probe specific points, to make his views known and to elicit our response. Sometimes he has interesting and reasonable things to say in our debates. By contrast, debates on amendments tend to turn one Bill into another and cause us to plod into a desert with amendment following amendment. We welcome short, stand part debates and will respond to the Minister's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the term "reasonable accommodation" was incorporated earlier in the Bill and should also apply here. That is a sensible suggestion, and merits consideration as the debate on the Bill develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked who would pay. Presumably he wants the Bill to contain some provision about that. We are talking about partnerships involving new and established partners. If the partners are to provide the money, it would be sensible for both partners to share any costs that are incurred. I hope that the Committee can agree to let the clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the clause not apply to potential or prospective partners? For example, people may be considering setting up a partnership for the first time. They might decide not to admit someone to the partnership because of that person's disability. Should not the clause be extended to cover that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I though that we were applying the clause to such a circumstance. It applies to partners in a firm and to potential partners. How does the clause not cover the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too am unsure of the answer to the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. However, clause 6(a) provides arrangements for determining who should be a partner. That may cover people setting up a partnership, but I am not sure. That is a further illustration of my point that legislation about partnerships is fraught with difficulty. It is more difficult than the clause makes it look. It think that the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East implied that he would have to return to the problem of reasonable
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
accommodation at a subsequent stage, if there is one. I am grateful for that assurance, and I think that that would help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of who would pay remains. As the hon. Gentleman said, there would be a new partner and some existing partners. But if there was only one existing partner and one new partner, the disabled person could end up having to pay the entire cost of his own reasonable accommodation. I am not sure that that is the Bill's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows that problems remain with the clause. I hope that the Bill's sponsors will turn their minds to them and give them further consideration. Like other clauses that we have debated, clause 6 would have to be improved before it added up to workable legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East enjoys these little stand part debates, so I will add to his pleasure by precipitating another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 refers to trade unions, employers' organisations and other bodies. Clause 7(2) contains a sudden reference to "reasonable modifications" for disabled people. What does that undefined term mean, given that the Bill uses the term "reasonable accommodation" in all previous clauses? Is the new term meant to differ from "reasonable accommodation" as used elsewhere in part III, or does it differ from the term "reasonable modification" used only in part IV? Perhaps the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East should consider those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the clause contains no clear "reasonable accommodation" requirement in its provisions relating to access to benefits, facilities or services. How will the clause work in the case, for example, of a deaf trade union member who wished to attend a trade union meeting? The clause seems to specify that he would have to become a member of the union but does not place the union under any obligation to make reasonable accommodation. It provides only that a disabled person is eligible to join. That is confusing and needs to be clarified if the clause is to be workable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no provision for cases in which discrimination might be justified. May we have an explanation of the effect of the clause in a case where, for example, a trade union delegation had to visit a construction site? Exclusion of a person in a wheelchair might be justified if that site were inaccessible, yet if that were construed as any other detriment, as it would seem to, it would be unlawful and it would also be unlawful to take someone else instead. So I have some concerns about the clause which may need further work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with membership organisations. That includes unions, employers, trades
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
and professions, but why does it stop there? Why does not it include voluntary organisations and charities with members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with reasonable modification to the membership rules, and so on, of organisations. That is not the same as the notion of reasonable accommodation. There is a difference in the nature of the organisations under discussion. The Minister talked about a blind member attending a trade union branch meeting and the problems that may be associated with that. Unions are often required to hire rooms to hold meetings, which are not always held at the same premises. It might be argued that the clause should include details to cover such cases. The clause establishes that there should be no restrictions in the rules of the organisation and the eligibility for membership. It does not cover the question of reasonable accommodation, which was raised by the Minister in relation to clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must attempt to provide for the expansion of rights for disabled people in differing areas that extend and develop those areas. The point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on whether other organisations such as charities need to be added to the provision might be more an argument for having an extra clause. We have not yet finished dealing with the clause and I do not know whether we shall finish it today. If the hon.

Member for Beaconsfield is that that issue is covered in clause 12, in terms of the services which those organisations he mentioned offer as part of their membership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Beaconsfield may still be drawing a distinction between goods and services that one provided by charities and the people who work for charities, although that matter is dealt with in earlier provisions on employment in organisations. The hon. Gentleman raised the particular problem of voluntary workers, who should not be inhibited from performing their tasks on a voluntary basis on behalf of the community. That is an important point and one that we should consider and develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is also the position of private clubs—which is a controversial area—and political parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not my practice to get involved in these matters, but this part of the Bill covers employment provision. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's question is, strictly speaking, in order. That may help everybody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essentially, the hon. Gentleman's concerns are covered in other parts of the Bill. We should not add charities, voluntary organisations and other bodies to this clause. It deals with trade unions and I have sought to explain why the term "reasonable modification" is acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I found your clarification a little confusing. It is true that part III deals with employment, but clause 7 does not refer
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
to employment and I thought it was supposed to be about the terms on which someone could become a member of an organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the hon. Gentleman's point of order—I am not sure that it is one, but never mind— confusing. The whole point of clause 7 is to make it clear that, under the Bill, a trade union is an organisation in the context of employment and for employment purposes. The hon. Gentleman nods in agreement. Life is improving for members of the Chairman's panel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a most elegant ruling, Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the response of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield need not worry, because we shall later deal with the subject of clubs. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East explained that the clause means to say "reasonable modification" and not "reasonable accommodation". It still troubles me that that is not defined. It is another issue on which our friends, the pedantic lawyers, who keep cropping up in our discussions, will have a field day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the term is meant to mean something different or what it is exactly meant to mean in this situation, but I understand what the hon. Gentleman means it to mean. It is different from accommodation because it relates to the membership rules of the organisation. The hon. Gentleman said that the organisation concerned was not expected to provide reasonable accommodation. I am not sure whether it is the right approach to include trade unions in the Bill. After all, "accommodation" does not refer only to the room in which an activity is physically held, although there is no reason why we should not say that a room that is accessible should be used. It might also refer to facilities that were provided, and they might include a sign language interpreter. A trade union should provide the necessary facilities in whatever room it meets. If they are to be included in the Bill, I am not sure that trade unions should be in the special position of not having to provide reasonable accommodation. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East could have taken his Bill a little further and no doubt he will reflect on that advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here I am again, Mr. Hogg!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 8 covers qualifying bodies and subsection (2)(c) refers to "reasonable modification". Again, the problem is that that is not defined. We must be clear about how "reasonable modification" here differs from "reasonable accommodation" as used elsewhere in part III. Is cost a factor that can be taken into account when deciding what is reasonable and what other factors are to be included? The concept of undue prejudice arose in clause 4 and I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
objected to that. If "reasonable" is good enough in clause 8 without the concept of undue prejudice, why is the concept needed elsewhere?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman intend that qualifying bodies should always have to make examination papers available in Braille and in audio form? Must they also be made available in pictorial form for people with learning disabilities? Would the thousands of standards established by examining bodies have to be modified to take account of the wide variety of impairment, and how quickly would that need to be done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is silent on qualifications which are inherently more difficult for people with specific disabilities to obtain. How would it apply to a foreign language qualification for which oral proficiency is an integral requirement? For example, how could adjustment or modification be made for someone with a speech impairment? Difficulties arise in trying to interpret how wide the hon. Gentleman intends the provision to be. Does he intend all examinations to be made available in all possible formats? I would welcome clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has rightly drawn attention to the difficulties. The purpose of the legislation is to find ways to overcome such difficulties. He might agree that it is not reasonable for him to ask that reasonableness should be fully defined in primary legislation or even in regulations. The concept of reasonableness is strongly established in law. It is adumbrated in the Education Act 1944 and other important legislation. The courts have much practice in interpreting the meaning of reasonableness and the Minister need not be afraid of the use of the concept in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems desirable that examinations for qualifications should be available in Braille, audio or pictorial form, and we should be looking towards that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause should be seen in the general context of the Bill. Two areas—the role of the Secretary of State and the role of the Disability Rights Commission—help to establish the practical scope of the provisions. I do not accept the problems that the Minister is raising, which seem to be logical quibbles, ignoring the general principles contained elsewhere in the Bill which feed back to the important provisions relating to people gaining qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very important to take on board the fact that a person has a speech impediment if he is trying to gain a foreign language qualification. If that person was well qualified, his ability to speak that foreign language might be on a par with his ability to use his native language. It is not beyond the ability of those who set examinations to take such matters into account. We should welcome a law which encourages that development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only a short contribution on the clause—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a short clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed only a short clause. The Government do not oppose anti-discrimination legislation covering employment agencies—they are covered in the Government's Disability Discrimination Bill. I am a little puzzled to know what the clause adds to the coverage of employment agencies elsewhere in the Bill. As I understand it, clause 4 covers employment agencies in their capacity as employers, and clause 12 covers them in their capacity as providers of services to the public, including job applicants, so I am not sure of the purpose of clause 9. Why have employment agencies been singled out for their own special clause when they seem to be covered by other provisions in the Bill? In my experience, duplicating provisions in legislation tends to cause more problems than it is worm; so should the clause be in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reasons why the clause is in the Bill are similar to the reasons for including clause 7, which relates to trade unions. Although they are generally covered by other parts of the Bill as employers and providers of services, trade unions and employment agencies have a particularly important relationship with the employment market and people's rights in employment. It is therefore important that their position should be developed beyond the general provisions contained elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hague</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the point about unions is that they have a membership. Clause 7 prohibited them from discriminating against anyone who wanted to be a member. They were already covered in terms of employment and provision of services. Employment agencies are not the same. Unlike trade unions, they do not have a membership or any other characteristic that is not already covered by clauses 4 and 12, so I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Employment agencies have a special relationship with the employment market. How they conduct their business and whether they discriminate internally against disabled people is therefore of great importance. They are a leading element in helping to shape the nature of anti-discrimination in employment. They should not discriminate as employers; they should provide services without hindrance to people who are disabled; and, in terms of placing people in the employment market, they should be above board. That is the logic behind the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is a strong case for the clause, which deals specifically with the duties of employment agencies, because they are in a position that places them midway between employers and providers of services. They increasingly act as recruitment agencies. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
can do no harm to underline, through the presence of the clause, the duty that should lie upon them. Their role is becoming increasingly important in the ever more volatile labour market resulting from the development of the global economy. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North-East was right to include a clause devoted to defining the responsibilities of employment agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked earlier about clause 7.1 now see that clause 12(3)(j) refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"membership of associations, clubs or other organisations".</p></blockquote>
It would appear that clause 7 is redundant, as it dealt with membership of other organisations. Clause 9 is also redundant, because clause 12(3)(i) refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the services of any profession or trade"</p></blockquote>
and an employment agency is in the trade of providing a service. The difficulty arising from repetition in legislation is that people may conclude that if one refers to something specifically, one does not mean to refer to something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alfred Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman noticed that clause 12 is also linked to clause IS, which gives certain powers to the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interesting thing about clause 12 is that it, too, gives extra powers to the Secretary of State. Clause 12(3)(o) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such other facilities and services as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That is real belt-and-braces stuff. Clause 12 deals with a whole range of goods and services, including membership of an organisation and services provided by an employment agency. I understand why that is so. As you have explained, Mr. Hogg, this part of the Bill deals with employment and those references put the matter beyond any doubt. However, the difficulty with that approach is that it might raise doubts about other matters, which are not specially referred to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
