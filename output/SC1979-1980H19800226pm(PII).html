	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. We shall be seeking copper-bottomed guarantees for the pensioners and existing staff of British Rail. I do not know how long you will be in the Chair, Mr. Dean, but you will not need to be there long to realise that I quickly exhaust my fund of knowledge on pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am ready and eager to be corrected, but my understanding is that what might be described as the current element in the various pension schemes is being funded—that is, the necessary amounts are being paid in at present so that with proper investment they will accrue to the advantage of pensioners and ultimately be paid out as pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point I wish to raise with the Minister, although I do not expect him to deal with it now. Many of my constituents who work for British Rail are concerned about a rumour that, due to its present cash flow problems, for the past few months British Rail has not been making the appropriate contributions to the pension schemes. I shall be grateful if the Minister will deal with that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be best if I dealt with that now. As far as I know, it is absolutely untrue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I know it is untrue, but I hope that the Minister will not need to reflect. That is no reflection on the Minister. I am simply raising the point that this is a feeling, or a nasty sensation, that a considerable number of my railway employee constituents are bothered about. I do not seek to give great currency to that feeling, but it should be publicly stamped upon if it is false. No doubt the Minister will look into that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1900</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's motives. If it were true, British Rail would certainly have come to me. It has not done so, and I can, therefore, categorically say that it is untrue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well. I shall be happy to convey that information to my constituents. As their pensions are involved, I am sure that they will be equally happy. We must hope that that position continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other element of the pension schemes is referred to in all the documents as the historic element. Instead of funding, as in the past, the Government now propose a pay-as-you-go scheme. That is not pay-in, but pay-out-as-you-go. In other words, as the pension payments become necessary the Government will make them up to the proper level. That is my understanding of the system, but as I said, I am ready to be corrected by others with a greater knowledge and skill in these matters than mine—and they do not need much greater knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial point here is that as each year goes by the Minister will make up the shortfall, or some of it, for the period and pay it out. There is the question of when, which I shall come to shortly. But it is not clear to me from part III that all of the shortfall will be made up. We shall be seeking confirmation on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will do the paying and he will not fund. That is the change from funding to pay-as-you-go. The Minister's view is that basically the only change proposed is from funding to pay-as-you-so, and the Minister picks up the tab, whatever method is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the eminently sensible and practical points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), who has a long experience of railway pensions and has been drawing on that experience to the advantage of the Committee in a way that I cannot, a further question is this. Why have the Government introduced what can be described as this deferred payment scheme? That is what it is, except that with luck the payments will not be behindhand but current, and not accumulated prior to being paid out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that the Public Accounts Committee thought that a bad thing, that the degree of funding contem-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1901</span>
plated for British Rail pensions was as large and as big a proportion of various things such as, no doubt, the public sector borrowing requirement, and so on. But I suspect that to some extent the views of the Public Accounts Committee may have reflected the slightly jaundiced view of Conservative Members about public sector pensions in the first place. It may have felt that spending money on public sector pensions was not altogether a good thing, however it was done, but particularly if funded, because of the large sums involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pay-as-you-go could be described in economic terms as expansionary. To that extent it would be welcome, because any expansion of the economy would be welcome. It also has the advantage for the Government of being cheaper in the short run. I emphasise "in the short run". There is no immediate need for large sums for funding. One does not need to make any provision now for future inflation. Conversely, one must continue providing in the future funds that have not been saved up for in the past. In that sense it is advantageous for the Government, particularly with their present obsession with reductions in public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any reduction of public expenditure in this sphere now carries with it in the inevitable consequence that there will be an increase in public expenditure later. The sums which are not being accumulated now will have to be paid out directly, without saving, in the future. I regard this as all of a piece, in that sense, with other aspects of the Bill—in particular the selling off of the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Selling off public assets is similar to stopping funding. Oddly enough it is wildly at variance with what I am sure is the generally prudent approach adopted by the Prime Minister's much-talked-about grocer father. I cannot believe that he would behave in such a way. I imagine that he would agree with very secure funding, certainly not in flogging off all the assets to get a short-term gain for one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I have doubts about the general economic approach. It is not based on a prudent approach to economic matters or to pensions. It seems to be a typical Treasury short-term approach—that is, to save a few bob now and when problems arise in the future to deal with them as best one can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1902</span>
The Minister commended the non-funding—that is, the pay-as-you-go—approach on the ground that it was his Department's contribution to savings in public expenditure. I should be grateful to know whether he and the Department are receiving full credit for that. There are substantial savings from such funding. If he is being given all the credit, it seems to me that he was not going to receive any money at all for transport expenditure from any other source and that the funding of pensions can be envisaged as the bulk of public expenditure on transport for the next year or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other question concerns something that the Minister raised on Second Reading, when he told the House:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I might say that the board has also argued that the funding payments provided under the existing funding orders are not enough to fund the deficiencies fully."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c.1131.]</p></blockquote>
If I understand that aright, it amounts to an unfunded deficiency. I should like to know whether the Minister's proposals, not for funding but for pay-as-you-go, will meet the whole of the difference between the funded part of the schemes and the totality that is paid out, including the under-funding from the 1974 and 1978 arrangements that the board spoke about. That is something which the pensioners are entitled to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payments under subsection (1) shall be made,"—</p></blockquote>
we now come to a phrase about which I am not too keen—
	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as practicable, not later than the day on which the pensions, increases and expenses to which they relate fall to be paid or incurred."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that if the pensions scheme is under an obligation to pay out money to pensioners by a particular date, there is absolutely no reason why the Minister should not be under a similar obligation. It would be most unfortunate if, as a result of this let-out—the words "so far as practicable"—the Minister's pay-as-you-go make-up were delayed in any way so as to cause problems either for the pension schemes or, more importantly, for the pensioners themselves. Therefore, I seek an explanation as to why that phrase needs to be included in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is general concern about pensioners' security. But there is another
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1903</span>
detailed matter that I should like to raise at this stage which in a sense is the nub of part III. Certain issues of principle are involved. I am not attempting to score points, but I am not clear from this clause or any other, or from any explanatory memoranda, whether the pay-as-you-go proposals as formulated in the clauses that we shall consider could work to the pensioners' disadvantage, in that surpluses accrued by funding one scheme may be taken into consideration towards the Minister's total contribution to make up the shortfall on the schemes in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The usual position with funded pension schemes is that if there is an excess of money above what the actuaries regard as necessary, both to pay current pensions and to meet future obligations, the trustees can consider inproving benefits to existing and future pensioners. As I read the Bill, I am not at all clear whether surpluses accrued on one or two schemes—and there are a large number of small schemes involved—may be taken away, to the disadvantage of pensioner members, and used to reduce what might be described as the Minister's liability to contribute to the total. I am concerned about that clawback aspect, particularly when one or two schemes may be in surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point occurs to me on examining the provisions of clause 43 and others. The matter is difficult because some parts of clause 43 do not make any sense unless one reads subsequent clauses. Consequently, it is rather difficult for me even to explain some of the problems that have occurred to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, something which so far as I can see has been raised in some of the meetings that the Minister has had with pension scheme representatives is whether, in the face of the possibility of a dubious or arguable actuarial assessment of the shortfall on the funded schemes, the current schemes which are self-funding may be endangered. A scheme's actuaries might see a shortfall which could be made up only by not paying in sufficient funds to the currently-running element of the scheme that is self-funding, or possibly by—this is what could bother pensioners—reducing pensions from the current funded schemes to make up for losses against which the trustees felt they had to secure themselves as a result of the actuarial assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that there may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1904</span>
severe problems for trustees in such circumstances. If they find that there is a shortfall in one sphere and the Minister's actuaries are adamant that they will not make that up above a certain point, they are faced with a difficult decision concerning their other responsibilities. They cannot ignore their obligation to pay close attention to a shortfall in one aspect of the scheme. They may therefore feel obliged to pay less into the current funding, making damaging changes to the pensions now being paid, or to make reductions in the pension arrangements for future pensioners. The funds could get into serious difficulty if, as I suspect, that is a possibility. However, I am not absolutely sure that it is a possibility. We shall wish to explore that further in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) raised the question whether clause 43, which sets out the principles and basis of the pay-as-you-go scheme, together with the later clauses which give flesh to it, will provide for all deficiencies to be made up, so that if any deficiencies occur in the future the Minister will be obliged to make them up. It is not clear to me, from my reading of the Bill and from what we have heard so far, whether the Minister will have an obligation to meet all of the present shortfall as years go by, if I may put it that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody accepts that there is a shortfall in funding which will have to be made up. But the money to make it up will have to be paid out over years to come only in fairly small sums—from the Treasury's point of view, at any rate, which is no doubt why the system appeals to the Government. But I am not sure whether it is accepted that the make-up through pay-as-you-go must completely cover the shortfall that is acknowledged to exist at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, a great deal of actuarial messing about will take place with these funds, not only now but in the future. I wonder whether other shortfalls may arise and whether the Minister will be obliged to make those up on a pay-as-you-go basis as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is developing a great argument. Perhaps he will cast his mind back to the original British Railways wages grades pension fund. The British Railways superannua-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1905</span>
tion fund was then set up, with sections 1 and 2. One of the copper-bottomed promises given in order to get people to transfer from the wages grades pension fund to the superannuation fund was that it was Government funded and they could not lose, which indeed was true—until this Bill came along. People who joined the superannuation fund, including myself, were therefore misled, because that copper-bottomed promise will now no longer apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. I hope that the Minister will do likewise, although, again, he may need time. I do not intend to decry the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary, but I think that, save for the efficiency of the briefing that they receive, they generally find themselves as much at sea in relation to these pensions provisions as we do. I am happy to withdraw that comment if they feel insulted. I was going to say that in the circumstances I would therefore understand if they wished to have time to reflect upon points that have been raised, particularly these general points of principle emanating from our consideration of clause 43.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise what I have tried, rather haltingly, to make clear, railway pensioners are very concerned that the change from funding to pay-as-you-go may be damaging to them. One reason for that concern—and this is not a party point—is that they do not trust Governments of any political complexion who are funding their pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis not to try to snatch some of them back or not pay them when times are difficult. A funded system commends itself to them because, in a sense, it is a bird in the hand. Even if the Government had built up the funds, I could envisage the Treasury raiding them if it felt that that was absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, to raid a pension fund in that way would possibly raise a bigger issue of principle than simply not paying out the money on a pay-as-you-go system. Whatever the relative merits in principle of the two systems, that is their feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that a pay-as-you-go system is indeed appropriate in many ways for nationalised industries and for the public sector generally. But that is not what we shall have in British Rail in any case. We shall have what is basically a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1906</span>
funded pension scheme running currently, with a Government make-up of shortfall on the funding. So it will not actually be a pay-as-you-go scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, whilst there may be merits in a pay-as-you-go system, pensioners who have been inveigled into joining superannuation schemes and shifting from one to another, and who have seen a substantial number of statutory changes both in the nature of their employers' organisation and in the way in which their pensions are funded, have a reasonable concern that the move from funding to pay-as-you-go may be damaging to them—on the basis that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush particularly when the bush has not even been planted yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that in dealing with this matter the Minister will appreciate that people's pensions are a matter of great concern to them, and that they, too, feel at a loss in trying to understand the details. In the end, all that they know—and even that is difficult to judge—is whether they are getting a good deal or a raw deal. There is a clear feeling, which has not been stimulated artificially by outside interference from trouble makers, militants, Members of Parliament or the like, and a significant fear throughout the staff of British Rail, that the changes may work to their disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is up to the Minister to prove that the system that he establishes will not work to the disadvantage of those people. The only way that he can do that is by ensuring that it does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have been no amendments to clause 43, so our main debate is on the principle. There is a fundamental difference of interpretation between the two sides of the Committee as to the effects of the clause and of the Bill as a whole with regard to historic pensions in British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister clearly believes—we accept that he believes it—that the rights of the pensioners are guaranteed under his scheme, and that the fears expressed by the Opposition and by many organisations outside the Committee are groundless. In other words, although we are talking about 20 or 30 years, he believes that his scheme will still guarantee the pensioners a similar system of security similar to that which they believe is embodied in the pensions provisions at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1907</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), made the point that people certainly believe that at present. They are perhaps encouraged to take employment with British Rail because of the pensions. My hon. Friend has handed me a document published at the time that makes clear to the employees that they should become members of a modern superannuation scheme designed to provide greater security for members and their families before and after retirement, and so on, in the same vein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is sufficient to show that British Rail was encouraged to cite pensions as one of the advantages to attract people into the industry. If there is now the threat that employees will be denied that security, clearly they will feel let down by the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister opened the debate on the clause, he seemed to be of the opinion that such fears were groundless. But we challenge that view. We shall oppose it both by argument and with our votes. Undeniably the Bill represents fundamental changes; we have debated that before. Undeniably this clause, along with certain other clauses, reflects fundamental changes in the financing of pension obligations. Those changes are matters for disagreement not only between the two sides of the Committee but—to judge by the advice and evidence that we receive—between the Government and the trustees, the Government and the companies and the Government and the trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of that has altered, as we saw from the Minister's reference to his meeting a week ago with the various bodies responsible for the pension funds. He confirmed that the disagreements expressed earlier in letters to members of the Committee were repeated to him at that meeting. It is clear, then, that the objections expressed by the Opposition in the Committee do not result only from political differences with the Government. Of course, we have political arguments as well, but many disagreements revolve around whether the Minister's judgment is incorrect when he says that present pensioners will be guaranteed the same rights as they feel they have under the present system for funding the historical rail-based pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is introducing a fundamental change on top of a previous fun-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1908</span>
damental change. The present pension system really dates back to 1974. The funding of the obligations is embodied in the 1974 Act. We have heard about the Public Accounts Committee's attitude as to whether it is necessary to fund the pension schemes of nationalised concerns if one assumes that the Government will always step in to meet the obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is interesting to note that the Labour Government in 1974 were of the opinion that the view that one did not have to fund the pension obligations of nationalised industries was leading to increasing financial difficulties for British Rail. It was envisaged that in coming years more and more of the moneys given to British Rail for operating the industry would have to be devoted to meeting pension requirements. That was why a major reorganisation of the financing took place in 1974. The Labour Government recognised that there had been a build-up of liabilities and that a vast unfunded liability was facing British Rail as a nationalised industry. Governments have gained since then by not having had to contribute to a pension fund over the intervening period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Accounts Committee and other Committees of this House held the view, which has also been expressed in legislation, that nationalised industries should have commercial objectives, should compete with other commercial firms and should face commercial obligations. In those circumstances the last Administration took the view that the best way was to fund their pension systems, as opposed to those of civil servants, who work for an organisation that will remain. I think that we can presume that Governments will still be here even if businesses disappear. There will always be civil servants. One can understand that point. One can see the reason for funding the pay-as-you-go principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That conclusion which was accepted at the time, is now to be overturned. The present system, by which the liabilities of the pension funds were to be assessed and then financed, is now to be changed. The assessment at that time was £1,000 million—a tremendous amount of money. I believe that the latest estimate, made in 1979, was that the liabilities stood at about £925 million. That is an awful lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we realise that, we get some indication of the attraction of the proposed scheme for the present Govern-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1909</span>
ment. That represents another great difference of attitude towards public expenditure between the Government and the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather unfortunate for British Rail that another Government came to power before the autumn of this year, when the final assessment would have been established. The new Government informed British Rail and the pension authorities that a different principle would apply. No doubt can remain that it is indeed a different principle. However, there may appear to be a certain similarity between the Labour Government and the present Government in their view of what would happen over a period of time. In 1981 the Government will make their assessment of the correct proportion of contribution and settle on that principle. After that the pension authorities will be on their own which causes them some concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that under the present scheme the Labour Government would have applied the same principle from 1986. The great difference is that a massive amount of capital would by then have been put into the pension schemes. An awful lot of investment and interest would have come from that money and would have allowed the increasing liabilities to be funded. Any doubts as to what was to happen in 1986 would have been allayed by the fact that by then there would have been almost 10 years of building up massive capital assets. That would have made an essential difference to feelings of security about pension funds being financed in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the two parties approach the funding of historical rail-based pension obligations on entirely different principles. Another interesting difference between ourselves and the Government on that subject relates to the final stage assessment that is to take place in the autumn of 1979. That will presumably be similar to the judgment that the Minister will make in 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to the pension authorities, the Labour Government gave assurances to them and to the unions that discussions would take place between the Government and the board. That letter, which was written in 1977, stated that the Government's intention was—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the basis for that valuation will be freely agreed by all the parties involved—the Government, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1910</span>
Board and the funds—on the basis of the actuarial advice available to them."</p></blockquote>
That is distinctly and fundamentally different from the position under the Bill. That difference further adds to the insecurity felt by those involved in pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting aspect of Fowler's law—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Foul law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we feel that it is a foul law from Fowler. Fowler's law is clearly different from ours. The Minister seems to feel that he can give the same assurances as they had before to those in pension funds without paying the £1,000 million. That is a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing—or rather "Watch the left hand; don't worry about the right hand." It is another conjuring trick, such as those referred to by my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can do that now it amazes me that the great minds of the Treasury did not come up with that idea for saving £1,000 million straight away, instead of endorsing the suggestions of the Public Accounts Committee. It is not a new principle. Hybrids between pay-as-you-go systems and funded schemes have been known to a number of authorities and have been a constant source of debate. I understand that the Wilson committee is looking at the principles embodied in such schemes. So it is not a new principle. It has been looked at before. Yet suddenly the Government say "Don't worry. We have found a new formula. We shall save £1,000 million but you will still have the same assurances."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why all the great minds at the Treasury did not think of that formula before. The truth is that it does not give a guarantee. "You gets what you pays for" is the same principle. The £1,000 million that is being given in this way was allowed for in the 1974 Act, and guarantees that pensioners have far greater security for their pensions in the next 20 years, which is when the bulk of those pensioners will claim the benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be dispute between us in Committee, but it is only in Committee because every organisation outside seems to agree with out view. I pray in aid that famous publication 
	<i>The Economist.</i> The issue of 24 November 1979 states
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1911</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Britain's new transport bill is an unlikely place to look for an event of significance for the financial market. Yet it contains details—expressed in such appalling gobbledegook as to be almost incomprehensible—of a move to stop British Rail's pension schemes from funding members' benefits in full. This step towards a partial pay-as-you-go system in the nationalised industries seems to imply that the government does not regard the principle of pensions funding as sacrosanct. Is this the thin end of the wedge?"</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the concern over insecurity is not only for British Rail's pensions but for those other nationalised industries which agreed the principle of funding that the Labour Government brought in under the 1974 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a belief that it is more than the thin end of the wedge. It is a way of getting out of reducing the public sector borrowing requirement. It is connected with the Government's economic policies. But it is not at the Government's expense; it is at the expense of the concern the worry and the liabilities of the pension funds and those who are dependent upon them. 
	<i>The Economist</i> could hardly be described as a Labour publication, but it usually has more than an inkling about the financial common sense that is required in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's system is, unfortunately, somewhere between the two. If he was giving a pay-as-you-go system, which could be argued as being beneficial for a number of nationalised industries and public sector departments or civil servants, that would be fair. There would be no complaints from the pensions industry, because the liabilities would be met as they arose. The other way is to fund completely, as the Labour Government did in 1974, and everyone would be satisfied. But no, the middle way has now been found. It is a combination of pay-as-you-go and a certain amount of funding, depending on what the assets are at a given time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we do know is that the assets are less than the liabilities. All the Minister tells us is that he will make an estimate of what the difference between the asset value and the liabilities will be. He then makes not only a continuing judgment, as he would for the pay-as-you-go system, but makes it for a date in 1981, and that will be the last for 20 years. It is that judgment that is causing considerable concern in the industry. No one has made an estimate for the next five years, let alone 20 years. The Minister is expected
	<span class='label label-info column'>1912</span>
to make a judgment about inflation, and about the rate of investment, depending on what happens to that, and put them all together in one big sum for 1981. That is the cause for concern, because no one has made such a judgment before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Minister accepts that the judgment might be wrong, it also in no way allows for a check to be made for the quite human mistake that might be made. People in pensions schemes cannot accept the Government's hope, desire and will, without a commitment in the Bill, to act if their judgment proves wrong. That is the cause of the concern, and the major difference between our approach in 1974 and the Government's approach in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote again 
	<i>The Economist</i> of January this year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The snag is that the inherited liabilities, the bulk of which run for around 20 years, could be worth anything between £1 billion and £2 billion, depending on the actuarial assumptions. The relative contributions of government and railmen hinge on the valuation which will be made by the end of 1981 and there is no provision for a review if the sums prove wrong.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The one safe assumption is that the valuation will be moonshine, since it involves forecasting pay and price inflation for the next 20 years."</p></blockquote>
If it is considered to be moonshine it will be disastrous for the pension funds. If inflation gets out of hand—it is now twice what it was when the Government came to power—liabilities will increase. They will certainly increase if the rate of investment is lower than the rate of inflation. That is clearly the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present system, liabilities will increase, and, because there is no guarantee in the Bill that the Government will step in to meet a shortfall in those liabilities, the shortfall could, as estimated in 
	<i>The Economist,</i> be as much as £100 million to £200 million. That, set against British Rail's borrowing requirement and against public sector cuts in the coming 10 to 20 years, will have disastrous consequences for British Rail's pensions funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As soon as the Minister publishes his forecast or makes clear his estimate of how much of the funded portion can be met by the fund, many people who are interested in knowning the Government's estimate of the rate of inflation for the future will focus attention on it. The Minister's estimate will come under the public spotlight. He will be pressed by members of the Cabinet to keep that esti-

	<span class='label label-info column'>1913</span>
mate of inflation as low as possible, and that would be against the interests of people in the pension schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an excellent point, which was made also by 
	<i>The Economist.</i> It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So the decisions on which actuarial assumptions are used will be passed on to the Minister, Mr. Fowler, who will find his name linked to a politically sensitive forecast that will almost certainly be widely publicised."</p></blockquote>
We have the greatest difficulty in getting decisions from Ministers about what they base their inflation forecasts on and what inflation rate they use. Now we are to have a forecast of inflation for the next 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe that there will be ever-increasing liabilities for pensions. The Minister made the point that the Public Accounts Committee criticised the principle embodied in the Railways Act 1974, which dealt with liabilities and the funding of historic rail-based pensions. It said that the funding approach was excessively costly. It is good to hear that a Minister is taking account of the opinions of these Committees. I am a great believer in the Committees having much more influence on events. It is good to hear the Minister saying that he has taken this on board and acted promptly, stating that because the Public Accounts Committee has acted—although he did not say it exactly like that—he is prepared to make a judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister did not make clear, however, when talking of the criticisms made by the Public Accounts Committee, was that a letter from the Department of Transport to the Board of British Rail dated 7th December 1977 stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if policy were to be changed in the light of this review one must, I think, assume that this would be done in such a way as to leave the position of members and pensioners of the funds as secure as it is now, in other words if a change were made the security which is effected by full funding would be replaced by some other equally effective security for the membership."</p></blockquote>
The basis of our argument—and the PAC is also concerned about this—is that if the system is changed fundamentally, we must be sure that we make the security equally applicable to the people who will receive the pensions. That is the reason for the PAC's concern. We have heard evidence
	<span class='label label-info column'>1914</span>
from all the organisations that in their opinion it does not in any way guarantee the same security. That is the basis of the disagreement between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the PAC's consideration must take into account its other qualification. The PAC was critical of that sort of approach, but invited the Treasury to make an assessment of the matter. It is interesting to read the Ministry of Transport and Treasury notes on their assessment of the various provisions and how to deal with them. We await the report of the Wilson committee, which is dealing with the same principle. The Minister is jumping in well ahead of the judgments that may come from those authorities. He is quite entitled to do that. I do not condemn him for it, but it means that this is a matter of present contention and he cannot pray in aid the Public Accounts Committee as the reason for this unless he is to guarantee to the same people the security they previously had under full funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister wanted to do that he could give those people pay-as-you-go and let the Government face the reality of funding that from year to year, as is done with the financing of a number of their pension arrangements. But the Government choose to take the other way, which I believe has more to do with public expenditure. I presume that is attractive because it is a less painful option for the Ministry than making cuts in other areas, such as other Departments have seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can understand the attraction for the Minister of making his contribution to public spending cuts without slashing road and rail in a way that perhaps would have been more savage had he not found this way. But the reality is that what he has saved has put the concern, worry and liability on to another body—the ordinary people who enjoy the pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made clear that all the other authorities agree with our assessment of the position. All that they have asked of the Minister is some assurance by his putting into his scheme the opportunity for a guarantee that if his judgment were wrong the Government would meet that obligation. If the Minister's judgment is wrong and British Rail cannot get much money from the Government for its investment programme, it will presumably have to fund that from its own resources and will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1915</span>
still be asking the Government for more money. Theoretically, BR could be knocking on the Government's door and not receiving more money if the Minister contemplates refusing to assist. In that case it will be the pensions that will have to carry that liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading some of the criticisms of the Government's proposals, I find it interesting to note that the judgment on high and low inflation is that if there is high inflation the liabilities and the problems of funding will grow, but that if inflation is low—which we assume is the Government's intention—there will be a surplus on the fund, depending on the assets already there. If there is a surplus, will not the PAC be concerned that the pension fund is being given too much money? Will not it be criticising the Government for having made an agreement without allowing for the clawback that was in the Labour Party's proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government's 1974 Act had arrangements for a clawback in case we had the qualifications wrong. This Government may get it wrong. The Government will presume that their judgment will be on the right side and that the liabilities will fall on British Rail and not on the Government. But if matters went the way that the Government believe they will, and inflation fell, the fund would make a profit. The fund would be making more profits from taxpayers' money than was intended. Should not there have been a clause in the Bill to claw back that money? The Minister refuses that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a reasonable argument has been put forward by the various bodies dealing with this matter. The clause is fundamentally different from what we have proposed. It introduces greater insecurity for those in the pension schemes who are least able to carry the burden, and we will undoubtedly oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with care to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), whose speech was made with sincerity and passion. However, many of his arguments can be used against the 1974 Act, which he sought to put up as the example of all time. If he believes that the assessment of the rate of inflation is crucial, that would have been required under the 1974 Act and under the once-and-for-all assessment that would have been made at the end of last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1916</span>
Not only has the hon. Gentleman got matters slightly wrong, but 
	<i>The Economist</i> has got its article wrong. The crucial question for the pension scheme is not so much the future rate of inflation but, the real rate of return. The future rate of inflation is simply one element that has to be taken into account. By no means is it the sole or crucial element when it comes to making an assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I said there would be a time when the Government, whether Conservative or Labour, would say "No more." If the assessment is wrong the liability will be on the British taxpayer. The differences is that £1,000 million was being put into a fund in its early stages, which would be able to restore a great deal of the earnings at this stage. That is far different from the present proposal, which has no new income to raise from investment return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is obviously the difference between the two arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to turn to the once-and-for-all arrangement in a moment. I think that it is important to try to understand not only the Bill and what the Government seek to achieve, but the concern of some of the bodies which have been making their views known. That is their obvious right, and we wish to have as much advice and consultation as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern of some of the pension fund managers. It is true to say that the predominant concern has come from that quarter, as opposed to the public. But we are arguing about the details, the arrangements and the assessment. They are important and fundamental, and we shall be dealing with these matters in the later clauses of the Bill, but I do not believe that there are many people outside this House who say that the pay-as-you-go system that we propose cannot work or who say "What you propose is totally impracticable and wrong." Perhaps it is being said by some, but that is not a fair or objective assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) started with a fair statement of the difference between the pay-as-you-go system and the funded system. The hon. Gentleman believes that we should continue the funded system and that there is no alternative to voting against the clause. Since there is a fundamental change, there can be no avoid-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1917</span>
ing that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) made the point that the Bill sought to save money inside the transport programme. I have never made the slightest secret that that is what we seek to achieve—that is one of our main purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remind the Committee of the sort of taxpayers' contribution that we are talking about—a further £1,200 million which would have stood to be paid under the funding orders so far made. Therefore, hon. Gentlemen may believe that the policy is right or wrong, but there are substantial sums at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central said that compared with 1974 I was basically the sole arbitrator. There is nothing in the 1974 Act which requires the British Railways Board and the funds to agree. That is a simply misconception of the legislation. I make no complaint about what the hon. Gentleman said, but he has been given advice that is wrong. The Act provided, as does the Bill, for the Minister to decide how much funding debt would be calculated. The previous Government intended to consult and seek to reach agreement, and so do we. Clearly, I cannot undertake to reach agreement, and nothing has been said since to change that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the chairman of the management committee who came to see me, I understood the reasons for that visit. I should like to remind the Committee of precisely what we are talking about. Under the Bill, support payments will be made by the Government only as and when the pensions to which they correspond are paid to the pensioners concerned. The Minister is, therefore, placed under an obligation to meet the emerging costs corresponding to the historic obligations which cannot be met from the assets of the pension schemes concerned
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the enactment of the Bill an actuarial assessment will be made of each scheme in respect of which there are historic obligations. From this assessment will be calculated the unfunded proportion appropriate to that scheme—the proportion which the value of the liabilities of the scheme, corresponding to the historic obligations less the value of the associated assets of the scheme, bears to the value of the liabilities, The Minister will
	<span class='label label-info column'>1918</span>
then be required to pay over to the scheme each year sums equal to the unfunded proportion of the scheme's total outgoing on pensions corresponding to the historic obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the visit of Mr. Kentridge and the meeting to which the hon. Gentleman referred. During that meeting Mr. Kentridge and his colleagues were understandably concerned that the principle of pay-as-you-go was being applied to only a proportion of the liabilities of the scheme, and that that proportion would be estimated once and for all. Their basic case was that it was virtually certain that the actuarial assumption used in determining the proportion would be made out of date by events. It would mean that if the unfunded proportion was too high the Government might be criticised for allowing excessive public expenditure, or that if it was too low there was the risk of hardship for the pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to meet that concern as far as possible. It will be difficult to do so by having a regular review, as suggested by Mr. Kentridge and his colleagues. What I would undoubtedly be prepared to do, and want to do in any event, is to have consultations with the board and the persons administering the scheme concerned before making a formal determination of the unfunded proportion of a British Rail scheme. I would likewise consult the corporation and the persons administering the scheme before making a formal determination of the unfunded proportion for an NFC scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, therefore, prepared to write into the legislation a requirement that I should consult. I cannot write in a requirement that I should have regular reviews over the years. I hope I have made that clear. It is intended to be a helpful suggestion. It would not be right to hurry the drafting of that requirement during the Committee stage, but it can be dealt with on Report after taking advice on the best form of drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have sought to make that matter clear. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for raising the point, but it is the first eventuality that I would want to cover. The principle is that we are aiming so far as possible for the same position as existed under the 1974 Act. The once-and-for-all settlement was an arrangement under that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand that that may not meet all the Opposition's fears and fundamental objections to the arrangement. There will be division between us on that. But I hope that they will feel that at least it is a useful step in the right direction for us to seek to do something of this sort and to try to reach as much common agreement and consent as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a long and interesting debate. I believe that we have covered all the arguments of principle. There are some extremely important arguments of detail to come. Indeed, the importance of the provision is in the detail, on which it stands or falls. I look forward to our future debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the beginning of this discussion, we are proposing a system that is basically a change in the method of supporting the obligation that would have been funded. But it is not intended to be a change in the principle, and we are certainly not proposing a reduction in the effective support that is being provided. Certainly, if there is anything that I can do to make pensioners feel more secure I shall be happy to consider any reasonable proposals. With those words, I hope that the Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are moving towards a Division on the clause. I intervene only in the hope of making two points clear. First, my hon. Friends and I will not vote against the clause to show that we are in favour of funding and against pay-as-you-go. That is not our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might have taken a different attitude to the clause had the Minister called in those responsible for running the pension funds, drawn their attention to what
	<span class='label label-info column'>1920</span>
the Public Accounts Committee had said, and told them "The Government want to save on immediate expenditure. We propose that, instead of covering your historic obligations by funding arrangements, that will be done entirely by pay-as-you-go from now on", and agreed with them on the appropriate contribution and how it should be set out year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be voting against the rigidity of the method laid down in the Bill, and the idea that it is reasonable—or practicable—within a year of its being passed to fix a proportion that will be sound and valid for another 20, 30 or 40 years as between what is already covered by funding and what will in future have to be covered by pay-as-you-go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely take the Minister's point that it is not just the inflation rate that will have to be taken into account in making an assessment of how much of the historic liability on rail pensions can be covered by funding. He is perfectly right to say that the performance of investments in the future will also have a bearing on that. But in that respect the Opposition are very conscious that the trustees of pension funds will not be obtaining any more money from the Government to invest at higher rates if there is a better investment performance. Therefore, whilst we accept that that has a bearing, it does not have so great a bearing as under the provisions of the 1974 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor to be taken into account will be the level of public service pension increases, because part of the funding is to deal with increases in railway historic pensions, which come about as a result of attempting to cover them against inflation to the extent that public service pensions are covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, we believe that it will be virtually impossible for the Minister to get this right. We do not envy him the task of making the estimate. We believe that, however he does it, it is highly unlikely that he will be able to predict the way in which all of those variables will move over the next 20 years. We shall therefore vote against the clause, not because we think that it is wrong for part or even the whole of these historic pension rights to be covered by pay-as-you-go, but because the method chosen is so rigid that it has aroused understandable and entirely justifiable fears on the part of those who have the greatest responsibility to the pensioners concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
