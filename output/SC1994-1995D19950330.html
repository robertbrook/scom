	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having earned the undying gratitude of our colleagues last night by not debating the Ways and Means resolution, we shall do our best to earn the undying gratitude of the Committee today by not wasting any more time than is necessary to ensure adequate discussion of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would delete what could reasonably be termed a catch-all power, which is what the clause gives the Secretary of State. We spent a fair amount of time last week discussing schedule 1 in enormous detail, especially the types of scheme and transfer and the various aspects involved. Clause 2 is a sweeping provision. One could almost ask why one needs the Bill at all when it contains such a provision. We should give the Bill a subtitle and call it the "Atomic Energy Authority Bill: The Secretary of State May Do Whatever He Likes To Facilitate This," and not bother wasting our time with all the other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder why the draftsmen felt it is necessary to include that level of power for the Secretary of State. Given that the Atomic Energy Authority is not prepared to call upon the House for any form of ratification of anything it intends to do in future, perhaps it is necessary for the Secretary of State to have a catch-all power. It is incumbent on the Minister to spend a minute or two telling us what power might be used under the clause, and what action the Secretary of State could envisage taking as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives sweeping powers to the Secretary of State and we have not yet had an answer to the questions that we posed at our previous sitting on the handling and
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
safekeeping of special nuclear materials and on the individuals involved in that process. I hope that this provision was not included in the Bill to cover that, because the Opposition still feel strongly that specific reference must be made in the Bill to those issues. It is not a matter of "may" or of empowering the Secretary of State to deal with nuclear safety and security in relation to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is incumbent on the Secretary of State to come before us with detailed, prescriptive provisions that put a duty on any successor company within the public sector and the private sector to comply with all the regulations that currently apply to those materials within the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Anything less than that would be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister has had time to reply to our questions—it is only two days since our previous sitting, so I shall not press him too hard today. At some stage, however, he must tell us which provisions of previous Acts apply to companies or other groups involved in the handling, distribution and storage of such materials. For example, how does the Official Secrets Act 1911 apply and how will its provisions affect future employees? That is important, as employees may be handling material relevant to national security. Will the employees of successor companies be positively vetted? Will companies have to apply for list X status? Those questions must be answered. It is unacceptable to have a catch-all clause that gives the Secretary of State all the powers that he needs. We cannot be expected to be able to sleep comfortably at night in the knowledge that the Secretary of State has our best interests at heart. That is simply not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What exactly are the powers that the Secretary of State seeks under the clause? The Minister should tell us. Moreover, if the Minister can answer our questions about the handling of special nuclear materials—I admit I have not had the opportunity to read the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of Tuesday's sitting—we should like those answers now. If the Minister would prefer to reply in a letter, will he assure me that he will send a copy of it to other members of the Committee who are interested in his response?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Energy (Mr. Richard Page)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first congratulate the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) on his ingenuity in producing a compendium of requirements encapsulating the whole Bill in a relatively small amendment. I should like to set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our previous sitting, questions were rightly asked about the vetting of staff. I said then that it was difficult for me to respond in detail. As the Committee will appreciate, vetting procedures should remain confidential—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The blinds are being pulled down to protect security! That will stop the cameras from being focused on our windows from across the Thames.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee would not expect me to divulge the details of procedures whereby vetting takes place. As I said, I want to offer the hon. Gentleman some comfort. UKAEA Government division and Atomic Energy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
Authority Technology have agreed arrangements to ensure that all employees of AEA Technology, or of a successor company or companies, who deal with special nuclear material will continue to be vetted in accordance with UK Government standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
UKAEA is at present required, by direction of the Secretary of State under the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954, to apply Government standards of personnel security. That obligation applies equally in relation to employees of AEA Technology, and will continue to apply as long as AEA Technology remains part of UKAEA. When AEA Technology is separated, and eventually privatised, the same personnel security regime will be imposed. All such work on special nuclear materials will be undertaken in facilities owned by UKAEA Government division, under the terms of licences to operate. Government division will make it a condition of all such licences that all employees operating these facilities continue to be appropriately vetted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to send the hon. Gentleman a letter on that matter later today, but as he jumped into a debate on it in Committee, I have responded now. I shall send a copy of that letter to all members of the Committee, so that they have it for the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2(8) is designed to put beyond doubt the ability of the Secretary of State to exercise his powers under the Bill. It is intended to avoid any argument that the transfer to the private sector of any activities carried on by the authority might be inconsistent with the duty placed on the Secretary of State under section 1 of the Atomic Energy Act 1946 to promote and control the development of atomic energy. The provision makes it clear that the Secretary of State is entitled to exercise his powers under the Bill, irrespective of any restriction on that duty. I urge the Committee, therefore, to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minster for his reply, which, as far as it goes, will reassure members of the Committee of the Governments intention to maintain safety standards while the companies that succeed AEA Technology are publicly owned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minster has not, however, answered the question put by his hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Mr. Baptiste) on Tuesday about whether a bar might be placed on the future employment in the United Kingdom and beyond of those people in such companies and in Government division who have access to sensitive material. Will he shed some light on that matter? I do not expect him to give an answer immediately—if he had one, he would have given it by now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is largely technical, and I understand that the Government want to be certain that they will not infringe measures in the 1946 Act. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS AS TO THE AUTHORITY'S POWERS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 3, line 17, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The Authority shall not take any action under this section except with the consent of the Secretary of State.'.</p></blockquote>
The Minister might have hoped that the clause would pass without any attempt to amend it because it is small and relatively insignificant. I am sorry to disappoint him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the clause allows the authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"to do anything which in their opinion is appropriate".</p></blockquote>
That might mean whatever the authority wants it to mean. We are not told what action is considered to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen on other occasions that one of the first things companies do as they prepare for the rigours of the market is to ensure that the salaries paid to those in senior positions are commensurate with the awesome responsibility they exercise when competing in the market in a private, not a public sector company. It has always seemed strange to me that a person can wake up one morning, go to work and do exactly the same job he has done for 25 years, but suddenly require three times as much money to perform his duties adequately. If he is not given the money, he will immediately be poached by another organisation and given an even larger salary, while the original company is left to suffer. Health trusts are another excellent illustration of that strange phenomenon. A person who has worked in the national health service, as part of a unified structure, suddenly finds it a great difficulty to carry out the same job without a greater level of reward when he moves to a health trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What other aspects of such behaviour could be involved? We have read a great deal recently about share options schemes. We do not want to pre-empt any later discussion about employee-management buy-outs, although that is the arrangement that we would favour if the organisation must be sold off. Employee-management buy-outs are one thing, the awarding of share options to a favoured few quite another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Secretary of State to retain powers in this instance. In the previous debate, we discussed the Secretary of State's demand that he be allowed to do anything to facilitate the process. All that we ask is that he underline that by taking exactly the same power in this instance so that if there is any sign of abuse of the powers being granted to the authority, the Secretary of State can take appropriate action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
Member for Kirkcaldy. We have had enough examples of late, and I am sure that those examples go back a considerable time too, of Ministers standing up and saying, whatever sector of commerce is being discussed, "This is outside our jurisdiction. We deplore this action but there is absolutely nothing that we can do about it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tries to avoid the "not me, guv" syndrome that has dominated the Government during the past few years. If the Government accept the amendment, they will be unable to stand up in the future and say that they do not have the power over or the responsibility for a specific issue. If they do not accept the amendment, they are deliberately putting themselves in a position that enables them to make those excuses in the future. People will be under no doubt about why the Government are not prepared to retain those powers. It would be in the public interest for the Secretary of State to retain the powers that the amendment would provide and I see no reason why he should not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What an inauspicious start. I was not referring to you, Mr. Hill, great and mighty sir. I am referring to the Government: how daft can they get?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the wording of the clause, which discusses the authority's power
	<br><blockquote><p>"to do anything which in their opinion is appropriate".</p></blockquote>
That is trammelled by the two issues that the power aims to facilitate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any transfer effected or proposed to be effected under section 1"</p></blockquote>
and:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the disposal of securities of a successor company."</p></blockquote>
When the words "do anything" are used, especially nowadays when it seems that anything goes, we might expect that the people—we know not who they will be—to whom the Government intend to dispose of this important asset will do anything. They will do anything, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy suggested, to line their pockets, improve their share options—anything, in fact, to get their snouts in the trough as another privatisation proceeds along unfortunately familiar lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It gives no comfort to the Committee that the clause gives certain powers under subsections (a) and (b) because
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
much could be achieved as result. For example, subsection (a) refers to "any transfer", which again broadens the definition. The terms of the Bill must be deprecated because they are clear about nothing. The Bill attempts to confine itself to nothing, but gives the widest possible powers to those who will run and own the industry. We must have some regard to the successor companies' opinion; for once, they are outside the guidance of the appropriate Secretary of State but under the Bill it is solely their opinion that will count. We can envisage a situation in which there is little opportunity to challenge those opinions. Once someone has been given the right to express an opinion and to do anything on the basis of it in pursuit of the activities covered by the subsections, how on earth does one rein that right back so that it can be challenged?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording is loose—maybe deliberately so, because the Government have been unclear and unhelpful from the very beginning in regard to this privatisation. The Minister may shake his head, but I repeat that the Government have been unclear and unhelpful. We know the background to the privatisation. The Government were forced and hurried into it, being unable to proceed with the privatisation of the Post Office. My hon. Friend the Minister for Kirkcaldy said that it is a very short clause and indeed it is. None the less, it conveys the clear, obvious message that the Government have hurried and scurried into the privatisation without giving proper thought to it. That is why the Bill contains words like "anything", "opinion" and "any transfer".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the people who are scrutinising the proposed legislation, we are entitled, almost as a matter of course, to have clear, precise undertakings from the Minister that he will redefine matters and come back to us with more appropriate, restricted and targeted—to use one of the Government's favourite expressions, although in this instance it is justified—wording. It is not reasonable, given the history and the difficulties of previous privatisations, to expect members of the Committee to support the Clause. In regard to the gas industry, for example, it is clear that the instructions given to the regulator are not appropriate or complete enough for him to do a proper job on behalf of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are again, however, using words that could be construed in any way and used for any purpose. We need and are entitled to clarification, to ensure that the public and, indeed, the Secretary of State, who is expected to take responsibility for anything that might go wrong, can be confident that the Government's powers will have real bite. If the transfer is based on nothing more than the opinion of the successor bodies, that confidence will not exist. The clause should contain real words with real meaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key question is: what is the purpose of AEA as it is now and what will its purpose be after privatisation? A fundamental shift is involved. Given the work that it undertakes for various Government Departments and private sector organisations, its raison d'être has been established over a number of years. It has used the best skills and scientific expertise available to it for the greater
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
interests of the people in the community. After privatisation, the principal responsibility of the directors of the company will be to act in the best interests of the shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy used the example of hospital trusts, and it could be postulated that it might be to the shareholders' advantage if the company were to dispose of large land assets, for example. From time to time one encounters cases in which hospital trusts have acted similarly. In my constituency there is a plot of land that belongs to the health authority. Common sense would dictate that, if possible, that land could be handed over to the Housing Corporation or the local authority for the development of much needed low-cost housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, one might seek to solve Newbury's housing problems. I have consulted the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) for some accurate figures, and he told me that there are about 800 families in urgent need in his area. If the local councils in their wisdom—or lack of it—suddenly decided that Harwell could be redeveloped as a large housing estate, it might be very much in the shareholders' interest to scrap some important facility on the site and develop a housing complex there. It seems a wonderful idea: Newbury's housing problems would be solved overnight and the shareholders would romp home with large sums of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be robbing Peter to pay Paul. It would solve one problem, but would not be in the best interests of the nation as a whole. The Minister might argue that, as happened with Amersham International, the company should continue to contribute in a positive way to the country's science base, but the Bill should include a simple power to ensure that the wild excesses of previous privatisations—for example, the preoccupation of Rover and British Aerospace with land transactions at the expense of manufacture of vehicles or of aerospace components, and the activities of the health trusts—do not occur. As my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) said, wild excesses have also been noted in the pay and perks offered to directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend is right to note, the land may be used for any purpose. In my constituency, a grant-maintained school has attempted to slice off a piece of its playing field and offer it to developers in an attempt to maximise its income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is just one example of many. To put it in perspective, that is not happening only in grant-maintained schools, but across the country. The purpose of the allocation of land by central and local government to various authorities is being diverted because there is insufficient control by central and local government over the use of such land. That is an important point. Against that background, how can we maximise the continued science and engineering effort of the company in the Government's proposed structures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
We will assist the future company by making it clear that such powers would be used in such circumstances as the irrational disposal of land or property, or the excessive use of boardroom powers to increase directors' salaries and perks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I respond to the debate, I shall take up some of the comments of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman began with a marvellous tour d'horizon and ended by solving Newbury's housing problem. I must congratulate him on that, but I got the feeling that as he developed his argument, he realised he was getting further and further into trouble, although he managed to squeak through at the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must draw several points to the hon. Gentleman's attention. First, clause 3 deals with AEA, not AEA Technology. There is no intention of privatising AEA, a the hon. Gentleman knows. Secondly, when it is privatised, AEA Technology will be remarkably short of property and buildings. It will operate mainly on licences on AEA sites. All the hon. Gentleman's wonderful scenarios, therefore, do not stack up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had eight years' experience serving on the Public Accounts Select Committee and can say, in the light of that, that we have included clawback details into many similar arrangements. If a property is sold out of a company that has moved into the private sector, and that company then disposes of land for purposes other than those mentioned in the transfer, the Treasury will receive a proportion of the extra sum that was made from the sale of that property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 includes paving powers and is in the Bill because the authority, as a statutory corporation, can act lawfully only within the limits of the powers that Parliament has conferred on it. Like most statutory corporations, the authority has no power at present to dispose of any part of its business that carries out activities that are part of its statutory functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without clause 3, there would be doubt as to whether the authority was within its powers when it carried out the activities necessary to prepare and to effect the privatisation of AEA Technology. I appreciate that Opposition Members might want to restrain the enthusiasm of AEA Technology to be privatised, but I want to make it clear that clause 3 does not imply that the authority could privatise itself without the consent of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to reply to comments that were made about salaries and potential excesses. I have to agree with Opposition Members that some of the results of current share option schemes are excessive. I think, however, that those schemes were struck in good faith at the beginning and that it was not realised how much slack and inefficiency existed in the various companies being privatised. Nobody expected them to do as well as they have done. That is my personal view, but I accept that many people are worried about current share options.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is honourable of the Minister to say that for the world to hear. People will also be able to read his comments in 
	<i>Hansard.</i> For the sake of argument, we can agree with the Minister's analysis that we could not have known how well privatised companies would do. However, we now know what can happen. Is not it therefore incumbent on the Minister to ensure that safeguards against such a recurrence are included in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, although accepting that problems with share options developed in the past, argued that there could only be one possible reason for such problems—undue slack in public sector companies that subsequently generated higher profits than foreseen and therefore higher returns on share options. There are, however, a myriad of circumstances where share options can be abused by people setting of targets from which they will subsequently gain. The running of a company can also be distorted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A director may know that at some time in the future he or she—it is usually a he—will gain massively from the release of a time-set share option. That can affect the whole future of the company, which could be directed not at securing long-term benefits for the industry but at releasing profits at a time suited to an individual. Has not that happened in numerous circumstances in the past? Planning has been distorted by the release of share option values.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be difficult for the Minister to resist that line of argument, but he would be well advised to do so: otherwise, we will have a general debate on privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will accept your guidance, Mr. Hill, and resist going down that path. It is right, however, for me to deal with the issue of salaries and remuneration for the board of AEA Technology. We should all accept that it, together with many other companies, will operate in an increasingly competitive market. Boardroom remuneration will be part of that context: the company will want to attract the right people and to win business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form of sale of AEA Technology, which has yet to be decided, will determine who takes decisions on board room pay. Assuming that AEA Technology is offered for sale as a Company Act 1989 company—not part of trade sale—the Government will ensure that, at the point of sale, mechanisms are in place for disclosing and controlling boardroom pay and related matters, reflecting best practice. I hope that Opposition Members will take some comfort from that. We are awaiting the Greenbury committee report, which will be of considerable interest throughout the House when it is published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2, as we have discussed, makes it clear that
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
transfer schemes will have no legal effect until they have been approved by the Secretary of State and the Treasury. Clause 7(2), which we have yet to discuss, prevents the authority from disposing of any shares in a successor company except with the consent of the Secretary of State and the Treasury. Thus the Bill already provides adequate controls over what the authority can and cannot do on its own account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be to require the Secretary of State's consent for every act taken by the authority under the clause, however minor. That would mean an unnecessary and probably unworkable degree of day-to-day control over the activities of the authority as it prepares for privatisation, and I know that that is not the intention of the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 3, leave out lines 34 and 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any sums received by the Secretary of State in pursuance of an agreement under this section shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that the Minister will not be able to accommodate us on this amendment, nor would I seriously expect him to. Were our positions reversed, I am sure that I would take the same view. It is germane to a discussion on an organisation that spends more on research and development than any other part—I use the term loosely— of the Department of Trade and Industry that we ask ourselves what will be done with the money that accrues from the sale. Where does the profit from AEA's activities go at present? Does it go to the DTI or to the Consolidated Fund? I suspect that it goes to the DTI, although I am not sure: it is not easy to work out how Government accounting practices work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might argue with some justification that as publicly owned companies are part of a Department's responsibility, it would be in the Department's interests, were it able to keep the proceeds of their activities, to maximise the profitable activities of such companies to add to its own activities. For the DTI that is more than simply a desirable option; it is a necessity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
The direction in which DTI spending on research and development has headed in the past 15 years is uniformly down. Each successive year sees the Department spending less and less on research-orientated activities. I recall the stirring phrase from the latest publication on the Department's spending plans. It referred to the abandonment of the advanced technology programme, which showed that the Department was no longer taking an interest in research of this nature and was instead going to concentrate on other activities. The Opposition believe that the DTI has a legitimate role in promoting and extending research activities, one which is all the more germane in view of the publication in the past few days of the first reports of the foresight panels. The AEA is by no means one of the key spending areas of the foresight area, but the reports suggest that the Government should increase their support for research and development. After all, the Government, in the person of the President of the Board of Trade, have said that they would support further spending on near-market research. He said that it was a mistake for the Government to withdraw support for near-market research, as they did about 10 years ago with disastrous consequences for some of our research institutes, as many hon. Members know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face a dilemma. The Government would like to spend more money on near-market research, while the Department of Trade and Industry would like to spend less, as it does every year. How can those conflicting views be reconciled? What is the real message from the DTI? The Department says that it has to spend money on research and development. Using the proceeds from a sale such as is proposed in the Bill to increase spending on research and development would be a neat way for the Department to show that it is committed to increasing such spending. Stealing money from the basic research budget—although I use the word "stealing" in its widest sense—to pay for near-market research is no way to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman, but he is being disingenuous in arguing that any proceeds of the sale should be used in a Department of Trade and Industry research and development fund. The Government reshaped the face of science by creating a separate Office of Science and Technology. Only three of four weeks ago my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster made an announcement welcomed on both sides of the House about the maintenance of the science budget through the OST.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention. It allows me to refer to 
	<i>Research Fortnight,</i> a publication that I receive regularly. It is relatively new but has gained great respect for the quality of its analysis of research spending. This week's editorial is headed "David's roses"—a reference to the same Chancellor of
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
the Duchy of Lancaster mentioned by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). It stated that in the right hon. Gentleman's garden
	<br><blockquote><p>"the roses are blooming. On the basis of figures for 1993 released by the Central Statistical Office last week, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster says that Government spending on research is up, business spending on R and D is up, and taken as a whole, research spending in Britain is breaking records.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>But is everything really coming up roses. Or does Hunt just have rose-tinted spectacles? In cash terms, Hunt cannot be faulted. But when inflation is taken into account the picture looks very different.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Yes, at £7.1 billion, business spending is up in real terms. But in real terms, government spending on research has fallen every year since 1989. At £3.9 billion it is now £1 billion—and 20 per cent.— less than is was in 1981. And in real terms, Britain as a whole is still spending less on research than it was in 1989."</p></blockquote>
Like the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, I welcome the establishment of the OST. After all, it was Labour party policy before the general election. Like many other policy items, the Government snaffled it—one of their few actions of any benefit. I understand that departments in Conservative central office are scrounging their way through Labour party documents looking for any little tidbits that would help an administration bereft of any idea of progress after 15 years in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That comment is pretty rich, given that the Labour party is pinching Conservative policies across the board. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the United Kingdom's shortfall in research and development comparative to spending by our industrial competitors occurs overwhelmingly in the area of industrial R and D backed by the private sector? The Bill will reinforce the need for R and D in the industrial sector, which is growing so strongly and successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the largest deficit in R and D spending is in the industrial sector. That does not hide the fact that Government spending is lower than that of some of our key competitors. It is also distorted by the very large amount of defence spending attributed to research and development. That spending is largely product development, not true research and development. The Government figure is inflated by that component. I do not mean to imply for a moment that money should not be spent on such development, but it is not classic R and D. That is one reason that the problem exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of Government spending on research and development is falling at a time when demands on the money available for research are rising. Demands within basic research are rising as the sphere of human knowledge expands, and demands for near market research support are rising as the technology foresight programme comes to fruition. What is the purpose of technology foresight, if not to ensure that money is spent where it is needed? The programme must have an output. Thousands of people do not get involved in an exercise to set priorities just so that they can pat each other on the back and go away until the next foresight exercise takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The risk is—and I refer again to 
	<i>Research Fortnight</i>—that money will be taken from the budge for basic science.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
The Opposition believes that basic science should not have to pay for increases in spending on applied science. There must be budget provisions for both.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to help.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give a personal view. There is an attraction in taking such steps. Companies such as AEA Technology can operate perfectly adequately in some areas of industry as a plc within the public sector, but outside Treasury rules. A Department could increase its income through various commercial activities, provided the financial rules that apply to such companies are obeyed, they secure their money from the private sector, and the risk is entirely borne by those who make the investment. I have no personal objection to that. I might not, however, be able to convince my shadow Treasury colleagues of that. I do not suggest that the measure is purely a matter of spite and prejudice on the Government's part. It is part of the mechanism of Government about which many Departments quietly complain, even if they must ostensibly accept the Treasury's domination. We might hope that the Chancellor's forecast reduction by one third of the number of employees at the Treasury affects the third that interferes in the good work of other Departments. The governance of the country would be better for that.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to respond to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham and to ask the Minister a question. One has to go back well beyond 1970 to answer the hon. Lady's question because, as I understand the Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1981, all funding issues lead us to the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954. The 1981 Act says that the authority's revenue shall be applied as directed by the Secretary of State with the Treasury's approval. That is not unusual. We have tabled a couple of minor amendments that would change, for example, "those revenues" to "those sums", because the money would not be a revenue sum but the proceeds of a sale. The 1981 Act refers to expenses incurred by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
Secretary of State in selling off the then Radiochemical Centre Ltd, to which the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham referred by its current name of Amersham International.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what has changed in the interim? That is a genuine question, because it appears that the Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1981 hypothecated income sums received by the Secretary of State for his use, whereas it seems that under the Bill, they will go straight into the Consolidated Fund. Is there a technical reason for that change, or is it simply that the Treasury now has more clout over the Department of Trade and Industry than it did? It would be helpful for the Minister to explain why practices that seemed acceptable and—so far as I can tell from the debates on that section in 1981—uncontroversial, have changed in the interim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy painted a rosy picture of money flowing out of AEA and AEA Technology into our grasping Treasury, which did not allow a penny to come back. The actual situation is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA made an overall loss last year and will do so again this year. Whilst AEA Technology will meet its operating profit, that is not the same as the profit that might be made after various restructuring costs. The concerns of the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy are not valid. I would like him to be right—I wish that there had been vast sums. The fact that there were not is one reason we want to put AEA Technology into the private sector. With our proposed new structure, it would make a profit and be able to pay its corporation tax. A glance at the nation's accounts would reveal the considerable sums of money that come into the Treasury from the proceeds, not just a privatisation but from corporation tax which has been paid by private-sector companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said, the moneys that come in are now automatically paid into the Consolidated Fund. I cannot give him a specific reason for the change, as he requested, but in 1981 the Department of Trade and Industry had vast sums of subsidies slopping around and we had to bail out several state industries with taxpayers' money to keep them going. I imagine that any funding that came in then would have been diverted into other sectors of industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything is so much more efficient and effective now. Instead of moneys going out to state activities, industries are in the private sector and the moneys are coming back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You would, Mr. Hill, quite rightly take me to task were I to enter into the interesting debate about research launched by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy. I would welcome such a debate, but my job is to put on the record responses to the amendments, rather than indulge my personal flights of interest.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
stipulating that the proceeds received by the Secretary of State from any agreement made under clause 4 should be paid into the Consolidated Fund. I want to address the broader issue. I assume that the matter of concern to the Opposition is the use that will be made of the proceeds of sale once they have been paid into the Consolidated Fund. Our intention is that an equivalent amount, no greater than the value of the sale proceeds, should be written off from the authority's existing national loans fund debt. Those borrowings are to a large extent a charge on the authority in respect of its previous activities. The proceeds of sale would in effect capitalise the proportion of the debt which would have been met from AEA Technology's revenues. Thus it is right that the proceeds should be offset against the authority's indebtedness to the national loans fund. It remains to be seen what level of proceeds the sale might produce, but there is no good reason at this stage to suppose that proceeds will not be sufficient to extinguish the debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy will recognise that we share a similar aim in the matter, and will agree to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that extinguishing the debt is an important consideration. Next Tuesday, we propose to discuss the future pension liabilities of successor companies to their employees. There might be some interesting discussion on the level of liability that the Government will carry forward for paying the pensions. After all, there is no pension fund to cover those liabilities. It will be interesting to find out how much profit, notional or otherwise, will be made on the sale of AEA Technology once contributions to the pension fund are taken into consideration. However, I suggested at the outset that I did not seriously expect the Minister to accept the deletion of the subsection, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 3, line 44, leave out', as far as practicable,'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is littered with such phrases. Blanket powers are provided "as far as is practicable." No definition is given of "practicable", so what is meant by that? Whose definition will be used? How will the activities of subsidiary companies relate to the AEA? Why should the obligation on a successor company to comply with any directives be any less than the obligation placed on AEA? That, in effect, is what is being said. The Minister can require anything—presumably within the bounds of human taste and decency—of AEA and it must deliver, but no such provision can apparently be made for the activities of
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
successor companies. What is to prevent AEA downloading certain activities to successor companies and then turning round to the Secretary of State when he requests information and telling him to get lost? It could say, "Sorry, this is now the provenance of the successor company and I'm afraid it is no longer practicable for us to give you that information."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whose definition of practicable will be used? The subsection is too vague to be allowed to stand without scrutiny—and without the Minister at least attempting to defend it. It is significant that just a few Government amendments have been tabled; today we will perhaps get to debate what is only the second one. That is a sign either that the Bill has been extraordinarily well-drafted, compared to any other on whose Committees I have had the misfortune to serve—I would like to think that that is the case—or that the Government have not looked too closely at what they are doing and saying and that at some future stage, perhaps on Report or when the Bill goes to the other place, there will be a veritable deluge of Government amendments as they belatedly realise that they have said things that they should not have said or left out things that they should have put in. Does not our debate show the need, again, for specific reference in the Bill to certain powers and duties of, for example, the Government division? The Bill is about the bits of AEA that are left as well as the bits that are going and it is inevitable and logical that there will be changes on both sides after such a split. The Bill, however, concentrates entirely on the sale and disposal of AEA Technology. The Government and their advisers would be well advised to enshrine in the Bill more of the specific activities that remain to be carried out by AEA Government division. In the public sector. That would give both sides far fewer headaches in future. I would like the Minister to set our minds at rest about the use of the phrase "as far as practicable" and to justify its retention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment has real substance. We need to be clear—and that is the continuing theme of our debate—about what powers we are giving or not giving and to ensure that we are practical when assessing the effects of those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The successor bodies will at some stage be governed by the companies Act 1989. It will not be a question of providing, "as far as practicable", information about their accounts or their business—it will be a duty placed on them by the Companies Acts. They will have to produce precise, clear, understandable information in a form set out by that legislation and by the different accounting conventions. In a sense, we are dealing with an application of funds. We are talking about public funds and how they are accounted for. The clause imposes a duty on AEA to assist the Secretary of State to know the source and the application of the funds. That duty will, however, be carried out only "as far as practicable". Such a qualification would not do for a company subject to the Companies Act—the successor body will be acting as a company—and it does not satisfy the Opposition. It ought not to satisfy the Secretary of State, who should feel duty-bound to understand what is happening. The terms of the clause, however, chime with the attitude of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
Government to Members of the House. They tell us that answers to our questions cannot be provided; statistics are not held centrally; that we should go to this agency or that agency—the next steps agency, for example. The clause seems to be just another step down that road and the public are not satisfied with that system of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving out "as far as practicable" would not prevent the authority telling the Secretary of State that some information is exceedingly difficult or disproportionately costly—whatever phrase is used—to extract and put into context. It would be for the Secretary of State to decide whether he needed to know that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who would judge what was "practicable"? Would it be the authority or the Minister and his civil servants? That might cause a clash of opinions. Those problems are stacking up for the future, but we could deal with them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of the information provided should be left to the discretion and opinion of the Secretary of State and that would make the phrase "as far as praticable", which the amendment seeks to remove, superfluous. The Minister could have proceeded on a common-sense, practical basis without being impeded by that phrase so that public accountability could be satisfied and proper negotiations could go on without the threat of someone's opinion being taken as gospel and unchallengeable. I therefore support the amendment; simply deleting the phrase would put the Secretary of State in no worse position, would reinforce his authority and, in the interests of public accountability, that is surely the road that we should be following.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is designed primarily to place the authority under a duty to assist the Secretary of State in the preparation of transfer schemes. The subsection to which the amendment relates places an obligation on the authority to secure an equivalent degree of co-operation from all its subsidiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell Opposition Members that if we could make it stick, I would support the amendment, but life ain't like that. The duty on the authority in relation to subsidiaries is qualified by the phrase "as far as practicable". The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy talked of the downloading of responsibilities; but that puts the time scale of privatisation out of kilter. The aim is to produce satisfactory transfer schemes. In legal terms, there are limits to the control that a shareholder can exercise over a company and it is therefore not right to place the authority under an absolute duty where in theory it might not be able to discharge that duty. That is the reason for the qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practical terms, the duty placed on the authority n relation to its subsidiary is a heavy one and is likely to be entirely adequate to secure the co-operation of those subsidiaries. However, there are a number of organisations with which AEA Technology has a shareholding, in some cases a minority shareholding, and one cannot put a duty on any company to force an organisation with which it has a minority holding to act in line with the amendment. In spirit, I am with the Opposition on this, but, in practice,
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
what they want would be impossible to deliver. I know that they will agree that it would be unreasonable to place the authority under a statutory duty which, in technical terms, it may be unable to fulfil and I therefore urge the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the apparent misdirection of the Clerk when I submitted the amendments. On one amendment I understand that, originally, a Conservative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
Member's name was added to those of my hon. Friends who supported it, but that amendment has since been withdrawn. I am sure that it was my fault, but enough apologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly explain the purpose of the amendments. They cover a number of aspects connected with the disposal of the company. It might have been easier to speak to half of the amendments first and the other half later, but I accept your ruling, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two specific issues are involved. The first is the retention by the Secretary of State of a controlling interest in any successor company and, secondly, the disposal of the company for preference to the employees of the company rather than to any other party. That is the so-called golden share argument, which the Government might decide to retain but implement in a different way. We should be happy to hear from the Government about that. It is clear, however, that they will give no guarantees. Perhaps the Minister will surprise us and we can all get away early if he offers such guarantees, but I fear not. He may express personal sympathy for the amendments, but he will probably disappoint us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA Technology will carry out activities that are vital to our nation—research and decommissioning, research into the operation of nuclear power stations and extension of that research into other areas. In sum, that vast arena of activities should be central to the strategy of any Government. The Government should be committed to prosecuting their strategic research requirements and to ensuring that money is properly spent. So there is every reason to retain a controlling interest in successor companies—at least until they have had a proper chance to find their feet commercially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that the Government retained a majority holding in the company. No time period is specified, as that could cause problems. The amendment is intended to allow us to debate the principle. If the Government accept the principle, it would be for them to bring forward a workable scheme. It has been done with many other companies on their disposal. Some of my hon. Friends have worked closely in such companies and have gained experience from that. Three or four years ago, I gave similar advice when the British Technology Group was privatised, when I argued that the Government should have retained a golden share to ensure that the group's activities continued to work in the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can ensure that the Government retain a controlling interest in AEA Technology, it would allow us the best of both worlds. It would allow competition and not prevent interests in the company from being sold off while at the same time maintaining a safety net. It would reassure people anxious about the dangers of splitting up and selling off the organisation when it has passed from Government control. It would avoid short-termism and the accusation that any acquirer of the company was interested in asset stripping alone. What the Minister said is true—there are precious few physical assets around to be stripped. Perhaps we should be grateful for that. Certain companies—I shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
not name them—may be dissuaded from bidding for the company on the grounds that no quick bucks are to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have still failed to answer other questions about the company passing into foreign ownership. Normally, once a company passes into the private sector that is the end of it. There is no control over whether a foreign buyer can be involved. Foreign buyers, of course, come in many different disguises nowadays, as exemplified by the Trafalgar House bid for Northern Electric. Trafalgar House is wholly owned by a foreign company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth considering the question whether a company operating in key areas of national policy should be allowed to pass into foreign ownership. Adequate provisions exist within the EC's competition laws to allow the Government to state that a certain company is of special significance and should be excluded from foreign ownership as a matter of principle. Yet that does not appear in the Bill. By retaining a controlling interest in the company, the Government could prevent an unhappy state of affairs in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prioritising of employee ownership is important to us and to thousands of workers at AEA Technology. We have put forward sound arguments for not selling the company off. We have to accept, however, that the Government will get their way and at some stage the company will be sold off. It is vital to achieve the best possible result. At least two conditions must be satisfied. First, the company must be retained as a single entity to benefit from the synergy of its activities. The other points that I have made in the past and to which I referred briefly in winding up are also relevant. Secondly, as a matter of preference, the company should be sold to its employees rather than through a flotation or trade sale. That has the support of employees, of the day-to-day management of AEA Technology and of local Members of Parliament from all parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enormous sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I would like him to be specific. Is he advocating that the Government should sell the company under value, to pass it to the employees, or is he arguing that it is the Government's duty to get the best value for the shares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a mistake merely to consider the balance sheet. In any sale involving the lives and careers of thousands of professional people, it is incumbent on us to get the best solution, which is not necessarily the cheapest nor the most financially advantageous. In this case we are selling off a company whose sole value is the aggregate skills of its work force, so the benefits to them from the sale are a perfectly legitimate part of Government strategy. It is not just a matter of making the maximum amount of money. I believe strongly that a lower bid should be accepted if it means that the management and work force remain in control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to catch your eye on this matter in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
moment, Mr. Hill. On many previous occasions the Labour party has attacked the Government on privatisation and argued that there has been an under value sell-off. This is the first time that I have heard an Opposition spokesman propose that in a privatisation it is legitimate to sell under value in certain circumstances. That is an extremely novel proposition. As we are collecting manifesto commitments from the Labour party, I will be most interested to hear how the hon. Gentleman develops his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: By all means. I will do my best to enlighten the hon. Gentleman. This privatisation is different. We are not selling a stock of tangible assets. Amersham International was sold for a disgracefully low sum, as was evident from the way in which the share price rose after privatisation. Amersham International is a successful company that deals in radio isotopes. It sells a specific range of products—and, I accept, offers a specific range of skills—to which it is easy to ascribe a value. The Government failed severely in their duty to the nation by undervaluing that company when they sold it off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to advance an argument on behalf of the work force of AEA Technology, because there are special grounds in this case. We would not suggest that the electricity authorities should have been sold off as workers' co-operatives or as management buy-outs. They were too large and that would have been impractical. The size of AEA Technology and the sheer numbers involved may make it difficult for a scheme to encompass the entire organisation, but the benefits to be gained from selling the organisation whole to the work force may make it worth while trying to do so. We are not saying that the authority must be sold to the work force or not at all—we are arguing that the first option must be a sale in some form to the work force, which is quite different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is room for discussion on the margins of proceeds. It would be reasonable and legitimate, in recognition of the enormous contribution of the AEA Technology work force to the success of the authority as a whole, to sell the employees an interest in the company, if necessary for a lower sum. It would not necessarily be for a lower sum, because there are no assets to be stripped. The profit takers will not be interested in this group—it has no vast holdings of patents that can be sold off. It has sophisticated techniques and skills, but no great store of wealth waiting to be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should prioritise their scheme for privatisation. That is backed by everyone involved. I see no reason for the Government to refuse to act as we suggest. I refer the Minister to the leading article and to the article by David Lascelles in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> of 15 February 1994. David Lascelles wrote that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authority will have to be split into two parts to separate the sellable bits from those which will have to stay in government hands. The radioactive sits left over from 40 years of experimentation and development of the UK nuclear industry will remain the responsibility of the state"—</p></blockquote>
unless the Government's comments at the conference a few
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
weeks ago indicate a change of mind on this matter. His article adds that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the assets being sold will consist largely of the employees' brainpower rather than plant and equipment. Valuing the business will therefore provide a special challenge to City advisers."</p></blockquote>
You bet your boots it will—fancy trying to value brains. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Privatisation could take many forms. The company could be floated on the stock exchange, where its value would be in the order of £200 million. Alternatively it could be sold whole or in bits. However, any purchaser would have to safeguard the independence on which AEA's reputation would depend. There could even be a management buy-out."</p></blockquote>
I shall now turn to the leading article.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very short, Mr. Hill. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the ideal solution must be a management buy-out. This would create a sense of partnership among the company's employees, and guarantee the AEA the independence to underpin its credibility as a consultancy. However it may be too much to expect a state-owned scientific agency to make that sort of leap in one bound—particularly when it does not even have a chief executive."</p></blockquote>
It now has a chief executive. The leader continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The alternative would be flotation as a private company. This would not be easy, however, since investors would have to be sure that the AEA had a worthwhile portfolio of contracts, and that its principal assets—people—would not walk out of the door.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Only as a last resort should the government consider the remaining alternative: sale in whole or in part to trade purchasers. This would be highly unsatisfactory. The AEA would lose its independence and, if broken up, its range of skills as well."</p></blockquote>
I referred to that quotation on Second Reading, so I do not propose to refer to do so again, other than to emphasise our point. The ideal solution must be a buy-out involving management and work force. If the company must be privatised, that would secure the support of everyone concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A successful modern company places a high premium on value added, which depends on the skills and qualities of its staff. Any company that recognises that does better if it arranges for its employees to have a significant personal stake in its capital, and there is much to be said for them having a share of the profits. There are many examples of companies which engage employees' interests, attention and enthusiasm by means of profit-sharing schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal in the amendment is clearly unworkable. It may be possible for employees to find the money to pay for a big, valuable company. Indeed, the West Midlands bus company is about to produce a substantial return for its employees. Included among the people who will profit is a Labour Member of Parliament. Good luck to them, I say. I have no objection to employees owning a business if they can come up with the right offer, but there are many other options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred previously to the privatisation of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
royal ordnance factories, which were separated into different operating arms. The employees of the tank factory, which is in my constituency, were very keen to have a share in the company. The terms governing that sale provided in part that the employees were included, on preferential terms, in the share option scheme of the much larger organisation, the Vickers group, that bought the factory. The overwhelming majority of the employees at the tank factory took up those preferential terms, thereby acquiring rights to buy shares in a much larger company with a freer quotation on the stock market. I do not want to pursue the issue any longer. If I did, I suspect that you, Mr. Hill, would rule me out of order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On the amendment, I am absolutely in favour of the point, well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy, that we should maintain an interest so that we can protect the national interest, especially in the atomic power sector. Such mechanisms have been used in the past and I was a little surprised by the hon. Member for Elmet suggesting that we would be doing less than we should on behalf of the taxpayer and the British people if we did anything other than secure the best price for the shares on the day. I do not understand how on earth that can be a measure of the national interest, but it betrays the attitudes of Conservative Members—that the national interest does not extend beyond securing the best price for a specific company on a specific day rather than considering the long-term ramifications and consequences of a privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstood. I said that we could not sell a company for substantially less than its value if we were trying to pursue proper policies of public prudence in public finance. At the margins, there may be different options that could be expressed in different ways. I have no objection to an employee but-out if the employees can come up with the right price. In most cases, that would be my preferred solution, but we cannot commit the Government to that course of action in the abstract, as the Opposition try to do through the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to protect the public's long-term interests rather than sell at the highest price irrespective of what happens thereafter. Proposals such as retention of an interest were used widely. Golden shares were used widely at the high watermark of privatisation in the 1980's. For people to suggest that there is something improper in that suggests that the privatisation of Jaguar, where a golden share was retained for a certain period to try to protect the company's interests, was improper. In fact, such retention was proved to be necessary by the queue of people to purchase Jaguar as soon as the golden share had run its course. All the companies in that queue were not necessarily planning to continue to produce cars in Britain. There were proposals from General Motors of which hon. Members might not be aware. That company was, effectively, into purchasing the Jaguar badge and name and would have started, almost immediately, to produce cars in Germany and elsewhere. The golden share protected the interests of that company and the national interest. We now propose that we retain a mechanism whereby we can hold an interest and continue to protect the vital public interest. Such a mechanism is of more concern in the atomic power sector than in general manufacturing. I would have thought that our case is far stronger in this instance than it was for Jaguar and for most of the other privatisations that have taken place.

A possible defence that could be offered with regard to the dangers of asset stripping is that we will not be dealing with cowboy organisations. The evidence of past privatisations, however, shows that even reputable companies can behave in disreputable ways. I believe that my constituency provides clear evidence that a privatisation led to what everybody would consider to be disreputable behaviour by a reputable company. That could not have been foreseen; nor was there any mechanism to prevent it from doing so.

We sold Rover to BAe with a dowry of land: 120 acres of the old Standard Triumph factory—hon. Members who accuse us all of being Europhiles will be glad to know that I still deal in acres, not hectares—which had provided 12,000 jobs and produced cars that were famous throughout the world. It was one of the biggest development opportunities in Coventry. We then saw a company that was at the centre of our manufacturing industry being changed into a property company. Attempts were made to alter planning constraints in order to maximise profit and to do away with the job creation opportunities that already existed in the site. Coventry city
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
centre incurred much damage as a result, something that one would not expect from a company such as British Aerospace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, one cannot prejudge the behaviour of such companies once they have been totally privatised. In the atomic power sector—there may well be other sectors that should cause equal concern, but I cannot think of any—we need to retain a mechanism whereby we can protect the national interest on a continuing basis. We must ensure that the interest of shareholders alone is not the sole concern of that company in the future. I therefore support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North was responsible for the 1981 Act when he was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Energy. He went on to greater things in the Treasury but is now back on the Back Benches. In 1981 he described the convoluted process that applied from the 1971 Act through to the 1981 Act and explained in some detail, at column 748 of 
	<i>Hansard</i> for 10 February 1981, why such a transition should take place. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should now like to explain in more detail the provisions of the Bill and why it is necessary. When the company"—</p></blockquote>
the Radiochemical Company—
	<br><blockquote><p>"was set up in 1971, it was envisaged that a minority shareholding would be sold off at some time. As a result, the Act provided for a majority of the voting shares in the company to be retained in the public sector. The Government now wish to have the option of selling more than half the shares"—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 February 1981; Vol. 998, c. 748.]</p></blockquote>
A transitional arrangement was established because that company was becoming essentially a trading company and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy said earlier, even in the circumstances of the period between 1971 and 1981, the Government were not certain of the right way forward.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will continue to explain my point, which is that carefully constructed transitional arrangements were put in place at that time until the picture became clearer to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company under discussion now is different. The same rules do not apply. While it might have been safe in 1981 to dispose of all the shares of Amersham International, it is not necessarily safe to do the same with AEA Technology's shares. The need for transitional arrangements must be reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the transitional arrangements were explained to the House in 1981, the then hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Sir T. Skeet)—spoke of the need to take a cautious approach. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should keep an interest in the Atomic Energy Authority because I think that it is important that we should do so, but I should be prepared to dispose of those companies—BNFL, NNC and the Radiochemical Centre Ltd."</p></blockquote>
Some aspects of that came to pass, and some did not. The then hon. Member for Enfield, North (Mr. Eggar), who bears some responsibility for the Bill, said subsequently:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I feel very humble in following my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Mr. Skeet), whose knowledge in these matters is well known to the House."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 February 1981; Vol. 998, c. 768.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister shook his head when I referred to the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North, but he should remember that his boss was humbled by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
That clearly illustrates why we should take a more cautious approach now. To whom will the company be sold? We do not know. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham has already mentioned what happens when shares are sold on the open market and are attractive to foreign purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy made a point that we should all endorse when he said that the sole value of the successor company was the aggregate skills of the work force. That is a good description of AEA Technology. If is is to be sold off, we should give the greatest priority to finding a way of selling it to the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have negotiated many employee buy-outs. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury mentioned the National Freight Corporation earlier, and I considered that company in some detail. My interest in it arose when it bought a subsidiary of Unilever and took it up into its employee-management ownership scheme. Tensions still exist there, and the model that was adopted then might not be ideal in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most significant deviation from the standard model for management-employee buy-outs found in this country is the employee share ownership plan with voting stock applied to employees' shares that is found in the United States. Such a model might give us a formula for a forward-looking company that is based on the total dedication of its people to delivering scientific and engineering expertise. Such a structure would maintain a focus that would benefit the national interest because a synergy would exist between the shareholders and the public, who consume the fruits of their knowledge. That balance should be explored in great detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current formulation in schedule 2 will not provide enough time and flexibility for that process. If the company is to be sold off, it would be preferable to sell it off as a single company. Against that background, we should maximise every opportunity to bring about the right structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister has fresh ideas on how to bring that about, it would be helpful if he will make them known to the Committee. In the absence of fresh ideas, I hope that he will at least agree to consider the issue further and examine the complex technical issues involved. Some questions cannot be answered until the marketplace has been tested. We must have more flexibility built into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few points on behalf of employees, some of whom are my constituents, in favour of some form of employee share ownership scheme—preferably employees owning the company, if it is to be privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury said earlier that because that had not happened in previous privatisations, it would be unfair for it to happen this time.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
He seems to be arguing that two wrongs make a right. The fact that something has not happened in the past is no reason to restrict the rights of employees in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wider share ownership is a principle that the Government have claimed to support. Why cannot they ensure that their claims to support wider share ownership are brought into practice in this case? I have always been in favour not only of wider share ownership but, more specifically, of employee share ownership. The first tax incentives for employee share ownership were introduced under the Labour-Liberal Administration at the end of the 1970s and have subsequently been advanced by the Conservatives. There seems to be some cross-party agreement on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One main reason to welcome employee ownership of the company is the balance that different types of ownership will promote between the interests of safety and those of company profits. The company may make greater financial profits if it is in the hands of people who are not employees. However, it is in the interests of employees to ensure that safety is paramount, which does not apply when the business is owned by outsiders. So although profitability in purely financial terms may be less, a great deal can be said for selling to employees at a lower price than to outsiders. That brings extra value for the public at large, as additional safety for the taxpayer is assured if the business is in the hands of its employees in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth while ensuring that the company is transferred to its employees rather than to anybody else. Moreover, that could be achieved at a lower price than might be attainable if it is sold on the open market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of the opportunity to correct the impression gained by the hon. Member for Newbury from my intervention. It is true that the more a company is involved in the service sector, the more it is dependent on its employees. Any company is so dependent, whether it has one employee or 4,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also true that service sector companies tend to have higher participation in employee share schemes or profit-sharing schemes. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy is interesting. The Committee clearly agrees that the preferred solution would be, as far as possible, to place AEA Technology's shares in the hands of its employees. The difference between the two sides of the Committee comes down to whether the Government—and hence the taxpayer—should sell off the company at a discount and, if so, how much should go to the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three possible methods for the disposal of AEA Technology—a management buy-out, with shares granted either to management or employees; flotation on the stock exchange; or some form of trade placing. That appears to be the Committee's order of preference, but the amendment would fetter the Secretary of State's discretion about how the company should be privatised be fettered. That is why I oppose the amendment. The Secretary of State needs the maximum discretion when deciding the
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
company's future. If possible, it should be sold as one to the management and the employees, but decisions as to how that should be dealt with should be left to the prevailing circumstances and to the Secretary of State's negotiating ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally support the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy. It is imperative that the company's employees feel that they will be part of its ownership in the future. The privatisation proposed in the Bill should not be happening. We all rely on the company for its expertise in the atomic energy sector. It is essential that the 4,000 employees are kept together so that they continue to be a source of excellence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the debates in this Committee, the future is not clear for the work force, so the present is difficult for employees to manage. The Government do not know how to move forward but the amendment would ensure that, regardless of how the company is sold off or floated, the people working in it would at least own it in part and thus retain a synergy with it. AEA's excellence stems from the excellence of its employees. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy said, the asset that makes AEA Technology a world beater is the brain power to which it has access.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ultimate ownership of the company will, in one way or another, be hybrid. It is widely accepted that the value of the company is not based on fixed capital assets but on intellectual capital and sales of more than £200 million per annum. The valuation will show little in terms of tangible assets but the intangible side of the company, which depends on the work force for its value, is considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the company is based on intellectual capital, it provides the ideal equity on which to form a co-operatively managed organisation. I must declare an interest—I am sponsored by the Co-operative party, so have an interest in promoting it aims. None the less, I hope that the Government will accept that the views I am about to express on co-operative structures are sincerely held and lead to no personal gain for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Industrial Common Ownership Act 1976, introduced by a Labour Government with the assistance of the Liberal party, provides us with a basis on which to consider the most appropriate form of future ownership of the company. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have confined themselves to the concept of a company based on shares that may or may not appreciate in value or give a greater or lesser return. That is locking us unnecessarily into an Anglo-Saxon/Calvinistic understanding of enterprise. The significant point is that we must have a Government who retain some say in the future of the company and its activities—my hon. Friends argued that is for the public good—while embracing the interesting and good idea that ownership and control of a business should be in the hands of those who work in that company. That is encapsulated in the 1976 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have come to understand that people who own
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
something exercise special care for its welfare. Whatever the theory, in practice notions of Morrisonian nationalisation do not result in workers running down the road clapping their hands, doing high jumps and saying how pleased they are to be working for a state-owned company. We must take on the idea of a public enterprise that is owned and controlled by those who work in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the Government go for the best price that they can get for the company, or should they favour what seems to be the consensus view that it ought to be offered first to the workers? We mentioned that the valuation in the ordinary sense would be based on the income generated and the profits, together with the intangible side of the balance sheet—the intellectual capital provided by the staff. I understand from the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> and the 
	<i>Observer</i> that the likely value is about £200 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there an answer to the problem that the Conservatives pose about what should be done in the public interest? Should we go for the largest amount of money we can get for the organisation through nothing better than a public auction, or should we consider the matter in a more intelligent way and think through the implications of the ownership, structure and control of the body as well as maximising the work that it does in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and economy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1976 Act suggests a way forward. The Government could give away the company to the workers. They could give it away—charge nothing, provide it free and gratis—but insist and ensure that the memorandum and articles under which the company operated ensured that were it to be wound up, its entire assets would be returned to public ownership or be passed on to a similar organisation which would continue with the work involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
One characteristic of British industry is that medium-sized companies are scarce because of the nature of shares and how they work to produce working capital for a company. Often a company want to expand but finds that it is unable to raise the necessary finance, so it has to sell more shares or go to a bank or another lending institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Germany, the situation is different and that is germane to the amendment. Middle-sized companies in Germany are very strong and, almost invariably, family concerns. In the German industrial ownership structure, the idea of sharing with the workers on an equal bases has developed and has been part of the so-called economic miracle that has occurred since the end of the war. German companies have a supervisory board. That is my link back to how AEA Technology should be controlled both in the public interest and to gain the efficiencies and economies that we have come to associate with ownership and control being in the hands of those who work in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a supervisory board being included as a hybrid with the 1976 ICO legislation and the specifications of memorandum and articles, we could ensure that guidance in the national interest is provided by that board, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
membership of which could certainly include a nomination from the Secretary of State. It would also include people who currently make up the AEA, those with expert knowledge or long experience in the industry. Therefore, the guidance that we would require could be embodied in supervisory board, which could deal with other interests as well. It could control or, at least, review boardroom perks and other related matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go on for too long although I think that hon. Members would be interested in the models that I am suggesting. I think that there will be another opportunity, perhaps on the Floor of the House. In the meantime, I urge Conservative Members to accept that the consensus that we have forged about the value of the enterprise being owned by the workers is a good one. The Government should find a way to ensure that that is not just an option, but very much the preferred option. The Government ought to encourage, in the way in which Opposition Members have set out and which Conservative Members have supported, that form of ownership, control and structure of the industry. It is a question of taking a positive attitude rather than saying, "Well, we would quite like it." Let us be positive and try to combine the values of public interest with the private efficiency we seek in the kind of hybrid arrangement that I mentioned. Maybe we will have the chance to rehearse those arguments later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The guts of the group of amendments are contained in amendments Nos. 34 and 38 which require the Secretary of State to offer the sale of a successor company to its employees before anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by responding to the comments of the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy on employee participation because, like the rest of the Committee, we regard that as a fundamental aspect of the success of the privatised AEA Technology. All members of the Committee agree that that success will depend on the efforts and the attitude of the staff. We are also concerned that one of management's key tasks, now, as after privatisation, is to ensure that the staff are fully incentivised and fully aware of what is happening. It follows from that that I wold be prepared to consider seriously any bid from a management and employee buyout consortium and, more generally, would want to encourage employee participation in the privatised business. That was emphasised by several hon. Gentlemen, including the hon. Members for Newbury, for Nuneaton and for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe in promoting employee participation as a means of giving people a direct personal interest in the success of their companies. It helps secure commitment to a company's future and encourages an understanding of key business issues such as profit performance, growth and company value. I believe that it is in the long term interests of any company to be privatised that a significant measure of employee share ownership is provided for. In line with that policy, we have consistently made provision for the employees of privatised companies to share in the success of their companies and generally encouraged management—employee bids in competitive trade sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
It would not be appropriate for me to say anything now that could be read as indicating that the Government would give any undue preference to a management—employee bid. But if, in due course, such a bid were to be made, I can assure the Committee that I would give it serious consideration. Similarly, while I have not as yet received any specific proposals from AEA Technology on employee participation, I can assure the Committee that I would expect management to come forward with such proposals and will look carefully at anything that they might put to me. I would not propose to offer a view at this stage on the form any scheme might take because that will depend crucially on the way in which AEA Technology is privatised. My mind is not closed to that way ahead. But I would expect any scheme to be broadly based and recognised the fact that AEA Technology ultimately depends on the efforts of all its staff, not just those at the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Elmet fired a warning shot across the Committee divide—and was endorsed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury—on the question of value for money and duty to the taxpayer. He rightly questioned the idea that was floated by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy of a reduced price in a management by-out. 1 noticed the frisson—I do not know whether it was of excitement or fear—that fluttered through the ranks of Opposition Members when they realised the size of the political argument that their argument opened up. The hon. Member for Newbury with—dare I say?—a little less responsibility ploughed on manfully with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it is clear from all that I have said that I very much sympathise with the thinking behind the amendments. I cannot, however, as the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy has correctly surmised. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that those are not matters for the Bill and that he will withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists has suggested that AEA Technology will fail in the private sector. That sits oddly with the claim by other hon. Members that AEA Technology is too successful to be privatised. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy has at times been a little disingenuous in arguing on the one hand that AEA Technology has no property assets to be stripped and thus will be unattractive, while on the other hand implying that AEA Technology is a pearl beyond price and should be retained in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
As to foreign ownership, Opposition Members suffer from schizophrenia. I merely point to the success of the Invest in Britain Bureau, which brings enormous foreign investment into the country. Products are being made in this country for the benefit of everyone. That drives out imports. Members of the Committee may be interested to know that some 40 per cent. of our exports result from foreign companies establishing themselves in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Opposition Members know, the Government's criteria for the sale are well known and the decision will be made in accordance with those criteria. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy can call us to account for that decision, but I cannot concede the amendment. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
