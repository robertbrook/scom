	<p>4.30 am</p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee has considered the Social Security Benefit (Computation of Earnings) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 2745)."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Amendment Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 2744).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We always have a stream of delegated legislation to implement new ideas from the Government. Such legislation is often dressed up as clarification or, in this case, as helping claimants. I suspect that today's proposals might come under the guise of the improvement category, but might do great harm to many carers. It is useful to discuss the two sets of regulations together because they are inextricably linked, given the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of introduction, I want to consider another recent change to invalid care allowance—ICA—which was announced in the Budget. More streamlining measures will reduce the backdating of invalid care allowance from one year to only three months. Streamlining is always suggested as an efficient and helpful tool. It will save £55 million during the public expenditure period and will cumulatively affect up to 35,000 carers over that time. I use the context of the Budget merely to reinforce our concern that sets of proposals that look as if they will improve matters are often to do with the Budget and with the Treasury imposing certain conditions on Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much concern about the regulations has been expressed by the Carers National Association. Many of my brief comments will reflect the excellent material provided for the debate by that association. I am sure that many hon. Members have copies. The Carers National Association is concerned that the "free week", which was given to recipients of ICA, will be ended. The association is campaigning against that as well as against the changes to the computation of earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
ICA is payable to people under 65 who regularly spend at least 35 hours a week caring for a severely disabled person. People are judged to be in gainful employment if their earnings are £50 or more a week. The first week of a claim was free from earnings assessment under regulation 8(2)(c) of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 as amended. Regulation 2(7)(c) of the regulations that are before us deletes that provision which, in practice, means that ICA claimants who leave work to claim benefit will not be able to do that if their earnings in the week prior to their claim were more than £50. Previously, that was disregarded. That is a key concern of the Carers National Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the changes, the Carers National Association has come up against a problem—as have many of my hon. Friends—in trying to identify the impact on carers of the Government's thinking. My hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, lichen (Mr. Denham) asked a number of parliamentary questions about how many people would be affected by the new regulations. The response was that the costs of obtaining it would be "disproportionate". That is nothing new: the Government often use that ploy. The response also stated that there was "insufficient data" on which to base reliable estimates and it was anticipated that the numbers affected by the regulations would be small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first challenge to the Minister is: if the number is small, how small? More importantly, do the Government have any idea whatever about how many people might be affected? There is a technical point to be made—even by the Carers National Association—that some people will benefit, but there will be many losers too. When we deal with secondary legislation, it is important that we are aware of how many people it will affect. It makes no sense to have the matter driven by cost. We should not disadvantage people or deter them from coming forward. This issue has been the Cinderella of social services and social security provision in Britain. I had thought that we had reached the stage where the matter was being taken seriously, but many carers in the Carers National Association are concerned that we are taking a backward step, and they have made their views clear to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new measures will make it more difficult for carers with fluctuating incomes to predict their earnings. Some carers have easily identifiable work cycles because they take work when the cared-for person is well enough. Other changes, which disallow a range of expenses, will mean that some carers will no longer be eligible for invalid care allowance. The CNA is receiving an increasing number of calls from people who have lost or will lose their ICA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to run through some of the accociation's concerns about what it describes in its briefing as "negative changes". First, the Department of Social Security will now be able to calculate notional earnings. Secondly, carers' earnings will be averaged out over a work cycle. Thirdly, travel-to-work costs will no longer be allowable. The association
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
wants to know why the criteria have been changed and the implications for calculations of accepting all those changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, membership of unions or professional organisations will no longer be allowable. That seems a nit-picking measure. Why, when we do things to people, should we heap a little insult on to injury in relation to measures that I cannot imagine will bankrupt the Treasury? For carers, such measures are an additional irritant that they do not need, especially at a time when they thought that they were belatedly about to receive Government recognition. Fifthly, the briefing states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Other costs will no longer be allowable such as meals at work, accommodation for work, etc.".</p></blockquote>
Another issue is that, at present, carers who receive invalid care allowance can discount costs of substitute care. This disregard will be reduced to only half of net earnings. On the surface, that proposal is ludicrous. We have a first-line care provision by people who want to contribute and, if they cannot, they can acknowledge that someone else will. However, instead of full recompense, half that allowance will be taken away. It sounds mean and miserable but, again, the Minister will have the opportunity to show that I am completely wrong in my judgments about his caring Government. Other issues of concern to the CNA are that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Carers could lose entitlement to benefit in the first weeks of the claim"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will be no free concession in the first week of the claim".</p></blockquote>
I submit these genuine concerns. Often they relate to a small aspect of the matter but they add up to a significant assault on carers' incomes and, equally importantly, an assault on a programme that they thought was improving. I am sure that when the Minister replies, he will say, "Of course, we value carers. Of course, these measures are about efficiency". However, he must justify them a little more than he has done to the CNA. I hope that the Minister accepts the concerns as serious and that he will give us a positive and detailed response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The legislation will have a mixed impact on carers because it includes positive and negative aspects. One positive aspect relates to pensions. I am pleased that half of contributions to personal or occupational pensions will be exempted from earnings calculations. That is a step in the right direction. Another positive change is that substitute care will not have to be carried out by a relative to be exempt. I am concerned, however, that the exemption is being reduced by 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried that some expenses will no longer be allowed. Travel-to-work costs, for example, are particularly important for disabled people who are carers themselves. Such people incur extra costs travelling to work. Although a person who is not disabled may be able to catch a bus, a disabled carer would probably have to take a taxi. Travel-to-work costs should still be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Another grave concern is that carers' earnings are averaged over a work cycle. If carers earn £50 one week and £200 the next week, they receive one week's benefit. Under the regulations, they will receive no benefit. Many carers do not work every week. If the person for whom they are caring is extremely ill one week, they may work fewer hours. If that person is a bit better another week, their hours may increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Carers National Association gave me several case studies, one of which I shall relate to the Committee because it is important that we know how individuals will be affected. Mrs. Park cares for her mother-in-law who is physically and mentally disabled. She works part time as a lab assistant at the local school and earns £70 a week, but she is entitled to invalid care allowance because of travel-to-work costs, union membership, meals at work and clothing allowance, all of which are deductible. When those expenses are no longer deductible, Mrs. Park will not receive the invalid care allowance. If she continues to work, her net loss after tax will be £1,547.56 a year. That is not acceptable. It will encourage many carers who work part time to give up work so that they can claim benefit. It will not be cost effective for them to continue in work unless some money comes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government need to tell us who will be affected by the regulations. There has not been enough research into the number of cases involved. I contacted the House of Commons Library which was unclear how the rules would affect claimants. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether he is clear about that. We must know how many individuals will be affected. Advice agencies will have the problem of explaining to carers who ask about their future entitlement to benefit. The Government say that it is too expensive to find out who will be affected, but I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us roughly how the rules will affect carers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that the regulations will be neutral and that there will be winners and losers. Will the Minister give us hard evidence of that? Carers' incomes fluctuate depending on the health of the person for whom they care. The Carers National Association, which represents 6.8 million carers, points out that the new regulations will mean that many carers will face giving up paid work—although they do a great deal of work in the home looking after the person that they are caring for—because they cannot afford to continue. The Government should examine those issues in greater depth before they proceed with the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.44 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a preliminary point about the manner in which the Government have introduced the regulations. The Minister and I crossed swords—decorously enough, I think—in the letters page of 
	<i>The Times</i> not long ago and I shall repeat my complaint. It is not fitting that we are debating the regulations two months after they came into operation; nor is it fitting that the Government's leaflet
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
announcing the new policy simply said that it will come into force, without referring to any necessity for parliamentary approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replied to my letter in 
	<i>The Times,</i> he said that that is how the negative resolution procedure works. The House accepts the negative resolution procedure on a basis of trust, on condition that the Government do not use it to attempt to smuggle in legislation that has a significant bearing on the lives and well-being of our constituents. But that is what is happening, as my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) and the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) have said. The new regulations are likely to cause hardship, and it seems peculiarly irresponsible of the Government to introduce regulations, the impact of which they have not been able to assess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's response to a written question put to him by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen, he said that the Department had no reliable data on which to base estimates of how many losers there would be. I recognise, of course, that it is a difficult computation, which can only be approximate, but given the obvious prospect that there will be losers, it would not be difficult for the Minister's officials to design the same sort of case studies as those submitted to us by the Carers National Association, one of which was quoted by the hon. Member for Rochdale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, the Government could have taken more care over this and should have ensured that Parliament had the opportunity to scrutinise this significant legislation before it was implemented. This is one more case of the thoroughly bad habits that the Government have got into after becoming habituated to power. They are now using secondary legislation to make drastic changes of major import, and I cannot accept that it was ever the intention of the House of Commons to accept the negative resolution procedure in relation to legislation of considerable substance. It is absolutely fine to use the procedure to make minor technical changes, which we can reasonably assume the House would not feel the need to debate, but it should not be used to implement changes of substance, such as these. I hope that the Minister will say something about that in his winding-up speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulties relating to the Treasury, under which the Minister and his colleagues have been labouring. The departmental change programme requires a 25 per cent. cut in running costs by 1999. That is a drastic cut for the Department to have to face, and it is no surprise—indeed, it is laudable—that the Department is trying to simplify procedures. But if simplification means levelling down, that is a different story. If it means that the administrative convenience of the Department and the economies that the Department is being required to make have greater priority than the provision of proper help to claimants,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
while I appreciate the Minister's difficulty, I hope that he and his colleagues will fight more toughly than they have done in the intra-Whitehall struggles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, there is something negative, if not retrograde, about the substance of this measure. It is desirable to help people to combine work with benefits. If we are seriously attempting to encourage and assist people to move from welfare into work, and to be released from benefit dependency, we must appreciate that we are dealing with a sensitive, finely balanced area, in which it matters very much that we do nothing to discourage people from taking the opportunities that exist in the benefit system—too little appreciated and too little used—legitimately to combine working with the receipt of benefits, so that people can gradually increase their income from work and lessen their dependence on public support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will explain on what principle he felt it appropriate to align the rules for the calculation of earnings for non-means-tested benefits with those for means-tested benefits, because that is what seems to be occurring. We have already seen an example of that in previous important legislation, including that on jobseekers allowance, which involved a switch from the old rules that applied to unemployment benefit to a rather more stringent set of rules. Is it appropriate to implant rules from means-tested benefits into the rules for contributory and noncontributory benefits?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several members of the Committee have gladly acknowledged the fact that not all the changes proposed by the regulations will be damaging to claimants' interests. I am glad to recognise that fact, and to avoid striking an entirely negative note. However, I must be critical of the move from the rules for non-means-tested benefits, under which expenses reasonably incurred—I believe that that was the relevant phrase—could be deducted from the assessment of earnings. That included travel costs, the cost of protective clothing and, importantly, the provision of care for another member of the household while a person is working. There was also a catch-all provision for any other expense that was reasonably incurred. That was a relatively liberal rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposed income support rules, only expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred can be disregarded. That is a stricter provision—there will be no allowance, for example, for fares to work or subcriptions to trade and professional organisations. Why did the Minister feel that it was necessary to tighten the screw in that regard?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed the impact of the new rules on the averaging of earnings. Those rules will also have an impact on notional income, which we have not yet discussed. What is the Ministers view of the notional income rules? Will disabled people be means tested to see whether they can afford a carer? What lies behind the Government's proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal is to average earnings over a period—previously, earnings were attributed to the week in which they were earned. In the absence of a pound-for-pound reduction in benefit for earnings
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
above the limit and of a rolled-up disregard—which is an alternative approach that I hope Ministers will consider using in other contexts—averaging can be a pretty blunt instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee with another case study; I shall simply observe that under the invalid care allowance, carers can earn up to £50 per week. Under the old rules, a person who earned, for example, £200 in week one and £50 in week two could receive one week's invalid care allowance in respect of week two. When earnings are averaged, however, the total earnings—£250—is averaged over two weeks, which comes to £125 a week. With such a weekly average income no invalid care allowance would be payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those carers, whose earnings fluctuate from week to week are occasionally able to get out of the home. If they are wise they may want to keep in touch with the labour market and to maintain their skills, and they may feel a need to prevent their life from becoming domestically introverted, which is liable to happen among those with caring responsibilities. Someone undertaking such a responsibility brings huge benefits to society—and to the Government, too. If the millions of carers in this country did not fulfil their family and domestic responsibilities—which they do gladly—a serious obligation would fall on all of us: an obligation that the Government would have to acquit on our behalf. The Government's policy will make it harder for people to work in a caring profession and to keep in touch with society and the labour market. We should ensure that when they no longer have the responsibility for caring, they are able to regain their place in society and earn a living. It is disappointing that the regulations will make that harder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that one of the reasons for the change is that the Government can expect fewer irrecoverable overpayments. Would it not have been better to address the problem of overpayment directly or by a different route? The chief adjudication officer commented on the deterioration in standards of decision taking on overpayments. I fear that the Government are requiring claimants of the invalid care allowance to carry the can for the inadequacy of the Benefits Agency's administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not add to the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central on the free week other than to say that I share his concern and hope that the Minister will explain the Government's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale mentioned her anxieties about the implications of the regulations for disabled people. It is clear that the application of the new rules to disabled people who undertake exempt work and to people with increased benefits for an adult dependent—who may receive some earnings—will make them worse placed. The regulations are retrograde and at odds with the improvements that the Government have tried to make in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. It is a great shame that, having advanced that distance—although not nearly as far as many of us wanted—they are taking away
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
with the other hand by changing the application of the rules governing earnings compensation in relation to disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Etherington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sunderland, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to go over the same ground as my hon. Friends the Members for Fife, Central and for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth). The point made by the hon. Member for Rochdale about the person of modest means who will be £30 a week worse off says it all. It is ironic that the word "care" is used in the regulations. If ever there was an uncaring attitude, this is it. We heard about the various improvements being made in the scheme. Like everyone else, I recognise those, but they are vastly outweighed by the disadvantage that the people who are caring for others will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it normal for a Government—or, indeed, any body—who say that they value services provided by people to make those people substantially worse off? That is what the regulations will do: there is no mistake about that. Millions of pounds will be saved. It is obvious that the vast majority of those in receipt of benefits at the moment will be substantially worse off. My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon asked what would happen if those people decide that the situation is untenable. What is the next move? Carers are the unsung heroes and heroines of society. One tenth of the population—6 million carers—look after the other nine tenths. They have received shabby treatment for many years and the regulations make their circumstances considerably worse. I cannot understand how the Minister can say, "This person will be £30 a week worse off. We really value the service of such people." There is some hypocrisy in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the social security budget and what is happening in the national health service. Do the Government intend to go as far as they can with carers and wait for some of them to fall away before they decide to be realistic? However much people care for their loved ones, they may be driven towards looking after their own interests. Looking after someone is onerous and most of us are not suited to it. We should compensate those who are prepared to do it with a little more reward than is offered in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the same correspondence as my hon. Friends and find it utterly depressing. It if shows the Government's values, the sooner we get rid of them the better because no other Government could do worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by putting the two sets of regulations in context. The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Etherington) has completely misunderstood the position. There is no suggestion that millions of pounds of programme savings will be made as a result of the two instruments. They are intended to be limited, modest, technical improvements that will have some effect—I stress that it will be relatively modest—on the administrative costs of the Department. If there are different rules for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
different benefits, problems arise when moving staff from dealing with one benefit to dealing with another because they must be retrained. The matter becomes more complicated and mistakes are compounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Member for Sunderland, North and the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon that the Government value carers enormously and that expenditure on invalid care allowance has increased from £4 million in 1978–79 to £526 million in 1994–95. Claimant numbers have risen from 5,000 to 285,000. That is an enormous improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of who will be affected by the regulations, the debate has focused on the problems of carers who declare earnings. They are a modest 7.5 per cent. of all claimants for invalid care allowance. On 13th January 1997—the latest date for which I have figures—the pool was potentially 26,833 people, the vast majorty of whom will not be affected by the changes, which are relatively modest. The hon. Member for Fife, Central, who was the worst offender in this respect, took a number of criticisms by the Carers National Association and completely overlooked the positive changes and advantages that the association was ready and happy to acknowledge. The hon. Member for Rochdale much more fairly said that the regulations include some substantial positive features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing all the benefits referred to in parts II to V of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and I am a little mystified that we have talked so much about invalid care allowance, although I understand why concern has focused on carers. The old rules on the assessment of earnings and all that goes with that, which the regulations will resolve, were not satisfactory for a number of reasons. We have tried to simplify and align the regulations to make them easier to apply and generally fairer. Thus, under the new rules, income tax, national insurance contributions and half of the contributions for personal occupational pensions will become allowable deductions for the first time. That is a major step forward, a major improvement, and it will make more people eligible for invalid care allowance. That has not been sufficiently stressed in the debate and I now do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale made an important point about substitute care. Removal of the restriction that the person concerned must be a relative or someone of the same household is also welcome because that will increase the opportunites for help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other arrangements are set out in schedule 1 of the regulations covering computation of earnings, which deal with miscellaneous deductions. I concede that some features may appear to be the opposite side of the coin, but when considered in context the total effect is a fair, reasonable and modest package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first difficulty concerned the meaning of the regulations in respect of notional earnings. The hon. Member for Fife, Central mentioned that. There is nothing sinister about it. It affects income support in that, if someone is paid 10p instead of the going rate, the adjudicating officer can fix the going rate.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
However, we are discussing what happens when a carer goes out of the household in which he or she does the caring and works for less than the going rate for that job. As with other benefits, it is perfectly reasonable for an adjudicating officer to intervene in rare and exceptional cases, where something is rigged, to introduce a figure for notional earnings. However, the rate of pay for looking after someone is a voluntary matter, therefore, the notional earnings rule does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second change relates to the fluctuation and averaging rules. That aspect of social security is notoriously difficult to get right. For example, there are always problems with boarding-house keepers in south-west England, whose earning patterns do not conveniently fit the civil service pattern of earning the same income for the whole year. It is an ongoing problem to produce a system that is fair to all involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale cited one example and the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon cited another involving £200 one week and £50 the next. Under the old rules, there would be no invalid care allowance on the £200 week, but it would be paid for the £50 week. Under the new rules, if those earnings are averaged out, that allowance will not be payable for either week. However, it is equally possible to envisage circumstances in which a carer wants to get out of the house every other week. Let us suppose that a carer goes out and earns £70 in the first week, nothing in the second and £70 in the third. Under the old rules, the carer would be entitled to one week's care allowance, whereas under the new arrangements, which would average out the earnings, that carer would be eligible for the whole of the period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind that we are talking about a small pool of people, I stress that the number of people affected one way or another is extremely difficult to determine but it is believed to be—and must necessarily be—extremely modest. In trying to find out someone's earnings for social security purposes, it makes more sense—and it is fairer to claimants—to take an average over a fair period rather than take a snapshot of a particular week, which is an artificial technicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked why some deductions for expenses were less generous than hitherto. The reasonableness test was applied in the old arrangement. The new arrangements import extremely familiar tests—we have known them for a long time—that are used by the Inland Revenue. In the case of the employed, those rules are that expenses are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred and, in the case of the self-employed, that they are wholly and exclusively incurred. Those are well-known, easy-to-understand rules and apply appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to professional organisations, the well-known example is that if one belongs to and is employed by a professional body and one has to have a certificate from that body each year, one satisfies the performance test wholly, necessarily and exclusively. It will depend on specific circumstances unless the professional organisation is a more general one. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
is well known and well established in the case of employees. The test for self-employment is more generous as is well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of altering the basis of assessment, I suggest that when one examines the measure as a whole, it is extremely limited in scope, extremely modest and its impact will be very minor indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it will be very minor indeed. Will his Department monitor the position and find out how many carers and, in particular, disabled people who are caring for someone else, will be affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. We always monitor the effect of such changes and we shall proceed to do just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon suggested that somehow we had tried to smuggle in by delegated legisation—in an improper fashion by the back door—a deeply significant, dramatic change. I reject that charge and submit to the Committee that they are modest, technical changes of exactly the kind that are suitable for delegated legislation and, indeed, the negative resolution procedure. Such matters must be got right. There are administrative costs if rules are unduly complicated and unnecessarily complex to administer. It is all very well to say that the 25 per cent. change programme cut in our running costs poses problems for the Department—Ministers would be the first to recognise that, but the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon should bear in mind that the reduction is firmly in the Red Book figures for the controlled totals of expenditure for the Department of Social Security for the next two years. The right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) has said that were the Labour party to get into office, it would observe those precise controlled totals. It might well be that it would be more attractive to a Labour Government to spend money on social security administration instead of helping people, but we believe that would turn matters the wrong way round. If a Labour Government wanted to reverse the change programme—of which this measure is one aspect—there will be expense, which will have to be met somewhere if the controlled totals are to be observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by commending both sets of regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that we have acknowledged and accepted the Government's controlled totals for expenditure, but we have certainly not accepted the Conservative priorities within them. That is an important point, but I shall not digress. I know that you are a tolerant Chairman, Sir Robert, but at this hour, when people are beginning to slump, it might be useful to bring matters to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we asked the Minister how many people would be affected, the answer was: "We don't know". We are assured that the number will be modest and limited and that the people who will be affected will appreciate the measure for what it is—a technical improvement. We have had no proper response. I cannot believe that it does not really matter because statutory instruments are only about technical
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
improvements. We could examine the point in a different way and say that we simply do not care: it is a driven programme which must achieve results. There is little point in monitoring because some of the people involved might have left the system. Who will the Department monitor?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon mentioned sensitivity. If the 25 per cent. change programme means that we are looking across the board and creating universal approaches with little regard to the sensitivity of individual recipients, that will not make much sense to the benefit claimants. Surely we are not a volume Parliament. Surely we should not become concerned only when millions of people are affected, and turn a blind eye to smaller numbers because the impact is modest, limited and about technical improvements. I think that the sensitivity has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to have any confidence in statutory instruments which clearly affect the daily living standards of people who are doing an excellent job, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon said. On the basis that we thoroughly disapprove of the objective of the regulations, we want to divide the Committee on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
