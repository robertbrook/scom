	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 195, in page 14, line 16, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'but shall cease to apply on 1st April 2005'.—[
	<i>Mrs. Butler.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Alan Whitehead 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southampton, Test)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As hon. Members will recall, I was expatiating on the wonders of the local government White Paper, which many people now agree marks a genuine move towards restoring a necessary partnership between central and local government with regard to their respective roles and the best way in which to provide the public with local government services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the new power to cap local authorities that spend less than the SSA exemplifies this new partnership between central and local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is patient, he will find that that issue is dealt with in a subsequent amendment to which I may speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Gentleman does not have an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is contained within the broader question of bringing that new partnership about from the position in which local government currently finds itself after a hard swing on the tiller towards centralism in the relationship between central and local government. I acknowledged earlier the necessity of statute to regulate central and local government relations, but the effect of 18 years of innumerable legislative provisions was to build a climate within local government of distrust, despair and a feeling that everything was run from the centre. The necessary relationships have thus become distorted over that long period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find those words amazing. The swing of the tiller is very different from the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. One needs only to consider the reserve powers specified in the document this morning to recognise that the swing of the tiller is what will happen if the Bill is passed unamended. I accept that the hon. Gentleman wants some
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
amendments—I may be tempted to join him if he has the courage to put those amendments to a vote—but the swing is quite the opposite of the one that he is trying to portray.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the technical difficulties faced by Conservative Members attempting to redefine their position on local government in performing an 180 deg mid-air turn while suspended on the end of a rope. I sympathise with their problem, but it does not bear analysis to suggest that the Bill—and the White Paper and the Government's concerns for local government—somehow represent a further swing of the tiller towards centralism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That analysis is unsustainable because of the task that the Government face to bring about that new partnership after 18 years of Conservative legislation. Their difficulties could be likened to attempting to change the wheel on a car while it is still being driven along the road. The Government need to place legislation on the statute book that will allow local government to breathe and find its own identity once again, and to play a relevant and important role in the affairs of the nation at a local level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Christine Butler 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the net effect of the Bill will be to decrease the Secretary of State's reserve powers, not increase them, as Opposition Members suggest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Opposition Members take great delight in counting the Secretary of State's new powers, forgetting the powers that he will relinquish when the Bill is enacted. It would be a crude measure to tot them up, but it would show that, when the Bill is enacted, there will be far fewer powers of direct intervention—power to the centre—than there was before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restoring the equilibrium between central and local government will be a long and difficult process, and the Government should ensure that that process works as well as possible, in their interests and those of local government. That is the key issue. It is understandable that certain reserve powers are held by the Government. The amendment poses the question whether the changes that the Bill makes to the relationship between local and central Government are an end in themselves or part of a process. If they are part of a process, a strong suggestion can be made that the relationship is under constant review. If a new relationship is in being, is it necesssary for the Government to keep the reserve powers, or should they be amended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that the schedule shall cease to apply on 1 April 2005. That may be an arbitrary point, but the amendment was drafted to fit into the Bill. I want to know whether my analysis of the relationship, the end point and the way that the process will work, is endorsed by my hon. Friend the Minister, and, if so, whether she could say something about the reserve powers in the Bill. Ideally, reserve powers should not be used or, less ideally, should be used only when a local authority has departed flagrantly from what is in the interests of a good relationship between local and central Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
and between the local authority and its people. I shall be interested, and probably reassured, to hear my hon. Friend describes how that relationship will work. That is the purpose of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and what he wishes, and so does the Minister, but what he wishes is not in the Bill. There is no limit to the proposal; it is subjective and could be applied to any or no local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the worst things about being the leader of a local authority under the Conservative Administration was the atmosphere that pervaded any discussion of local government. The attitude of Ministers at those meetings was, "We are going to tell you what to do, you will go away and do it." The Bill is about creating a climate in which to forge new ways of doing things. What is written in the text concerns a worst-case scenario. As local government comes out of the shadows of the way it has been treated for so long, I hope that most of the proposals will be regarded as a worst-case scenario and will not even be considered in the day-to-day dealings between central and local government. If that happens, there will truly be a new era, and my memory of the oppressive way in which central Government dealt with local government over the nightmare period in the middle to late 1980s will be erased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 23 repeals the existing capping legislation and, not suprisingly, if that was all it did, Liberal Democrats would wholeheartedly support it. But crude and universal capping is to be replaced by what the Secretary of State has called "Prescott's sophisticated and targeted capping". 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, that is an interesting concept. This retains many of the features of the existing regime and adds some new powers to set different capping criteria for different categories of authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a democracy in this country—allegedly— and in 2002, or before, there will be a general election. I cannot believe that the Government are so cast-iron certain that they will win that election that Labour Back Benchers are tabling an amendment to keep these reserve capping powers until 2005 and that a Labour Secretary of State will carry on until then. Do they believe that these powers are the worst case scenario, and that it does not matter if they are in the Bill because they will not be used?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What if there is a Tory Secretary of State in 2002? The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) has similar memories to me when I led a council of the way that the Tories treated local government. If there is a Tory Secretary of State, is the hon. Gentleman sure that he or she would not use those reserve powers? Would not it make much more sense for this Government to put into action its rhetoric during 18 years in opposition when Labour Members opposed capping powers and central Government interference in local authorities ability to set their own budgets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian White 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady suggest that we should go back on our manifesto commitment to replace crude and universal capping and retain reserve powers? Does she suggest that we should break our promises?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that every Labour party's manifesto commitment has been enacted. I will not stray too far from the Committee's business, but I could mention the freedom of information legislation. [Hon. Members: "On its way."] All sorts of things are on their way. We will have to hope that they arrive. Other measures have appeared, such as the draconian Immigration and Asylum Bill, which had its Second Reading last night. Many who read the Labour manifesto and voted Labour would not have been happy about that. But you will stop me, Mr. O'Brien, if I continue with a list—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has dried up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not dried up at all. The list is of those areas where the Labour party has fallen far short of the promises that it made before it got into government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Liberal Democrats are absolutely opposed to capping. I had understood that Labour Members were also opposed to it: they certainly made loud noises to that effect in opposition. If the reserve powers of capping are to be retained, they should be spelled out in the Bill and not left to the whims of the Secretary of State. Whether or not one accepts that a Labour Secretary of State is bound to be benign, it could well be me and there is no reason to suspect that I would be any more benign than a Labour or Conservative Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have heard already in Committee, the process of power corrupts everyone. We are living in a topsyturvy world where Conservative Members have suddenly decided that there should be no interference in local government finance and are now opposed to capping, having had years of practice of putting it into place. Labour Members are suddenly in favour of reserve powers for capping because they do not trust Labour councils to stay within what they consider to be reasonable guidelines on spending. It is not just that they do not trust their own councils, they do not trust local people either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to retain those powers till 2005 on the spurious grounds put forward by the hon. Member for Castle Point (Mrs. Butler) that modernisation would be working well by then. The hon. Lady would not let me intervene on her and I wanted to ask for her definition of "working well". Local government in Britain is far ahead of where the Government think it is. It is time that people in Government and in the civil service got out and saw what is happening in local authorities. We can all pick on Doncaster, Westminster or wherever—the small number of instances where things have gone wrong. Hundreds of councils have been consulting local people by, for example, holding referendums on their budget priorities or council tax increases. They are doing all that is in the Bill, and are well ahead of where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0987">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
the Government think they are. The Government still distrust them almost as much as the Tory Government did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, as a Liberal Democrat, the hon. Lady has the luxury of being able to pontificate, as she has been doing, but will she tell hon. Members the Liberal Democrat view? Does the hon. Lady believe that the Government need to retain any reserve powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our view is that local government should have constitutional independence from central Government. We have discussed that in Committee before. I understand that Labour Members disagree and view local government's role as subservient to central Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the hon. Member for Southampton, Test said previously. He did not accept my definition—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment, when I have finished my sentence. He did not accept my view of how people in local government and Labour party members traditionally perceived the relationship of central Government and local government. If he wants to say that I am wrong, he is welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I recall is that I attempted to define the present statutory position of local government, and said that to change that fundamentally one would have to rewrite the constitution of Great Britain completely and introduce a constitution that separated various levels of power. I challenged the hon. Lady to explain how that would be done and what it would mean, but as far as I can understand, her party has not spelt the matter out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: About four years ago my party produced a model written constitution which set out the relationship between the Government, a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly, regional government and local government. If the hon. Gentleman is interested, I shall make sure that he receives a copy. It would be rather nice if the Labour party chose to steal and implement one of our policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the question of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas), we are opposed to capping. We do not see that the Government should tell local government and its electors what local authority budgets should be set. We are also in favour, as I have said many times, of a proportional voting system in local elections. That would give local electors far more power to influence the people they placed in local government office. In the context of a PR system for local government, where accountability of the elected to the electors is much better, we believe that freedom could be given to local government to set its own budgets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) in the Chamber explain the Liberal Democrats' commitment to adopting the single currency immediately. How can the hon. Lady's position be consistent with the need to maintain the convergence criteria for monetary union—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) need not answer that. We are straying from the amendment and I ask hon. Members to return to the business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. I was about to say that I am not responsible for my party leader, and he probably denies responsibility for me. I am glad that I do not need to answer, but in any case I do not see a contradiction between being in favour of close integration with Europe and greater powers for local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a member of Somerset county council and caps were repeatedly imposed, Conservative councillors used to say that they did not know why the Tory Secretary of State did not do away with capping, because that would put much greater pressure on elected members to decide their priorities, and we could no longer get away with saying that the cuts were not ours, but the Tories', or that it was not us, but the Tory Secretary of State, who was setting the budget and deciding by how much the council tax should rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a strong reason for the Goverment to stop interfering in council budgeting. It would restore the link between the electors and the elected. There would be accountability. Continued capping will keep the public confused about who is to blame for budget cuts or council tax increases. It also undermines local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not oppose amendment No. 195.I hope that the Labour Members who were brave enough to table it will have the courage of their convictions and press it to a vote. We oppose capping altogether. However, amendment No. 195 would at least put an end date on the Secretary of State's reserve powers, albeit later than we should like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. Under pressure from my hon. Friends, the hon. Member for Taunton gave the game away. She made it clear that Liberal Democrats would not give untrammelled power to local government until the modernisation programme that they support was put through. Now we know where the hon. Lady stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an interesting debate this morning. Having discussed the amendment with me, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test, made his point most effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) intervened, but I was not sure whether he was speaking tongue-in-cheek. He may not have told us about the lobotomy that excised all his memory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends might be interested to learn what the right hon. Member for Richmond, York (Mr. Hague) said about capping this weekend.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
Unfortunately, they have not had an opportunity to consider those remarks, as they were not reported in the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Leader spoke about tackling the thorny issue of capping. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Conservatives must look at how we can achieve more independence and accountability for local authorities, with all the difficult choices that involves, so that we are able to abolish central controls on local government like capping."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that is a step forward from what Conservatives did in government. However, it is not a very big step. At least it acknowledges difficult choices and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Government have confronted those choices and responsibilities and have kept their manifesto commitment. Last week, the hon. Member for Taunton told the Committee that I was pathetic for going back to manifesto commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say "pathetic".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may not have used that word, but she implied that I was pathetic. She seemed be querying the point of going back to manifesto commitments. She seemed to be asking what on earth manifesto commitments mean, and why they are being dragged in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Manifesto commitments mean something to me. Opposition Members may have forgotten what we said at the election, so I will remind them. In the manifesto, we said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although crude and universal council tax capping should go, we will retain reserve powers to control excessive council tax rises."</p></blockquote>
When I fought the election, I faced the electorate on that promise. I am not reneging on it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which part of the Labour manifesto promises that a Labour Government will introduce council tax benefit capping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are introducing council tax benefit subsidy limitation. I do not see that as council tax capping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that was not in the manifesto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not. However, the Government are doing several things that go beyond manifesto commitments. At the same time, we are ensuring that we keep all of the 167 commitments that we made in the manifesto. The measure is one of those commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is full square with the manifesto, and I am not at all ashamed of it. Indeed, I remind the hon. Lady that a Labour party policy statement including the plan was passed unanimously at conference in 1994. This is a Government who deliver on their promises, which were not suddenly made at the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have enjoyed the debate so far and am looking forward to the debate on the schedule. I appreciate my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test aspiring to the Government's not having to use reserve
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
powers by 2005: indeed, I share his aspiration. The Government, in partnership with local government, are, as my hon. Friend said, putting in place an ambitious programme for modernising local government. Best value, which we have debated at length, is a key part of the programme. We hope that by 2005 other aspects of the reform agenda for local government, such as new political management structures, improvements in local democracy and a new ethical framework, will be fully in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady explain how a secret Cabinet Committee of one party, which is one of the new management structures that her party is putting forward, will help councils to set a lower council tax, so that they will not need to be capped?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I may stray out of order if I answer the hon. Lady's question. I say only that other people in her party do not hold that view, but she will have the opportunity in Committee to scrutinise that idea before the Bill comes to the House as a full Bill. A draft Bill will be presented which we shall ask a Committee of both Houses of Parliament to examine prior to its introduction as legislation on Second Reading. I hope that the hon. Lady and her colleagues will enter into that debate in a spirit that demonstrates their interest in finding new ways of making local government effective and of engaging its citizens' interest. If she does, she may listen much more openly to the arguments of my party—and those of her own party, which is now trying out some of these ideas at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taken together, the reforms will bring about a fundamental change in local government, improving and modernising it and ensuring that local people feel that it is working with them and for them. I have a feeling that that is not how many people respond to local government at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the modernisation agenda is the improving of local financial accountability. The Government want local authorities to take full responsibility for their decisions on spending and taxation, and for local people to have greater influence over decision making. We hope that these changes— improving best value and local democracy, and so on—will achieve that, and that we shall therefore not have to use reserve powers to limit council taxes and precepts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is important that we retain the reserve powers. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West made a significant point when he intervened on the hon. Member for Taunton. We have said consistently that we do not run away from the fact that there is a national interest which—in terms of this country ever being ready to adopt the euro and make those changes—is the amount of its debt. The amount of a country's public borrowing is one of the Maastricht criteria: it is an aspect of the national interest, which is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Curry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Skipton and Ripon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has introduced a new note into the debate. I know that you will pay particular attention to it, Mr. O'Brien.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am watching very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Currey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister claims that there is a national interest. She also says that she will consider whether a council's actions seem to be sanctioned by the electorate, and thus have democratic legitimacy. Would the Government ever cap a council that had fixed a council tax after consultation with its electorate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows that we cannot currently take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will calm himself, I stress that that applies to the present, and to existing legislation. No one should be under any illusion that I am talking about the future, rather than the current year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, we shall take such matters into account. We shall ascertain which questions were asked and the way in which they were asked. The right hon. Gentleman may know that Milton Keynes council has consulted its electorate this year. The turnouts for the referendum on setting the council tax was 20 per cent, higher than that for the previous local elections. We cannot legally take that into account this year. However, in future, we shall have to consider it. That does not mean that we will agree with every result. If a council asked a biased question, and the turnout was only 10 per cent., the result would not have the legitimacy of a vote on an independently asked question, for which there was a higher turnout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But it is possible for a council to ask an honourable, honest and straightforward question to which it receives an honest answer. However, the wishes of the local people, as expressed in the answer, might not be in the national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that—it is in the nature of democracy. Those problems have to be debated at the time. We shall not run away from that because it is up to the Government to try to win support for their perception of the national interest. That has been the case in the past, and will continue to be so in future. We shall not be able simply to take a neutral position. We shall have to explain our perception of the national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the explanation, which contains so many "ifs", "ands" and "buts". If the Minister can influence a decision on whether a local authority's actions are in the national interest, will she or the Secretary of State make a statement to the House to enable us to debate and question the decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the procedures of the House will remain as they are. If a Secretary of State decides to cap an authority, the decision will be put to the House. Such a decision will be made in the normal way. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Mole Valley intervened because he will be interested in a particular council, which he knows. Its actions show why all the modernisation procedures should be in place. That council does not have annual elections. Last year, there was an election, and the council reduced the council tax by some 30 per cent. There are no elections for another three years, and the council is considering increasing the council tax by 40 per cent. How does that council display responsibility? How does it care for council tax payers? It uses a blatant electoral ploy. At the moment, all we can do is identify the sort of behaviour in which it indulges. It is not responsible behaviour by a democratic body. It has made its decision knowing that it does not have to face the electorate this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister would doubtless welcome Westminster's bid to set the lowest council tax in the country. Can we assume that Westminster is now thoroughly rehabilitated in the Government's affection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows that I cannot mention Westminster because of court proceedings outside this place, and he will not tempt me down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Jackie Ballard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be interested to know whether the Government, having increased several taxes while in office, are promising a sudden dramatic decrease in taxation during the year in which they face the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the issue of local government finance and the national debt. The Minister prayed in aid the fact that we might join the euro, so that local government finance might need to be taken into account. Does she accept that we do not have to measure the public sector borrowing requirement in this country as we do, and that most European countries do not count local government debt as part of the national debt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady wants so many conditions laid down before we can proceed that she continually undermines her argument. We have what we have. The public sector borrowing requirement has already shifted. It is not purely in the hands of Governments to change, but depends on how other financial interests see and understand the national debt. Our determination is to be responsible with national finances, so we will always seek a balance. We will also be honest about the national interest and the best way to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, because of our recognition of the national interest, it is important for us to retain these powers. While we hope and expect that all local authorities will be responsible and prudent, we cannot be complacent towards the provision of good services at prices that council tax payers are prepared to pay. Certain councils are letting us know that in no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
uncertain terms. The Government have a responsibility to local council tax payers to retain reserve powers to protect them, if necessary—as we promised in our manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that we hope that those powers will be used rarely, if at all. If our modernisation programme receives the time and support of the House, the future for local government finance—and the partnership between local and central finance—will be secure and a future Government may not need to use those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, we want to focus most of the time available for debate on schedule 1 and its amendments. However, I want to make it clear that we oppose clause 23 in principle, and that we will vote against it as one of our major objections to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to set out briefly how we should conduct the remainder of our debate. We have just discussed a useful amendment exchanging party political points. Now that is behind us I hope that we can debate the real issues. However, to make a party political point, this is not the Labour party's finest hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor indeed was our supervision of local government.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that translate into an apology?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to make this a pathetic party political exchange I feel rather sad for him. Given his position with regard to the Local Government Association, I should have expected him to treat the matter as seriously as he pretended to a few minutes ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not given to apologies, as I am about to demonstrate. I agree with my hon. Friend that capping had immense disadvantages. The main disadvantage is political: the Government never win the argument whoever they are. If the Minister gets to the stage of capping, she will discover that. I would therefore be amazed if the Government capped a single authority this year despite the fact that a number of authorities will be between two and three times above the notional level that the Government have suggested council tax should rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
The development of the role of local government, particularly the development of the enabling function, the way services develop, the bringing in of private sector partners, is essential and I am delighted that the Government are continuing that evolutionary trend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend and I would not dream of apologising on his behalf. I want him to be assured of that. But let us all agree—this is a complex and unhappy business for the relationship between central and local government. We should all want to improve it. 
	<i>[Interruption]</i> I am disappointed by Labour Members who are treating this matter with levity. Local authorities like Derbyshire and Somerset which have already been capped by the Government are not happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the election, we capped openly and, we would say, fairly although Labour Members would naturally say, unfairly. They opposed it in principle and were vociferous in that opposition. They were joined by the Liberal Democrats. The tables are now turned. The Labour Government are now, some would say, intensifying the capping powers available to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

The Minister's opposition to capping for the past 18 years has been rather exposed by the position she now adopts. To persuade the Labour party conference to sign up to the abolition of crude and universal capping created the impression that the Government were against capping. Yet now we find that the words "crude and universal" did not describe capping, they were a qualification of the Labour Party's commitment. The Government are not abolishing capping per se, but what they consider to be the crude and universal part of it.

The hon.

The hon. Lady's point about Maastricht is irrelevant. If she wants to discredit monetary union even more quickly than the Government she should carry on in that vein; I shall be delighted.

Amendment No. 206 wants the Government to recognise that there are low-tax authorities.

The way that the Labour party carried on in opposition gave the impression that money was lavished on that authority.

	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Occasionally, we meander away from the scene. My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has filled his pen, so I shall proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 206 would require the Government—who have demonstrated a subjective approach throughout the Bill, and especially in schedule 1—to be sufficiently fair and recognise that some local authorities have managed to provide quality services, very often top quality services, while keeping their council tax down. That is best value by any definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does nothing to protect those authorities, which, like all local authorities, have no incentive to keep their council tax down. I am not referring to increases, but the overall period of council tax. Amendment No. 206 aims to bring that message home and ensure that classes of local authorities are recognised. Those that are facing similar problems and conditions should be classed together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 208 would prevent the measure from being subjectively applied—or not applied—to individual authorities. It would also recognise that most authorities—with the exception of the Greater London Authority, for the moment—are in a class of authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule is subjective, so an individual local authority may be selected for capping. Any one of four powers may be applied to such authorities. Equally, a local authority may be capped while a neighbouring authority—in the same class, under the same conditions, producing the same figures and the same service—may not be. The failure to cap in such conditions may be more intriguing, and may cause greater concern to local government as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 209 addresses the crunches referred to by Liberal Democrat Members. We touched on those crunches on Second Reading. Schedule 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining categories of authorities for the year under consideration the Secretary of State shall take into account any information that he thinks is relevant."</p></blockquote>
It is an unfortunate mistake that "categories" has been used instead of "classes"; it is also unfair on local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may hear placating arguments that certain types of action will not be taken. Liberal Democrats will probably remind us that a Conservative Secretary of State may apply the measure. However, the schedule's wording is so open that it would be possible for the Seceretary of State to deem that any local authority with a name beginning with "W" and ending with "th" would be capped on those grounds alone. That is technically possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Lady ought also to have noticed, if she picked up the paper that was distributed this morning, that it states, as item (i) of the four powers that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"may designate the authority in-year (as is currently the sole option)".</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State wished to, he would be able to say, "You have so many hotels, so the streets are a bit messier, therefore I shall or shall not designate you." It could depend on how he felt after breakfast. The point has been reached where there is excessive potential for a subjective approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing clause 23 and amendment No. 195, which, surprise surprise, was withdrawn, hon. Members said that it would improve local government and remove centralising powers. That is patently untrue. One has only to look, not even at the schedule itself but at the explanation of it, to see how arbitrarily dictatorial it is. "Prescott's subjective capping" is what we have been given as a proposal, starting from 2000. The measure establishes powers way beyond anything that I would ever have imagined. Having been an Environment Minister in the mid and late 1990s I understand why the Minister, given the present state and form of local government finance, needs some reserve powers—but not the ones proposed. They are way over the top. The opportunity that they present for a subjective approach to be taken by any Secretary of State—not necessarily the present one—allowing pork barrel politics, is obvious. I hope that this matter will be given serious consideration, and that even if the wording of the amendments is not quite correct, it will be accepted that local authorities are deeply concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley about schedule 1 in general and the amendments. In particular, amendment No. 206 seems to have a very reasonable

aim with respect to factors that would make a council designable—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps I mean designatable. I shall leave that to the 
	<i>Hansard</i> editors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a local authority would not be designatable if its band D council tax is less than the average for authorities in the same class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems reasonable. As the White Paper makes clear—I would like to find the reference, but I cannot—capping is ultimately about limiting excessive council taxes. Local people need protection from excessive taxes rather than from increases as such. The Minister must have many interesting discussions with the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) about the use of public opinion in establishing the credibility or popularity of a particular budget. She will have to take into account what proportion of those who may be consulted as electors actually bear the burden of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the tax is already low, what is the case for capping? A high tax could be supported by many people who do not pay it because of personal circumstances—they may be protected from paying it because they are on benefit or because they are not householders. One of the effects of returning to the council tax was to place the burden on householders rather than individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a large disparity, the Minister will have to ignore a particular expression of public opinion and take the national interest into account, as she said. However, how can it be justifiable to use these extraordinarily draconian and selective powers against a low-spending authority? That applies to the authority mentioned by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. I hope that we shall hear more from him about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assist the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I have found the reference in the White Paper that the hon. Gentleman sought. It is in paragraph 5.12, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the reserve power were to be used, the main intention would be to limit excessive council tax rises."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am questioning. I am sure that the Minister would agree that there is no case, in principle, for capping a local authority whose spending is below the SSA. The schedule reproduces one of the features of the White Paper. Paragraph 5.11 mentions reserve powers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to require councils to reduce their budget requirement to below that in previous years or below their Standard Spending Assessment."</p></blockquote>
Yet the Minister has provided no justification for why that power should be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks about excessive or large increases, but she has used percentage increases in her examples. A high percentage increase of a low council tax may still be a small rise overall. Consequently, the Minister's favourite local authority in London still has the second
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
lowest council tax—if the Minister is right and if the rises notified in the newspapers, which I believe are incorrect, actually took place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been drawn to my attention that a large increase in a low-spending authority still impacts on the rate of inflation. However, if that is so, something must be wrong with the inflation calculation, which should take into account the weighted average of council tax increases. The national percentage increase in council tax is the volume of tax increases in absolute terms as compared with the previous year. That, and not big increases in authorities that are already spending small sums, is what impacts on the retail price index.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands. The inflation is for the person paying the council taxes. Regardless of what a person starts at, having to provide a big rise in one year impacts on his purse and his ability to manage his finances. The White Paper makes it clear that we have a responsibility to take an interest in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are moving into interesting territory. The Minister made it clear that the whole basis and necessity for the powers was the national interest, in, for example, observance of the Maastricht criteria. We found ourselves in the same sort of trap because the Government get it in the neck when council taxes rise. The Government are exercising here their prerogative to limit an unpopular increase by a local authority, not for national macroeconomic reasons but because they feel that they have a duty and obligation as a democratically elected authority to limit the expenditure of another democratically elected authority. That has nothing to do with the national interest, it is politics. The Minister's waffle about the national interest has just been exposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the nub of the true issue with council tax capping. We live in a unitary state where people feel entitled to the same level of service for the same amount of council tax wherever they live. Take, for example, education. We do not allow children in different parts of the country to be disadvantaged by where they live. We expect to deliver high quality education throughout the country, and our voters expect it. At the same time, because we have the area cost adjustment, we do not expect the higher cost of providing council services in some areas than in others to be reflected in council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following that logic, is the hon. Gentleman saying, for example, that Buckinghamshire's selective education system, which costs the taxpayer there more, should be scrapped in favour of a comprehensive system—in the national interest, and in the interests of efficiency and quality education across the land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased, Mr. O'Brien, to hear that I will not get drawn into that. I am happy to debate the merits or otherwise of selective education. The two selective schools in my constituency have a beneficial effect on education in the area generally,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
which is why we have some of the top schools in the country, among them comprehensive schools and grammar schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman tried deliberately to obscure the real point that I made, which is that people throughout the country expect the same basic standard of service at the same basic cost. The Government now have a constitutional locus across local authority finance, which is to level the playing field for the voter. When things begin to get out of kilter, and the pressure turns on local authorities, the blame is put first and foremost on the Government. Local electors hardly bother to vote in local elections. Turnouts are low—under the Government they are even lower than they were for the Conservatives; I can make a party political point about that—but when local authorities go wrong the finger is pointed at Government and the political fallout finishes up in the Secretary of State's Red Box and in the House of Commons. Our debates about, for example, sparsity allowances, about the £100 million withdrawn from county councils and regions that were previously urban areas, and about how much was given to Wandsworth council by the previous Government, are all arguments about national political issues. In the long term, we have to find a way of trying to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mediate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must try to find a way of transferring responsibility downward, to reduce the need for Government mediation. The Bill says nothing about that. On the contrary, the Government make themselves yet more responsible for the quality of local authority services through establishing performance standards and the best value process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 208 would replace subsection (5) of proposed section 52B of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 with:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any principles determined for the year must be such that the same set is determined for all authorities (if more than one) billing within the same class."</p></blockquote>
That should not be too much to ask. If we are to have a mediation process, it should treat all authorities in the same way. The Minister admitted that the Government respond to political pressures. Even if small, low-spending authorities, apply only minor pressures, the Government should not use the powers in the schedule to respond to them on a selective, arbitrary basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of Conservatives Members' arguments for retaining compulsory competitive tendering was that, even if a council provided reasonably cheap services, it did not necessarily provide the best possible value, and that, therefore, councils should be considered individually. The hon. Gentleman now argues the opposite: that councils and council taxes should be considered in groups and that we should not consider best value on an individual basis. What is his genuine view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is floundering, and makes a rather poor point. The central point is that the party that she supported, and believed would abolish crude, universal capping, may do away with the fairness in that system. It is ironic that the more open handed and level a system, the more quirky it may appear in some circumstances. It is being replaced with an entirely selective system, which will operate at the behest of the Secretary of State. It is surprising that the hon. Member for Northampton, North, who has a track record in local government and is committed to it, is willing to go along with such a system, and makes silly, irrelevant points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 209 would omit one of the most pernicious aspects of the arrangement for which the schedule provides. Proposed subsection 52B(7) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining categories of authorities for the year under consideration the Secretary of State shall take into account any information he thinks is relevant."</p></blockquote>
That is a pretty blank cheque for the Secretary of State. If there is a judicial review, and a Labour Member supports a local authority's challenge to the vires of a capping decision by the Secretary of State—perhaps a Conservative Secretary of State—that Secretary of State can, in law, use any information in his defence as long as he can prove that it is rational and reasonable. I look at the hon. Member for Clwyd, West, who is a lawyer, when I say that. In the Minister's opinion, what sort of information should be specified? Is she prepared to give examples of information that the Secretary of State will take into account?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we pass over subsection (7), the least the Minister can do is explain its purpose and the reason for its inclusion in the Bill. Surely the preceding subsections of proposed section 52B provide sufficient grounds for the Government to decide whether local authorities should be capped. The catch-all provision of subsection (7) gives further discretion to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State can pluck reasons out of the air, relevant to that authority, for picking on it to the exclusion of other authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not in Welsh mode at that point. I hope that my hon. Friend will illuminate the Committee on that later. The powers exercised by the Secretary of State will be exercised by the Welsh Assembly. Though it is a Crown body and will be acting in this quasi-judicial capacity, in loco Secretary of State, so to speak, it is a political body. Capping powers will be exercised by vote in the authority. The political complexion of its decisions will be that much more transparent. That may be an Achilles heel in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas the Secretary of State will be advised on his capping powers by the Department's solicitors and ultimately the Attorney-General and schooled by the eminent civil servants so that he may not make political mistakes, in some rash political outburst the Welsh Assembly might well make a decision that is subject to adjudication by the courts and able to be overturned by the courts. But I will let my hon. Friend explore that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dangers in the schedule are evident. Our proposals for ameliorating the effects of the schedule are perfectly reasonable. There is one amendment that I have not addressed and I am waiting to see whether one of the Labour Members in whose name it stands, will raise the issue so that we can discuss it as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 197. Its purpose is quite apparent. I am however reminded of the palaver that surrounded the allegedly carefully organised capping regime under the previous Government. As far as I can see, each year the Government looked carefully at who was likely to come up for capping, worked out a regime to catch those and not others who might objectively have been in the same position but were of a different colour, and declared the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Caught up in that charade were the arbitrary swings in the SSA methodology whereby local authorities that were apparently relatively good boys and girls one year, could be bad in another year without doing anything significantly different. The Government are determined to have a good look at that, among other things, during the three year moratorium on SSA formulation. That is upcoming. The difficulty of producing up-front rules when methodology changes as it does, should be apparent to all. Therefore, in the process by which capping takes place—in the rare circumstances in which it is necessary—stating that there will not be such behaviour again is a wise move and a good step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, however, would include in the Bill some suggestions about the circumstances in which local authorities may consider that the Secretary of State may not be minded to act. That is set out in the second part of the amendment, which includes considerations such as whether the local authority has a positive record in delivering best value, whether the local electorate supports the proposed budget—there was support in Milton Keynes for a level of council tax between the lowest option and the highest option; it was not below its spending budget—and whether the local authority had attained beacon status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
The amendment proposes that the Secretary of State may take into account other factors. It does not set in stone a particular series of criteria—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of curiosity, the hon. Gentleman mentioned beacon status. There is not a beacon anything at present, so it cannot be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point in principle. We are not discussing whether or not beacon status is awarded to local authorities. However, it is difficult to devise a series of criteria which does not take into account what is currently under substantive discussion in local government. However, I tabled the amendment as I felt that it was necessary to engender such a debate in Committee, but I take the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be a good idea for the Bill to include indications of how local authorities might weigh all those factors in considering their SSAs, their spending and their overall performance and what, therefore, the Secretary of State might determine. That may be a way forward. It may be accomplished by protocol or by discussions with the LGA about the circumstances which will determine a capping environment. I would be interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Minister whether she thinks that any or all of those options are worth further consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One problem is that the amendment would give the Secretary of State yet more discretion. I believe that the hon. Gentleman instinctively shares that anxiety, even though intellectually he has taken a different road. The Secretary of State would have more scope to set principles which may exempt certain unspecified categories, which may apply to those with budgets under a level specified by the Secretary of State and which only provide services as specified by the Secretary of State. In such cases, would it not put more power into the hands of the Secretary of State? The hon. Gentleman wants a regime that leaves local authorities with more flexibility, rather than their having to beg the Secretary of State for favours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Whitehead</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made some points that the Minister may make in response to the amendment. It attempts to look at the atmosphere within which local authorities work. I realise that I am about to suggest an intellectual or logical chain of events. If one accepts the principle of capping of any sort, but does not accept that it should be universal, and, if we assume that we will not enter into an annual charade whereby we try to create classes and rules that are clearly set up for particular purposes, there is a danger, given these legislative proposals, that an environment would be created whereby local authorities found themselves in difficulty about how to ensure that they worked well in their capacity as authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister, by using this method, or through protocol—which we know has already begun to work well in discussions with the Local Government Association—or by enunciating in discussion with local authorities how the atmosphere may develop, will be able to ensure that authorities do not reach a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0996">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
position in which they apparently work well but become fearful that, on account of the effect of standard spending assessments, they may find themselves subject to capping. That would not be a particularly good way to proceed towards the partnership that I said was essential for a good relationship between local government and the centre in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that some way forward should be found. The amendment suggests ways in which that might be done, but there are other ways. I offer the amendment to the Committee for consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and others which would mitigate the extraordinary powers in the schedule. In my view, there is a real danger of the provisions being a hammer blow to local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party's manifesto, to which I have referred previously, states clearly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local decision making should be less constrained by central government, and also more accountable to local people."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister has many things to do at weekends, so she may not have read the 
	<i>Oswestry and Border Counties Advertiser.</i> Had she done so, she would have realised the impact of her Government's policy on people who have worked in local government for many years. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Oswestry Borough Council looks set for its biggest shake-up in decades, with a third of its councillors—some long serving members—deciding they will not stand for re-election in May. Disillusionment with the local government system…"</p></blockquote>
is one of the main reasons. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"County stalwart Trevor Davies of Oswestry, another former borough mayor, said that he was too disillusioned with local government. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>'It's 41 years ago since I was first elected and it is doubtful that I will stand for re-election.'"</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>

	<i>[Interruption.]</i> This is the important phrase. The Minister laughs, but the people of Oswestry are not laughing about it. Mr. Davis continued
	<br><blockquote><p>'Local government is now just an administrative arm of the government … Now we cannot do anything—we are just told what to do and how to do it.'"</p></blockquote>
That is exactly what the schedule is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The country was led to believe last year that power would be handed back to the people. I want councillors to be able to satnd for election, presenting to the electors a programme with a price, with councillors returning to the ballot four years later, having either delivered their programme, and offered cheaper local taxes, or failed. That should be the criterion to avoid the huge bureaucracy of which we complain.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned four years as a suitable period for a councillor to present a programme, put it into action and present his record to the electorate. Yet under the schedule, the cost of whatever programme a councillor of any party presents to the local electorate is irrelevant. It depends rather on the capricious arbitrary powers and subjective judgment of the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule is ludicrous. Paragraph 52B gives the Secretary of State any power to take any action on any criteria. There is no reference to local people or local issues—quite the opposite of what was promised in the general election. More recently, after they had assumed power, the Government stated in paragraph 1.36 of the Welsh White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a need for improvements in the local accountability for levels of council tax."</p></blockquote>
Here we are discussing a schedule that centralises decision making and provides no criteria relating to which way the Secretary of State may like to jump. That makes it impossible to prepare a case beforehand.

When I intervened briefly on my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, I mentioned that this was a particular problem in Wales because there is a political dimension. As my hon. Friend said, the Welsh Assembly will be not only an executive body distributing central funds, in the same way as the Secretary of State in England, but a highly political body. We all saw the political excitement over the

	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
weekend and I have to say that some of us were brought up to believe that 64 per cent, was a larger number than 36 per cent.—but were proved wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be the most extraordinary shenanigans in the Welsh Assembly and there is a strong chance that the capricious and arbitrary powers delegated to the Secretary of State will be misused. That is a tragedy for Wales, just after the unitary system has been set up. There seemed to be a real chance for local government to flourish on the basis of direct local accountability and only one tier, but all that will be destroyed and a huge second tier imposed with dramatic powers to overrule local decision and local choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 206, 208 and 209 go some way to ameliorating this extraordinary schedule, which contradicts everything that we were told in the election campaign and in the White Papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever I am reflecting on PR, I recall that the most recent German election is the first in the post-war period in which the Government changed as a result of the election. We need to recognise that there is no such thing as a universal panacea for accountability or voter involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, who is no longer here but I see that his amendment partner is. I wish to disabuse him of two points that he made repeatedly—they are happy little myths that are simply not true. The first is that capping criteria had to be set in advance. No one asked, "Who are we going to catch this year? How do we define it to catch a particular local authority?" That would have led straight to judicial review. The world is not like that. People are happy to have that conspiratorial view, but the world does not play in those terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Keeble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the criteria for capping were not made public until a number of authorities, including the one I led, challenged on the point and got the requirement that the criteria should be made public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the time that I held that ministerial post we had to announce our capping criteria in advance, which seemed perfectly reasonable. This year the Government said that they retained the legislation but announced no capping criteria. They still had the ability to cap this year so the hon. Lady should be careful before she deploys that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns the methodology. There was a massive consultation exercise every year. The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) will be familiar with the SSA working party, for example. The problem is that local government does not agree among itself. That is quite understandable. The interests of one local authority do not coincide with those of another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take our famous area cost adjustment, with which you will be familiar, Mr O'Brien. Some local authorities do not want to change it but others do. Your local authority was a member of the Webber Craig group which is a band of local authorities in Lancashire and Yorkshire that wanted certain things
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
to happen in the SSAs which did not suit others. There is always a choice to be made. Ministers do not sit down to work out how to manipulate things. As for day visitors, York, Chester and some of the seaside towns were all anxious to get recognition of the additional pressure on services which large influxes of visitors brought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist drawing to my right hon. Friend's attention paragraph 5.7 of the White Paper under the heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"Abolition of crude and universal capping"</p></blockquote>
which must be of interest to the hon. Member for Northampton, North. The Government are making a virtue of the fact that local authorities will not be notified in advance of capping criteria. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government will not in advance tell every single council in the country how much it may spend."</p></blockquote>
That was a travesty of the publication of capping criteria, but it is now under these proposals that the Government will cap authorities retrospectively after they have set their budgets, blind to the principles by which the Secretary of State might set capping criteria 
	<i>[Interruption].</i> The hon. Lady says that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me some respite care during my speech. The hon. Lady's amendment shows how good intentions do not always make good legislation. The problem is one of definition. What I like about the amendment is that it tries to firm up paragraph 52B(2) which is the catch-all phrase. Some of the principles that the Secretary of State will have to consider are in the Bill, some are not. I am sure that when we come to consider the schedule as a whole we will want to ask the Minister to be a little clearer about that. That is the real area of debate on the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other factors that come into account all present their difficulties. Best value makes sense ostensibly, but it is a continuing process. The whole thrust of the Bill is to say that best value and the three Es should be a normal condition. We should be careful before we establish it as a reward for a particular set of incentives or special privileges for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Support of the local electorate was mentioned. I believe that the local electorate should express its views through the ballot box. I am not a great fan of local referendums because of the difficulty in defining the question and the choices that are put before the electorate. I am not a great fan of the Milton Keynes experiment, nor is Sir Jeremy Beecham, judging from his appearance on local television about that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If beacon status existed, how would councils that had done particularly well be rewarded? All Governments have wrestled with that question. Can an incentive system be built into local government? That is very difficult, as everyone wants an incentive to spend more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, local authorities will become beacons or best value authorities by demonstrating that they do not need to spend more. They will achieve the best-quality service from money that they already have.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0998">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>485</span>
Therefore, one must be careful about building into the system a mechanism for making authorities want to spend more and for rewarding them financially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eventually, all local authorities may become beacon authorities. However, beacon status may be withdrawn from authorities that slip below the mark. It will be more difficult for local authorities to remain beacon authorities because getting closer to the top of the scale makes it harder to squeeze out the extra percentage needed to maintain a relative position in the scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools are discovering that in relation to the league tables. They may get well up the tables, but getting the bit extra that takes them up another couple of points is more difficult and may be affected by kids being ill or on holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 197 is useful because it invites the Minister to explain the principles behind the measure and why some appear in the Bill and some do not. The amendment is a good try and has good intentions, but it is a bad measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Milton Keynes has been mentioned, so I will give the result of the referendum. Forty-five per cent, of the people of Milton Keynes voted in the referendum. That figure is higher than any turnout for a local election. The highest turnout for such an election was 41 per cent., which occurred during the year that the poll tax was an issue. Last year's local election turnout was 26 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the referendum, 30 per cent, of voters voted for a 5 per cent, increase in council tax, 46 per cent, voted for a 9.8 per cent, increase, and 23 per cent, voted for a 15 per cent, increase. I appreciate that the Minister cannot take such information into account this year. However, Milton Keynes council has always been innovative, and undertook the referendum as part of a continuing process of modernisation. Discussions about local government finance may be progressed by such methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of local government's problems is that it has wanted one solution to fit all. Diversity is the key to local government, and different local authorities require different solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, in any future referendum of that nature, the local authority would have to set out the proposed council tax increase and the proposed supplement to be paid in respect of knock-on effects on council tax benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was done. The Electoral Reform Society conducted the ballot and ensured that it was fair. It provided a pack that the local authority used to explain both the effect of every option on a band D council tax payer and the impact on services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the issue of what questions to ask was raised. It was difficult for the local authority to ask the right question. It may not have got the question right. However, it made a very good attempt, which it should continue next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
The referendum posed fundamental questions about the nature of local government finance. The schedule does something similar. When the Secretary of State considers such matters, he must appraise the nature of the question and the nature of support that people give. In Milton Keynes, 70 per cent, of voters said that they wanted an increase of 9 per cent, or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capping has a most pernicious effect on a local authority. Such an effect does not last for one year only, but lingers on. A council that has been capped never wants to repeat the experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plenty did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point, but many councils were capped time and again because the rules changed. For example, we were capped in 1991, when we introduced an increase that was one third of the previous year's increase. In the previous year, the authority had been run by a Tory-Liberal coalition and had introduced an increase of 25 per cent. We introduced a rise of 8 per cent, and got capped. The only change was that we were in control. We introduced a smaller increase and got capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that, while capping is intended to be less overt under the new arrangements, the regime will loom over every local authority? The White Paper makes it clear that local authorities that step out of line will be capped. Although the schedule grants only reserve powers, they threaten every local authority. Therefore, the pernicious effect that the hon. Gentleman describes remains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. The year after our local authority was capped, some members of the group presented a proposal for introducing a council tax rise of 30 per cent, to challenge the Government. That was a political proposal, which was defeated in the group. The reserve powers are valid for dealing with such proposals. The current crude and universal capping causes problems for all authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman explains how he believes that the powers will be used. He is not talking about the Bill's contents. The Bill's provisions are broader and more subjective than those of any other measure. The four reserve powers can be designated in-year, as currently happens, but they can also be designated for the following year. A notional budget can be set and designated for an authority for several years. Those provisions are more powerful and subjective than the current system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the Bill. However, the current system causes the problems that I described. They apply to all local authorities. It is good that the reserve powers can apply to individual authorities, and take account of the circumstances. The current universal capping criteria had perverse effects. Every local authority spent up to the maximum. Those that did not do that lost out. That provided a perverse
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I0999">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
incentive. Some authorities, such as Slough, which was a low-spending Labour authority, spent up to the maximum to benefit from a system under which it had previously lost out. The Bill removes that perversity and allows councils to set a council tax that is appropriate to their budges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the current system and the SSA cap, councils could make cuts and introduce a council tax reduction. Liberal Democrats criticised me for doing that in the run-up to the general election. However, the effect of the year's settlement was that we had a council tax reduction at the same time as we made £12 million worth of cuts. No one could understand it locally. Again, the new system means that such issues can be recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can that be recognised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Welsh party in exile. But the problem is that when a whole class of authorities is considered, the individual circumstances of local authorities are not taken into account. The reserve powers enable the Secretary of State to do that and to deal with an individual authority. That can help matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where does it say that in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman read out the criteria earlier on. I am sure that he can use his intelligence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman's point. The Secretary of State could go down those lines if he wished, but there is nothing in the Bill to say that he must and he could go down any other line. The honorary Gentleman's problem is that he is seeing it in a benevolent way. He has a Secretary of State whom he believes in for the moment—touch wood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This needs to be seen in the context of the innovations in local government. The best value proposals and the limited use of reserve powers is the way it should go forward. The hon. Gentleman seems to argue that I should worry because there might one day be a Tory Secretary of State. Well, I would be worried about that, but it is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future. The Bill allows local government, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test pointed out, to come out of the shadow of the past 18 years and to start to show that best value can work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In which case, why does he think that swathes of local councillors of all parties have given up in Oswestry? It is because they are fed up with the central Government interference in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. White</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The point is that the Opposition amendments would offer the worst parts of the current system without the benefits of the use of reserve powers and the abolition of crude and universal capping, which would return through the back door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate with a lot of the contradictions in the Conservative party coming out. I want to respond to some of the general points that have been made but I also want to deal with the specific amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 206 seeks to provide that where a council's band D council tax is less than the average for authorities of the same class, its budget requirement cannot be considered excessive. We should call this the Mole Valley amendment or perhaps the Mole Valley previous incarnation amendment. I am surprised that hon. Members have proposed it. They did not consider that such a restriction was necessary when they were operating the current inflexible capping system and it is interesting that they wish to put it into anything new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made it clear that there is a national responsibility and a national interest in representing and protecting local council tax payers from excessive council tax increases. Hon. Members shook their heads at the last points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. The reality is that some authorities have few households in band D.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of households are in band A, therefore the increase in council tax in band D in a particular authority will not be commensurate with the increase in the budget because most of the rise will come from band A taxpayers. The way in which the previous Government sought to use that average led to misunderstanding about how council tax operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister. Earlier, she reiterated the point that the Government must protect council tax payers from excessive tax rises. Why does the Government not consider it necessary to protect local residents from cuts to services because the council tax cannot be increased? Surely, that should be borne in mind too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman at last understands that the Bill is about ensuring that residents get the very best quality of service at a price that local people are prepared to pay. There will be symmetry; a relationship between the two. At the moment there is a disjuncture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) was not here when we discussed the problem of removing capping altogether. His hon. Friend the Member for North Essex and his right hon. Friend the leader of the Conservative party, acknowledged in recent speeches that difficult issues are involved. An authority that has been mentioned previously reduced its council tax by 35 per cent, last year; that may have had nothing to do with the fact that it was facing the electorate. It is alleged to be thinking about putting its council tax up this year by 40 per cent. I may be cynical, but I think it may have something to do with the fact that it will not face the electorate for another three years. In such circumstances, the Government have a responsibility to protect the taxpayer. In normal circumstances, I think the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is not a fair way to treat council tax payers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1000">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
I am not making any comment about Government decisions this year; I am giving examples of what happens when council tax finance is considered separately from the rest of the Government's modernisation programme. As my hon. Friends said, the Bill establishes a new relationship between central and local government. It is part of a series of measures that will, if successful, mean that no Secreatary of State can do what the hon. Member for Mole Valley and his Secretary of State did under the previous Administration. Because local government will be more powerful, and local people will give it legitimacy, no Government will dare to intervene in that way. The Bill is part of a package which shifts the balance towards a partnership which will encourage the better performing councils. That is for future measures, so I cannot say much about it now, but I hope that Opposition Members will acknowledge that they cannot consider the Bill in isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand some of the fears of Opposition Members, because they exercised draconian powers. The hon. Member for Mole Valley and the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon know that under the current legislation it is not necessary to pre-announce criteria. Indeed, it is entirely up to the Government to decide on criteria and when they will be announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In opposition and in government I have met representatives of several authorities which faced capping. Almost every one spoke about budgets in previous years, as well as those in the current year. They all asked for the pattern of events since the poll tax, and how their particular budgets had been affected by it, to be taken into account. Some made the sort of arguments alluded to earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East when he spoke about his reorganised authority. Milton Keynes was in a peculiar position regarding council tax and budget decisions. The schedule has been framed because it is important for council's arguments to be taken into account. I shall return to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Mole Valley will recognise that amendment No. 206 will not help the Bill and will not enable what he intended actually to happen. It may protect one or two councils in their current position, but that is not a means of legislating for the future. I hope that hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that and withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in proposing the amendments, I wanted to point out the subjectivity of the provisions and ask the Minister not to accept the amendments word for word but to take the point, which was about the draconian nature of the powers. We are asked to take the Minister's intentions on faith, but we cannot do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from given the way in which his Government acted. However, we are taking the relationship with local government on faith and trust. We want a trustworthy relationship between central
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
and local government—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I want to answer the hon. Gentleman's question fully. That is why we seek to strengthen local government through the raft of modernisation measures that we outline in the White Paper. We need reserve powers to that we can have confidence in the steps that local government itself will take to ensure that the reserve powers will never need to be applied. The various moves and shifts referred to in the White Paper will mean that it will not be necessary to use the reserve powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I understand where the hon. Member for Mole Valley is coming from, but I come from a different position—one that wants a vibrant local government with strength and accountability, as a result of which it will not see itself as in battle with the Government, or take the sort of decisions mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. The LGA believes that under the previous capping regime many authorities simply sought to spend at cap. I have visited several authorities that have said: "We do not debate what we ought to be doing; we simply set out budget at cap. If we do not do that, we lose out next year anyway".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is ludicrous and is a negative effect of the previous Administration's implementation of the existing measure. We want to move away from that, which is why we are examining more flexible powers which, I believe, will be used far less. Local government will take hold of its own destiny, and will work towards that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The penultimate sentence emphasises that difficulty that many Committee members are experiencing. The Minister used the phrase "I believe". However, we have only the Bill to go on, and we must discuss it for the sake of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with many of the Minister's intentions and agree that local authorities with a distinct lack of imagination set their budgets at cap. However, the schedule is draconian in its selection of any information or factor that the Secretary of State may deem to be relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has now made that point four times, but has not said anything new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in control of local government, nor do I seek that control. I am talking about a relationship, and any relationship must involve faith and trust. I am not prepared to move in the direction desired by the hon. Gentleman and spell out everything in the Bill. That will give central Government levels of determinate control that are far greater than those in the bill, once such powers are put in the context of everything else that we want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The LGA—and not the Conservative party—has made a plea. The LGA's preference is for all the key principles to be set out in the Bill. Why cannot the Minister satisfy local authorities on that matter? Her own proclivity is to acquire more power for the Secretary of State at local authorities' expense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that I was wrong to give way. The hon. Gentleman is referring to amendments that I will address later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 may be intended to complement amendment No. 206 by seeking to remove the powers of the Secretary of State or the Welsh Assembly to determine categories of authorities for which different sets of principles will apply. The amendments propose classes of authorities to which all sets of principles apply, but they do not define those classes. I can only assume that the classes are those in current capping legislation; that is, non-metropolitan districts, counties, metropolitan districts, unitary authorities, inner London boroughs, outer London boroughs and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked why the LGA was excluded. It has not been excluded, as it would happily fit into a category, but not a class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before that one reason for introducing reserve powers is to increase flexibility. We have explained in the local government White Papers that the new reserve powers will enable us to set no limits on councils meeting certain criteria. Examples might be those whose council tax is only a small proportion of the total council tax bill faced by local tax payers or those that provide particular services. Other examples might include councils that have shown strong performance in the delivery of best value or that have the support of their electorate. That would not be possible if the Secretary of State could not determine categories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All district authorities in shire areas have council taxes which are a small proportion of the total council tax bill faced by tax payers. Does that mean that all district councils in shire county areas will be exempt?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows that I was saying that we would be able to make that decision where the current legislation is quite restrictive. Some shire districts are not in that position whereas the vast majority are. The clause would enable us to make precisely that decision. That is not to say that it has been decided that the selection would be made. I am simply giving that as the sort of example that we could move to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not focus on classes of authority as defined in the current capping legislation. There are significant differences between local authorities in any such class, not least in the level of budget set and the services provided. It is much more sensible to
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
determine categories that will enable us to take into account all the circumstances that may arise in future such as those categories that I have just outlined. That is one of the reasons for not setting everything out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are living in a rapidly changing environment. Local government is changing too. We would not want to have to come back to primary legislation every time there was a slight change. I accept that there is a difference between us and the official Opposition on the need for flexibility. That is because of the different ways in which we see the relationship. I understand that the Liberal Democrats would like flexibility but do not want any capping. I understand their position but the Conservative position is much more confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 197, which was tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Southampton, Test and for Castle Point, seeks to set out in the Bill some of the principles and categories of authorities that may be used when deciding whether budget requirements are accepted. I assure my hon. Friends that it is unnecessary. The amendment suggests that local authorities with budgets below a specified level or which provide particular services may be exempted. Section 52B as drafted already provides for that; it allows the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to determine categories of authorities taking into account any information considered relevant. Therefore if some small districts were at a level where it was simply not effective to cap them, that could be a category that would be determined. But it is also the same with the factors put forward by the amendment. The Secretary of State or the Assembly will be able to determine principles and categories to take into account all those factors and again there is no need to include them in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As yet there is no statutory basis for those factors although I am keen for us to have a debate in the House on legislation to introduce those measures. As I explained in response to the Opposition amendments, one of the reasons for replacing crude and universal capping with the reserve powers is to increase flexibility. It is important that the reserve powers can be used to respond—to changing circumstances in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, local government will be widely reformed and modernised in the next few years. It is not possible to predict the exact way in which the Government may need to use the reserve powers in future. As I said to my hon. Friends, I hope that we shall not have to use them. However, we do not want to risk restricting the powers only to find that to designate a few irresponsible councils we are forced to designate others that we do not want to affect.

My hon. Friends and Members for Southampton, Test and for Milton Keynes, North-East presented a powerful case to show that the blanket imposition of capping sometimes had ridiculous, unjustified effects that were incomprehensible locally. Our desire to ensure that the majority of councils do not worry about being capped because they are in charge, accountable and responsible to their electorate led to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1002">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
the measure. We do not pretend that every local authority is as bad as the worst local authority. The measure should enable the best to flourish and not be brought down, if only in reputation, by the few who behave irresponsibly. That is why the schedule is framed in a particular way. I hope that my hon. Friends will not press their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already introduced one change. However, the current capping legislation is far too restrictive, and does not allow us to reflect the changes in the way in which we operate this year. We have stabilised the SSAs for three years and thus provided more stability in financial planning for local authorities. That shows that we can consider more than one year and that we can tell a local authority that it is running into trouble, give it notice this year, and assure it that it will not get into trouble if it sorts out the problems next year. There have been several occasions when we knew that we would not have had to impose capping if we had been able to negotiate in that way. We could have had a sensible discussion and come to an agreement with an authority after we had notified it clearly of the criteria on which we based our judgment. That would have enabled it to put its house in order in the next year without incurring billing. That seems sensible rather than draconian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To quote Milton, the Minister makes
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the worse appear the better reason."</p></blockquote>
We are not considering a premeditated halt for local authorities to reflect. The Government could not find an answer to the area cost adjustment any more than we could. Therefore, they intend to call it off, and it will be subsumed in some greater review. Pauses are smashing if one is in a good position, but people who are in a bad position do not like them. Some local authorities will believe that the pause constitutes a marvellous opportunity for long-term planning while others, such as north Yorkshire, will feel that they are being taken to the cleaners for the next three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have put across the point that we have been trying to make. The Minister accepts that the Bill proposes capping, potentially in four different forms. I have some sympathy for her. She used the term "national issue", and said that under the way in which local government finance is structured at the moment—that is the caveat—there may be cases where the Government need to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point behind the amendments is that the Committee is examining the Bill: we cannot look at the back of the Minister's head or guess her dreams. We do not know whether she wakes up and thinks, "I am going to do such and such for local government; it is going to be wonderful; and everyone is going to follow our line." We are examining this Bill, which is horrendously subjective. I accept some of her arguments and acknowledged at the start that at least two of the amendments would require changes in the wording. I said that the amendments were about making some important points. One amendment would take some provisions out of the Bill. The blatant
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
point is that the Secretary of State—no matter what the Minister's dreams for local government—can be draconian and subjective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued that the local authority to which the Minister referred visited the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford) to discuss its situation. The Minister's point was made by the Minister of State to that authority—namely that year-in, year-out, the council tax was kept down and savings were made, especially in the year before the election. It went up straight afterwards. I do not know whether that is fact or fiction. However, I do know that that local authority has been under Conservative control since 1978 and that it has a huge majority—so the public have backed its approach. The Minister must understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the schedule, the Secretary of State could pick out that local authority because it started with the letter "W" and ended in "th"—or anything that he judges relevant. The debate on this issue must continue. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 207, in page 17, line 33, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) the Secretary of State shall publish a statement of the set of principles for each financial year on or before 31st December in the preceding year".</p></blockquote>
I had hoped to speak to the amendment on Thursday: it is a shame that we have so little time now. The amendment follows on from this afternoon's debate. It would reinforce the need for the Secretary of State to publish his set of principles. Without publication of the information, local authorities would be left in the dark. We have heard considerable anxiety about how benign any future Secretary of State might be in interpreting these subjective powers, which makes publication all the more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where would councils be left as the Bill stands? The Secretary of State is to inform them that his prediction for council tax increases is in the order 4.5 per cent. We heard that during the revenue support grant debate. However, proposed council tax increases published in 
	<i>The Times</i> on 20 February showed a wide variation. It is perhaps not surprising, regarding the proposed county settlement, that Labour-controlled Cumbria and Durham remain within the Secretary of State's predictions. But what of those councils who face double, treble or quadruple rises in council tax? Where will they be left unless the set of principles is published? As I said, they will be left in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two councils that have doubled the predicted council tax increase—Kent and Hampshire—are Conservative controlled, but Northamptonshire, which is in Labour control, has an 8.8 per cent, projected increase. Northumberland's is 9.5 per cent, and in Nottinghamshire, it is 9.9 per cent. Those are Labour-controlled councils but they too are left in the dark without a published set of principles relating to whether they will be hit by the reserve powers. In truth, that says more about the winners and losers in the calculation of revenue support grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V004P0I1003">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
What set of principles will be used to assess Oxfordshire, which will have an 11.8 per cent, increase, or Buckinghamshire, with a 13.3 per cent, increase. We cannot help wondering whether the pioneering Wandsworth is trying to test the system, with its proposed 22.2 per cent, increase. Where will the axe fall? Without a published set of principles the authorities are left totally in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment seeks to bring about publication of the figures. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex referred to the position of the Local Government Association which is clear. It is a strong cross-party voice that calls loudly for the key principles to be set out in the Bill, and for publication. It is concerned that without that, the powers will be left entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State. For that reason we urge the Minister to reflect on the need to publish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We receive new documentation this morning. On entering the Committee Room I discovered that another new document, on the reserve powers, had been presented to the Committee. I read it carefully during the Committee's proceedings—unlike this morning's procedure, there was no suspension to enable the Committee to read documents—but nowhere can I find a reference to the need to publish this set of principles. Therefore I remain convinced of the need for this information to be published. If it is not, local authorities will be unclear about where the limit—the new word to be used in place of capping—will come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to point out that during discussion of schedule 1, my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon made it clear that during his time in office capping criteria were published. There is therefore a precedent for publishing this information—another important point to put on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that at least hon. Members sitting behind the Minister will understand what we are trying to get at, and why. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East gives a smile of affirmation, so I assume that he understands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon and I were in the Department, we recognised that, within reason, local authorities needed to know where they were as soon as possible. The crux of our amendment is that it attempts to persuade the Government to recognise that, and to ensure that local authorities have some understanding of where they are, so as to cut down surprises and give them the opportunity and sufficient time to take the detail into consideration in their budgets—which they should to some degree have done anyway, although many authorities leave this till the last minute. This would give them time to assess whether to introduce savings, change their method of approach, take some products off their wish list, use a bit of competitive tendering instead of just using the direct labour force alone. They could recognise a combination of quality of service and so on by these principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of this derives from the anticipation, preempted by amendment No. 197, that there may be other types of authority—beacon authorities were mentioned—and a question arose about whether local authorities should take a few Blairisms or some political correctness from the back of the White Paper on beacon councils and follow that line as it would make for a more benevolent approach towards a particular local authority. Authorities need to know far enough in advance that they have this in their hands. Hence the amendment, which chooses 31 December as the date by which the Secretary of State must publish the statement of the set of principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
