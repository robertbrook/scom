	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to note that there are probably more amendments to this clause than to the rest of the Bill put together. There must be a lesson in that, but I'm hanged if I know what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three themes run through the amendments. First, why should there be a change? Amendment No. 190 will allow us to discuss that. Secondly, will the persons to whom those powers are entrusted be suitable and adequate, and what safeguards do we have? Thirdly, to whom, other than the Secretary of State and the service, will the new service be answerable for standards and quality? I want to introduce those three themes. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) will catch your eye, Mr. Knox, and develop them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear to the Opposition that the purpose of the clause is to privatise the careers service—to jeopardise training, education and careers advice for a vulnerable group. That is partly to pave the way for the abolition of local education authorities with the progress of the grant-maintained schools. That is the not-too-hidden agenda which the Minister, when he tells us that we have had an interesting debate and that many points have been raised, will dress up with excuses about efficiency, flexibility and local accountability. Every time that I hear those words I know that the reality will be the opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office, in a consultation exercise in 1992, acknowledged from the start that the careers system, as constituted, functions extremely well and that there are few problems with it. The Department of Employment's internal review—the Bruce review—generally supported the careers service. It is regrettable that the results of that review were never published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some partnerships are developing in careers services along lines suggested by various individuals and they are beneficial. It is not necessary to legislate to develop that part of the careers service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this clause is draconian and is intended to mess up the service from top to bottom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local education authorities in England and education authorities in Scotland, as constituted, provide a valuable and useful function. The clause is not necessary. As constituted, the careers service is an essential client-orientated service. We fear that the clause would lead to the loss of that purely client-orientated service. The careers service is not a citizens advice bureau—somewhere people go when they have problems—but the first place people go to get good careers advice which should prevent future problems. It gives advice and guidance at the start of their careers. Therefore, the responsible body must be able to gain access to school curricula at an early stage and to plan them jointly with teachers of a range of subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that the careers service might be an aid to recruitment for employers but that it is not a recruitment agency per se. That distinction is important. The problem with some of the Bill's provisions is that there will be a conflict of opinion, particularly if local enterprise companies and training and enterprise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
councils become involved and the careers advice service becomes a method for filling the requisite number of places in the LEC or TEC provisions. That must not happen. That is not the function of a careers service. The function is to supply careers advice, not to act as a recruitment agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without that conflict of interest, the careers service offers impartial advice with no vested interest in favour of a certain educational establishment, training organisation or employer. It can assess a comprehensive range of information provided by the school or college on the ability, character and ambitions of each client, and it develops close links with schools and staff and with employers in various other organisations. The careers service provides a service that is tailored to individuals' needs and provides them with a client-orientated service, which is in the best interests of the individual. There is no conflict of interest. The careers service is not an employment agency. That is the most important theme in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are all on the same basis. They delete reference to "other persons" or introduce qualifying adjectives for those other persons so that they are able to provide simple vocational and educational guidance. We want to ensure that the careers service is not ripped off in the TECs and the LECs by inexperienced cowboys who are handed taxpayers' money which goes down a black hole and provides nothing. We do not want that to happen. We want to ensure that, when the Secretary of State takes the powers, they are given to qualified, experienced people who are accepted in the community and who have the confidence of all involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ensure that that happens, monitoring and assessment will be necessary. That is dealt with in amendments Nos. 252 and 208, which mention a statutory body to implement those provisions. A person or body, other than the Secretary of State, must be answerable for what happens. That person or body cannot be a cowboy who has set up as a careers service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main aims of the amendments. The Bill provides for the privatisation of the careers service and a paving clause to make easier the abolition of LEAs. We are opposed to the clause and want to amend it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to concentrate on amendments Nos. 245 and 248, which are crucial to achieving an amelioration of the more draconian aspects of the clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said, the clause centralises power and gives total discretion to the Secretary of State in a way that is shocking to behold. We are trying, through the amendments, to surround the clause with checks and balances to insure that the outcome causes as little damage as possible to careers structures which already exist and which are begining to do a good job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to spend a little time considering what good careers guidance is about, how it has been supplied in the past, and the implications of the clause. Local education authorities currently have a statutory duty to provide a careers service for pupils and all those in higher education in their areas. That is set out in sections 8 to 10 of the Employment and Training Act 1973. Until now, therefore, the careers service has been run as an integral
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
part of local education authority provision. However, as discussions are taking place in other Committees about changing structures of local authorities and education provision, one suspects that changes in the structure of local education authorities are being anticipated and that the Government are attempting to create a system that will fit into a new model of opted-out schools and the fracturing of our education system. There are problems with that approach and some dangers, which I shall discuss later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The careers service has run reasonably successfully as part of the integrated local authority provision, although, in 1990, the Government announced a review and, in 1991, published a consultation document which suggested three possible ways forward. Completely out of the blue, they said that the status quo was no option because "times have changed." Clearly, the Government think that the status quo is no option, and three options were proposed as possible models on which to develop future careers guidance. The first option was that TECs should have full responsibility. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden highlighted one of the dangers of following that course; that TECs would act as recruiting agencies to fill jobs rather than pursue the real aims of careers guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second option was education business partnerships between local education authorities and TECs. In fact, since that consultation document was issued, several successful partnerships have begun to develop. The people who have put much work and commitment into those partnerships were commended by a Government document evaluating the initiative on careers service partnerships. Those same people have been shocked to discover the contents of clause 33, which appears to throw away all that work and take the third option mentioned in the original paper—contracting out to competitive tender. We share their anxiety that that is the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is so short and provides so few safeguards that we are worried about the system that will result from privatisation. Amendments Nos. 245,247,248,250 and 251 would help to ensure local accountability of the new service-providers to teachers, to educational establishments in which they may have to spend some time operating, to clients and to the local community. Other amendments would ensure that only fit persons were allowed to offer such advice and would establish monitoring mechanisms aimed at keeping quality high. It is important that we have those monitoring systems because careers guidance should play an important part in the development of children and young adults. Those systems should ensure that they not only get the most out of the choices that are offered to them but go to places where they will be happiest and most effective. It is a complex issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of careers guidance is to help individuals to make wise decisions when they plan or develop a career. The labour market is increasingly complex, with a plethora of qualifications and training institutions. An individual who has to make such decisions should have some professional careers advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Careers guidance also enables individuals to choose and plan their path through life. An important phrase that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0733">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
I have come across in my consideration of this matter is that careers guidance enables young people to unlock their potential. That is very different from filling empty jobs or acting as a recruitment agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When properly done, careers guidance serves as an enabling process that allows individuals to have their eyes lifted to wider horizons. They can have a path plotted for them so that they can obtain what they want. Unprofessional, bad careers advice narrows people's horizons, lowers their expectations and merely slots people into convenient places. The careers guidance that the Opposition support would have to raise people's expectations, increase their awareness of what is available to them, and open their eyes to wider horizons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that careers advice is professional and impartial, so that when people sit opposite careers advisers they are not pushed into doing one thing or categorised as factory people or people who can fit into a certain slot. People should be given an appropriate chance to have a proper dialogue with an impartial adviser, who can open their eyes to careers that they may not have considered and ensure that they get the most out of the process. It should be a two-way process. It should not involve the adviser saying, "Well, there are vacancies down the road. Why don't you apply there?" The process should involve much more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When careers advice is good, it is very good and when it is bad it is horrid. The Opposition want to ensure that the service that is provided—unless the Government have had a sudden change of heart and want to withdraw the clause due to the strength of our arguments—can guarantee quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other aspects in which careers advice is particularly important. I feel particularly strongly that there should be equal opportunities for women, black people and those with disabilities. Careers advisers must have the right training to overcome stereotyped views of any groups with particular problems in society. We have had discussions with the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, which have expressed particular concerns about quality and access to the post-privatised careers guidance system, partly because they are acutely aware that, unless proper training is given, professional advisers at the coal face may be labouring under out-of-date or unjustified assumptions about the capabilities of the people in front of them. The same could be said of a woman who might want to go into a non-traditional area of work as of someone with profound deafness, who may have a certain aspiration that a badly trained or untrained adviser might consider beyond his or her capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to ensure equal opportunities, and such an aspiration is part of good careers guidance. Those who are face to face with children and young people must be aware of those issues and be properly trained to give correct, impartial advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 245 aims to ensure local acceptability and accountability of the new careers services. It is essential that any new service is acceptable to the local community. If they are to operate effectively, the careers services must be trusted as impartial and professional and as offering advice of a high standard by the local people in educational establishments such as TECs, schools or colleges, by parents and by others who may use the service. Without that trust, there will be creeping worries that
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
people are being directed to jobs for the convenience of a local employer. Such problems must be erased. That trust, local acceptability and accountability impinge on amendment No. 248.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the new owners or suppliers of careers services should be accountable to local interests for the work that they do. We must ensure that a reasonable monitoring service accompanies the work so that if a careers service begins to run off the rails or to behave in a way with which local stake holders—for want of a better word—disagree, it can be pulled back and called to account. In other words, the show should be kept on the road and must not run off at a tangent, which might not meet local people's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 245 also states that the Secretary of State must specify in advance the criteria for being a fit person to run a careers service. The clause allows any Tom, Dick or Harry to set up a careers service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or Harriet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, although I suspect that it would be Tom, Dick or Harry. However, in the interests of complete equality, any Tom, Dick or Harriet could set up as a careers adviser and bid to provide the services. We want an assurance from Conservative Members and the Government that high standards will be expected of anyone who plans to bid for that important role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 245 should be taken in tandem with amendment No. 248, which attempts to establish broadly based partnerships throughout the country. Amendment No. 248 aims to build on some of the best practices that have emerged from partnerships that have been established since 1981. By all accounts, there has been a fairly steep learning curve in those partnerships. All the good practice developed by the enthusiastic work of some of the participants in those partnerships must not be thrown away and the partnerships abandoned for a competitive tendering process, from which local authorities would be excluded. A completely new system would have to grow up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Gloucestershire, a successful partnership has developed that comprises a small number of representatives who have been nominated by the local TEC and the local education authority. The board has a broad membership: three representatives from the TEC, three from the local education authority, a secondary head teacher and the principal of a college of further education. That is a good mix from the institutions that are responsible for providing education and work experience, which is increasingly becoming part of careers guidance. Work experience enables pupils to have experience of working in a particular job before leaving school. It would be sad in the extreme were this type of work to be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us about the Government's intentions regarding those partnerships? Will they survive, or will they have to turn in to commercial operations so that they can bid for the right to continue to provide their advice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important aspect of such a partnership is that it involves at board level, and in all its decision-making processes, the local authority and the LEA. The opposition believe that that local involvement and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
accountability are essential if the careers guidance service is to be respected by the clients, their parents and the educational establishments that provide the opportunity for it to flourish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 250 would make it obligatory to employ staff who are competent to perform the necessary duties. It ties in with some of the concerns that organisations have about the protection of people with special needs of various kinds—people with disabilities for example. It seems to me to be incontestable that those who are to be asked to provide such an important service should be competent to perform the necessary duties. Young people at school have access only once to effective careers advice. If the advice is wrong at that stage, it is economically inefficient. Individuals realise that they have made the wrong choice, they drop out of courses or training and they have to pick up the pieces and start again. The advice should maximise their chances of getting a job and a role in life with which they feel happy. Proper advice can be given within a crucial period of only a few years. The Opposition would not like the chance of careers advice to be fluffed by the Government's ill-thought-out reforms, which as currently worded, do not guarantee quality. It is hard for me to believe that the Government do not expect competence from those charged with performing this duty. It should not be assumed that quality, especially in a competitive tendering situation, will result from the Government's reforms. We have to legislate to ensure quality. We must ensure that the monitoring system is sufficiently adequate to pick up any decline in quality and to act quickly to remedy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the aim of amendment No. 251 is to ensure that careers guidance is recognised as a process that involves work over several years, following an individual from early on in their time at secondary school all the way through to when they leave school at the age of 16 or 17, or go on to higher or further education. To be most effective, the careers advice service needs continuity, in just the same way as companies that are awarded television franchises should be allowed time to develop quality broadcasting and their way of working. We believe that a rapid turnover of careers services provision would be detrimental. It would be sensible to allow three years for the providers of careers services to settle in and give coherent, independent advice to people as they go through school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to support the amendments that attempt to add accountability, independence, quality and monitoring provisions to the clause. The Opposition believe that the clause, unamended, is unacceptable. It would centralise power in the hands of the Secretary of State and there would be no means of checking what was going on. It could lead to a free-for-all. We certainly support the amendments. If they are not accepted, we shall oppose the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

And, why do the Secretary of State and his Ministers think that they know better than the local authority in my county of Clywd, and all the other local authorities, how best to provide those services at local level?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments have many relevant aspects, not the least of which is the need for a major local authority input in order to maintain a high level of service to the recipients of the careers service—pupils, young adults, parents and employers. I am happy to quote, for the benefit of the hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes), something that I think was said by Lady Thatcher. If it was not said by her, it should have been. She said, "If it's not broke, why fix it?" [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am told that that was said by President Truman—I knew it was a great leader of the Western world who had gone to another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would welcome a ministerial response to the comment, "If it's not broke, why fix it?". Far be it from me to be suspicious of the Ministers, but I have a feeling that the Bill is the result more of dogma than of considered opinion. I should welcome being proved wrong about that and I should welcome the Minister enlightening the Committee on matters relevant to the clause. For example, can the Minister tell the Committee what representations he has received as part of consideration of the clause? My hon. Friends and I have not received any representations that favour a change. What representations has the Minister received that demonstrate that the careers service is not up to scratch? That is an important question. I shall be happy to give way if the Minister wants to answer it. Obviously he does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What assessment has the Minister made of the level and type of services provided by local careers services? There must be a Government assessment of what happens in the careers services out there in Great Britain plc. If there is not, why are the changes being introduced? What faults have been brought to the Minister's attention by parents, employers, pupils or young people seeking careers advice? How many letters of complaint has the Minister received in—let us be generous—the past ten years? Those are relevant questions, if the Committee is to make a fair assessment of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also welcome the Minister's opinion on why—given the age of subsidiarity and of government closer to the people—he, based in Whitehall, has a better view of how careers services function 300 miles away in my constituency in north Wales than do people in the town of Mold, two miles from where I live, where local careers services are currently based. Far be it from me to be cynical, but there must be an element of dogma. If the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
Minister cannot answer my questions satisfactorily, I shall be unable to believe that a rational assessment has been made to justify the introduction of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Careers services operate in an exemplary fashion and, particularly for young people, provide a free, impartial and professional service which meets their needs. If they did not, we, as elected representatives, would be under pressure from parents who would tell us that the service was falling down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been a Member of Parliament for only ten months, but I have had no complaints about careers services. I have had complaints about many other issues, but never about careers services. Why is the Minister introducing the changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Careers services provide parents with information, help and assistance so that they can give guidance to their children on their future careers. Let us not forget that the decisions that we make today will affect people's lives for a long time to come. Neither before nor after my election have I had any representations from parents because of their dissatisfaction with the current level of careers services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's experience summarises better than mine the experience of many hon. Members and local authorities. There is no blatantly obvious dissatisfaction. There is no boil that needs lancing. It is accepted by many that careers services provide an impartial and professional quality service which commands the respect of adults, parents, pupils and employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has there been a massive haemorrhage of employers hammering at the Department of Employment's door saying, "I'm sorry but we're having a terrible service from local careers services"? I do not think that there has. If the Minister has any examples and can produce a letter or a statement from the Confederation of British Industry or anyone else, I should welcome his reply in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister cannot find such information. If he does, I should welcome his sharing it with the Committee because we should all like to have the scales lifted from our eyes. Careers services are of direct benefit to employers and their staff. The amendments would help to strengthen, not diminish them. I emphasise that careers services, operated locally by local education authorities, are accessible. People know where they can be found and they can use them. They are free, just and accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, if careers services are not performing well they are held to account locally. If there should be a mythical barrage of complaints from unhappy residents, pupils and employers who are discontented with the careers services, they do not have to go to London to lobby the Secretary of State about them; they can go to shire hall in Mold in my constituency, or to the county halls in the constituencies of my hon. Friends, knock on the doors of their local councillors and complain about the services. In a democracy, they can vote an authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
out of office if they are especially unhappy about the careers services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know why the Minister believes that some form of subsidiarity, involving a shift of power from north Wales to London, is in the interests of local people and would make the services more accountable. This is a professional service. No Tom, Dick, Harry, or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey mentioned earlier, Harriet, can set himself or herself up as a careers officer. It requires a mite of training. Do we expect doctors services to be provided by anyone who fancies calling himself a doctor? Would we expect schools to employ anyone who fancied calling himself a teacher? Do we have as Ministers just anyone who fancies calling himself a Minister? Why will the Government not recognise that the people who run careers services are professionals who have learnt a trade? They have devoted themselves to a vocation and a profession. Where do the proposals address the question of impartial advice? I should welcome the Minister's comments on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is not agreed to, I fear that the Bill will have a severely detrimental effect on careers services and on the people who use them: young people, their parents and employers. Fragmentation will result. The coherence of the careers services will be broken up by private contractors bidding for parts of the whole and, perhaps, dealing only with the fashionable and profitable parts—not with those parts that meet real needs and provide real services for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasing commercialisation will result and those clients who face the greatest difficulties in the labour market may not be attractive to commercial employers. The amendment would help to reduce that effect. Commercialisation could result in a loss of continuity. That is why we want a quality threshold to be introduced. Where there is no involvement of relevant interests, a careers service might serve the needs of only one interest group—employers, for example—rather than all interest groups which forms a triumvirate of employers, parents and young people. Commercialisation and the lack of a quality threshold will make the situation worse. The education service will lose trust in careers advice and the loss of public accountability—whatever Government Members think—is important considering the level of expenditure of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the clause is the part that defines the type of person who may provide careers services. Unless the Minister says otherwise, we understand that the provisions in the clause would allow any Joe Bloggs, Harriet, Tom or Dick to operate careers services. I could walk out of this Room tomorrow and decide to set myself up as, "David Hanson, Member of Parliament. Careers services at your service." In between doing my surgeries I could do an hour providing careers advice. We do enough of everything else, so let us do a bit of that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that I have no qualifications and have never looked at a careers manual in my life would make no difference to my ability to present myself as a fully qualified and fully operational careers officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be unqualified. A careers officer could even be someone who was not local.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a person heading a careers office in, for example, the constitutency of the

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What prevents the local authority from not employing an unqualified person is that it has local accountability and professional standards.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if we could discuss that later. It would shorten the debate if we received early assurances from the Minister. If he accepted our amendments on a quality threshold, we should happily retire to another place and let the Minister begin the hard work of drafting the amendments to be introduced on Report. I suspect that he will not accept our amendments and that he will simply waft about a few pieces of paper in an attempt to cover up the lack of a quality threshold. Therefore, I shall carry on making my case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should certainly lose financial control, local accountability and qualified staff. I shall briefly share with the Committee the experiences in my region, the Principality of Wales. I am the only member of the Committee who represents a Welsh constituency. The way in which the careers service operates in Wales is indicative of what is at risk if the amendments are not accepted by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
Wales has eight careers services. After much effort over the past five or six years, they have gained corporate strength through cooperation and mutual support. As a group, the careers officers, working together—this is the important point that I want to impress on the Minister—have developed strong links with the Minister of State, Welsh Office, have provided a centralised voice on the careers service in terms of policy and practice, have worked with many major employers in Wales, such as BP Chemicals, and have published information that the Welsh Office has found most helpful, including the 1993 document on school-leaver destinations that I launched on Friday in my constituency. That document draws together information from each of the eight careers services in Wales and provides strong support to the Welsh Office by helping it to understand how the careers services work, how they are used at present by pupils and young people and what future level of service will be required. That was achieved by those eight careers services coming together as a corporate body. Does the minister believe that the benefits that stemmed from that collaborative partnership would have been achieved in the competitive atmosphere that the clause aims to introduce? The amendments will ameliorate the provisions of the clause and will ensure that competitiveness is not a feature of the way in which we plan for the future needs and aspirations of our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The careers services in Wales are represented on the partnership boards of the Bank of Wales plc, the CBI, BP Chemicals, Powys health authority and Walker Construction, to name but a few. All the services provided are of sufficient size and scope to be viable and to offer a full range of information, guidance and placement services to the urban and rural populations of Wales. The services aim in particular to give to young people, especially those with special education and training needs, support and information so that they can contribute on an equal footing with able-bodied, well-motivated individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without being partisan, I remind members of the Committee that, on 9 April 1992, Wales elected 27 Labour Members of Parliament and only six Conservative Members of Parliament out of a total of 38. It is important to take serious account of the mandate in my part of the world. Private contractors may be more selective about bidding for services and about the client groups, to which they offer these services. The amendments would help to strengthen the careers services, in line with the Minister's concerns, and would ensure that, in Wales, the good things that those services have built up—the resulting partnerships and the contacts that have been made in the public and private sector—are strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister reassure the local authorities in Wales? They fear that any new contractor who enters the market after the Bill is passed will need time and expertise to build up the regional dimension to the work of the careers services. The Welsh Office recognises the value of the work being done by the eight careers services in Wales. If the amendments are rejected and a whole new series of providers of careers services is introduced in Wales, what will happen to the expertise and contacts that have been built up? What will happen to the people with the valuable experience that enables a decent service to be provided to my constituents and others?

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0737">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
I feel that the amendments tabled by the Minister would damage the career services in my part of the world and elsewhere. I urge the Minister to give me positive answers to the questions that I have asked. The Minister's performance in the Committee to date assures me that I shall get a ready response. I look forward to him at least considering our basic points: that there should be accountability, a level of quality thresholds to ensure that a quality service is provided and an assurance that the people on the receiving end of the service are served to the best of our ability. If the Government have the interests of future generations of employers and employees at heart, I hope that the Minister will seriously consider our amendments and support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak against the clause and in favour of the amendments. Were the Government to listen to advice from careers officers and various bodies, they would realise that clause 33 is unnecessary. I do not know whether the Department of Employment is trying to gather responsibilities or whether it thinks that there will be a pressing need for more room in the Department of Education, but it is amazing that one Department wants to interfere in a service that operates well when, unfortunately, other Departments—particularly the Department of Trade and Industry—appear a little reticent to assist manufacturing industry, as we heard in the House earlier this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are turning the clock back many years by interfering in the excellent careers service that is provided throughout the British Isles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The careers service was built up not in five minutes but over many years and embodies much experience and expertise. I shall not admit to how many years have passed since I was at secondary school but, needless to say, the careers advice that youngsters received on leaving school then was extremely patchy—there were the local factories for girls and boys, the local mines for boys, and retailing. That was it. Young people knew where the jobs were and sought them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A terrible amount of frustrated ambition came to light years after they left school, because they had no careers guidance and, finished up in dead-end jobs with no prospects. With hindsight, they would have appreciated a good careers advisory service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Careers services exist not just to place young people in jobs but to encourage ambition. Sadly, "ambition" is a word that does not spring quickly to the minds of young people in Britain today. That has much to do with the depressing unemployment rate among them. Given that in last week's debates, the Government were hell-bent on abolishing wages councils, the young people of this country are being thrust into a low-wage, low-pay and low-skill economy. Perhaps that is why the Government are not concerned with the long-term future viability of the careers services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That upsets me, because it is important for the rights of all young people that they receive careers service advice. That should not start at the age of 14 or 15, only six months before the child leaves full-time secondary education, but when the child is 12 or 13. It is important also that advice be linked to employment and to the education service. The severing of the careers service from local education authorities, as provided for in the clause, is a bad and retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
I do not know whether any Conservative or Opposition Member knows the full meaning of subsidiarity. It seems to go around in circles. All I know is that the local careers advice provided by local education authorities is close to the people and to their communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage no benefit in having a central body in Whitehall to oversee the service. I can illustrate that with an example from my local authority in Warwickshire. As far as I am aware, its careers advisory service is excellent and gives young people much worthwhile guidance. Warwickshire's education budget is strapped for cash because although it is a Tory-controlled authority, it has been rate-capped two years running and its standard spending assessment for education is not as high as the county would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents in my constituency, which is in the north of Warwickshire, can only get a child psychologist to visit the area twice a week, because they live far from Warwick—the county is so strapped for cash that it cannot afford the petrol for five visits a week. That illustrates the difficulty in determining and delivering services when they are not based in an area that is readily accessible to those who require them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government have read, as have Opposition Members, representations by the careers advisory service and will seriously consider withdrawing clause 33—or, at the very least, accepting the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly in support of my hon. Friend's comments, and I put on record my strong opposition to the Government's proposed actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 244 would allow the responsibility for services to be left with local authorities. We disapprove of the Government's scheme to make careers services a function of central government. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey asked if that were part of a pattern—I think that it is, in terms of the Government's overall approach to education. My hon. Friend mentioned other debates in the House and discussions in Government about reducing the role of local authorities in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the further education college in my area was removed from local control against the wishes of everyone who was previously involved in running it. The attack on the careers service is considered part of that pattern, whereby the Government feel that they must do everything that local authorities were previously empowered to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Centralisation, to which my hon. Friends referred, is also part of that pattern. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden knows well the situation in Scotland, and my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn referred to that in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 45 million luckless inhabitants of the centralised country of England will all be dealt with by the Secretary of State in London, no matter how far from London they live. The careers service is meant to cover a population of 45 million, but will be dealt with from London by one Secretary of State—who comes from the same part of the country as practically the entire Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
We worry about the lack of links between the Cabinet, the Secretary of State and the regions of England, which would be covered willy-nilly by the proposal. That would be unfortunate and I should like my strong objections to such a centralised system to be put on record. I do not know how much independence the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales would have, should their views clash with those of the Secretary of State for Employment. I doubt whether there would be much latitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn referred to the disparity between the political majority in Scotland and Wales and the political majority in the United Kingdom. My constituency is in the north of England which, I think, has 29 Labour Members of Parliament out of 36. That is a larger majority than in any other part of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, instead of local authorities having responsibility for careers services, big sister rather than big brother will watch over them from London. Their freedom to manoeuvre and to adapt to local needs will be severely limited. We strongly disapprove of that limitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) mentioned subsidiarity. The more that one hears the Government talk about subsidiarity, the more it seems that, at European level, anything that the Government do not like is a matter of subsidiarity and, therefore, ought to be decided in Whitehall. However, a reverse subsidiarity operates within the United Kingdom. Anything that the Government do not want the local authorities to have responsibility for is taken away from them and concentrated in the hands of central Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Double standards, absolutely. The Government should not argue the case for subsidiarity just when it is convenient for them to do so. They must develop a consistent philosophy about that concept. So far, the Government have proved incapable of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I close by repeating some of the questions asked by my hon. Friends. Why do the Government feel that it is appropriate to introduce these changes at this time? We want hard information about this aspect, not blandishments from the Minister, who hopes that he will be able to say a few words and sit down and that no one will complain. Can he give us details about how the decision was made? Regarding consultation, how much contact has the Minister had with local authorities about the proposals? How many local authorities has the Minister had contacts with in Wales, Scotland and the various regions of England? How much pressure has been put on the Minister by the local authorities to introduce these changes? Can he provide proper assurances about quality? We are extremely concerned about that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the important point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, does the Minister accept that careers services should not simply serve as a recruitment agency for local employers but should give advice that is suitable for the short-term and long-term future of an individual? Are the Opposition's suspicions, that the proposals form part of a pattern, correct? It is unacceptable for the Government to go down that road. Unless the Minister can provide strong evidence that people up and down the land—in England,
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
Scotland and Wales—are calling out for these changes, we shall have no alternative but to vote against the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spent nearly 10 years with Strathclyde regional council, which is one of Great Britain's finest local authorities and is second to none. However the Government in their wisdom, want to abolish it. That is typical of this Government: they want to fix things which have nothing the matter with them and nothing broken. The proposals are another classic example of their attitude. The Government want to fix the careers service, when there is nothing wrong with it, and replace it with a centralised system. I thought that the Government had learnt their lesson from what has happened to the centralised system in soviet Russia which, at the end of the day, had to be dismantled. The Government, typically, do not seem to realise that the way forward is to leave the careers service in the hands of the local authorities. As I mentioned earlier, in my time as a Member of Parliament I have not received one complaint about the careers services. The opposite is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Minister an example. When I was involved with centrally controlled training schemes in Scotland, some of them were in an absolute mess and very corrupt. In my area, we had a problem which could be compared to the potential problem we shall face if the careers services are centralised. Officials of the former Manpower Services Commission helped their friends to get training schemes. The schemes were not properly equipped. There was no proper training and young people worked in dangerous conditions. Inappropriate people, such as bankrupts, ran those schemes. They did not get away with it—Tommy Graham made sure of that. At the end of the day the culprits got caught, but central Government officers and particular individuals had colluded. That is the danger that will face the careers services. The centre will not know what is happening to its toes. Clearly, the government are not concerned about young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is so open to abuse that the Government must reconsider. A factory, which traditionally employs people to work in bad conditions, might want to employ young people. That employer would use people whom he could guide easily into his system by giving them a wee bump. We know that that happens. I am fearful of removing the link between schools and the careers services. My sons were invited to the careers department to find out how to set about getting jobs. They received guidance and were told where their education could best be used in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with hundreds of young people who have been to the careers services and who have landed luckily and decently in jobs to which they were suited. I fear that a fast buck will be made by the delivery of young people in my constituency into dead-end jobs. A wee bit of money would ensure that kids did not end up in dead-end jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should learn, chapter and verse, how some of the training schemes went wrong and how funds were directed towards schemes in which it was disgraceful to train young people. I could tell the Minister about many schemes which, at the end of the day were denied finance, by then they had been running for some time. Many of the schemes were abandoned completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that, once again, there will be abuse. It is essential that not just the young person who is looking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
for a job but his parents can trust in the careers services to guide their child into work. Years and years ago, ordinary men and women understood that local authorities were on their side. The careers services in my area did a magnificent job under difficult circumstances. Parents built up tremendous trust in the service because they saw that their children were getting appropriate and decent guidance from real professionals—not fast-buck merchants, not someone who decided to do some careers guidance to make a few bob.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always experienced problems when the Government changed training schemes. Nearly every fast-buck merchant in Scotland was dying to make money from employment training. We saw them driving about in their Rolls-Royces or Cadillacs and living in their big, fancy houses, but the young people who were supposed to get training did not get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government know exactly what I am talking about. Do they genuinely want no one, especially young people, to have any faith in the careers services? I am convinced that this is a shyster's charter. It will not ensure that kids get the best advice or the best planning for their futures—advice will be provided not by a professional but by a fast-buck merchant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister listens to me, he will not go down a damaging road but will leave the career service as it is. Why fix something that works? Leave the service well alone or, if the Minister wants to improve it, give it more money so that kids can get jobs. Do not go down the road of low pay, the abolition of wages councils, and centralisation but ensure that young people have a decent opportunity in society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden began the debate by explaining our belief that the proposal aims to privatise the careers service. Our worries relate not just to issues of principle, although those play a part, but of practicality. We have learnt to our cost what happens when services are hived off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is salutary to consider what happened when the Government decided to hive off 51 Skills Training Agency centres. In a costly experiment, £2 million was provided to run four centres, which went into liquidation. Another ceased trading last autumn. ASTRA, which operated 45 centres, ran into trouble and had to close eight of them and lay off 1,200 staff. Those examples clearly demonstrate the dangers that the proposal pose to the careers service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's proposal is accepted, we shall be left with a mishmash of provision that may be effective in some areas, but probably not in others. Accountability will be denied and the provision will be subject to much central control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members gave examples from their areas. I shall talk briefly about Birmingham and describe the type of service that will be under threat if the proposal is accepted. In Birmingham, in one year, 38,000 young people and 10,000 adults are interviewed by the careers service. The relationship between the proposal and careers service involvement with adults is vague. In Birmingham, the service covers 111 secondary schools and 12 colleges, involves 140 training providers and more
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
than 1,000 teachers, and provides more than 150,000 items of information. That is the scale of its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Birmingham, as in other parts of the country, the service has pioneered the partnership principle and involved the city council and the TEC. Such joint operations, rooted in the local authority, work successfully. If such an operation is hived off, how can there be any confidence that that scale of activity and quality can survive and thrive? Nothing in the proposal gives me any confidence that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The careers service in Birmingham, in common with those in other parts of the country, has rejected the outdated notion that it should play only a gatekeeper role and is geared much more to a universal application. It aims at helping adults and young people with special needs, to ensure that they receive integrated and balanced vocational and academic advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is light years from the tunnel vision that is likely to result if the proposals are accepted, whereby bodies with a vested interest will channel young people into particular jobs, slots, or training schemes. A vast amount of time, human and local authority resources were necessary to build the trust and partnership with employers and the schools that an effective careers service needs. How long will it take to rebuild that trust and to re-establish that relationship?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if it were possible to do that in the one, two or three years for which the contract will run, what would be the point when careers services already exist and already provide a successful, valued and useful service in not just Birmingham but Wales, Scotland, the north-east, and every other part of the country mentioned today?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that Conservative Members may hold different views and say, "At least if the proposals go through as they stand"—particularly with one or two Opposition amendments—"there may even be the chance that services will improve." I do not see much evidence for that belief, but let us assume that improvements might be made. What test will be applied to ascertain that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if there is a test, how will local people—for whom the service is meant to exist in the first place—have a say in its control? As worded, the proposals give no firm basis for local authority accountability. If the amendments are accepted, at least some local accountability will be injected. The partnerships exist already and much time and effort have been invested in them. They could provide a basis for local accountability, but only if they are rooted in the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to allow careers services to enjoy the democratic accountability, professional input and expertise that careers officers have built up over several years, in the frame work of the local authority. There is also the issue of national standards. Later, we shall examine proposals to introduce national standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask Conservative Members to consider in detail the Government's proposals, which provide no guarantees or assurances. The amendments will introduce some assurances and the basis for the local accountability and quality of work that has been built up over several years to be maintained—not frittered away in an experiment that is almost certainly bound to succeed. [Hon. Members: "Bound to succeed?"]. I am sorry; I meant, bound to fail. It is getting late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister prefers my original remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen enough cuts made to services for young people in the past year. A report published this week revealed massive cuts in the youth service budget. Last year, £5 million was cut from the budgets of the 55 authorities included in that survey. We should not compound the major problems confronting youth services by embarking on an experiment that has no guarantee of success and which will destroy much of what has been developed. I hope that Conservative Members will exercise a little independent judgment, will notice the gaps in the proposals, and accept our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to say that we have had an interesting debate, because the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will complain. Never has so much rubbish been talked by so few hon. Members as in the debate. I cannot say that I have been convinced for one second by any of the Opposition Members' comments this afternoon. We have heard the usual bogus story that the proposal is a way to undermine local education authorities and to encourage schools to become grant maintained. That is total nonsense. A school can become grant maintained only if that is what the parents in the area want. These changes are a long way away from those that were forced upon the educational establishment by the Labour Government, who forced comprehensive education on the nation without giving parents the opportunity to express their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the belief of the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) that the proposal will reduce and undermine the role of the local education authorities. The Labour party's defeatism is interesting. Opposition Members automatically assume that every local authority provides a service which is so inferior that it is bound not to be successful in continuing to provide the service that we require when it faces competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have the opportunity to tell my hon. Friend the Minister about a meeting that I had with the careers service in my area—Essex—on Friday. It welcomes the opportunity to break away from the local authority and to have responsibility for the services that it provides through the Minister. That careers service welcomes competition and believes that it will win the contract because it provides an excellent service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Several organisations are looking forward to the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate, it has been suggested too often that we shall impose a national careers service from London or Whitehall. That is not what we propose, nor what the enabling legislation will bring about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a little progress before I give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One should also realise the importance that the Department of Employment attaches to the careers service. The Secretary of State is already responsible for
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
funds to strengthen the careers service, for the inspection of the careers service and for advice and guidance on the operation of the service. The Department plays a huge role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked where we first discussed the proposal. It was trailed in the White Paper "Education and Training for the 21 st Century" which explains our commitment to the reforms. The foreword was written by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that there would still be a local service. If I, either as a Member of Parliament or as a parent, wanted to complain about the careers service provided in my local area under the new arrangements, to whom would I complain? Who will be ultimately accountable? Who is accountable now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned an area in which dramatic changes are taking place. I do not know what the full results of the restructuring of local government will be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish. I am trying to answer the hon. Gentleman, if he will give me a few seconds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what the full outcome of the restructuring of local government will be or, indeed, what the full outcome of more and more schools becoming grant maintained will be. Anyone who wishes to complain about the service will have the same recourse to their Member of Parliament, who will be able directly to ask questions of the Secretary of State. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] There is great hilarity on the Opposition Benches. I do not see why there should be. The fact is that there will be parliamentary questions and other usual channels which hon. Members will have at their disposal. I am sorry that Opposition Members believe that their role in this place is so ineffectual. No doubt they will not go to their constituents in due course and say that it is a waste of time voting for them because they are ineffectual when they are in the House. If that is what they are saying, I am slightly surprised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why he attempted to mislead the Committee just a few minutes ago by saying that there would be a local, accountable service?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The service will naturally be accountable to the people that it serves. It will be the kind of service that one would anticipate and expect from it. As I have said to the Committee, we regard the careers service as vital. That is why, after 20 years, we have decided that a change is required and that a duty should be placed upon the Secretary of State for Employment. We are enhancing the role of the careers service and careers guidance by putting that requirement on my right

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister serious when he says that the Government are enhancing the service by centralising it? Is he serious when he says that if someone were to complain about the careeers service, that person would go to his or her Member of Parliament? Does the Minister think that fine-tuning the current arrangements, will lead to less centralisation? If so, you have not learnt the lesson of Soviet Russia.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that there will be locally contracted service and that direct responsibility will be placed upon the Secretary of State ensures a new area of accountability as far as the Secretary of State is concerned. It will give Members of Parliament the opportunity to call the Secretary of State to account. The way in which that service is provided means that it will be accountable. I think that that will be a change and a development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that it has been an interesting debate. He may believe that, but I do not think that I can share his enthusiasm at this particular point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fundamental change which reflects the importance this Government attaches to careers guidance—both in helping individuals to achieve their potential and in securing an efficient labour market. We are aiming to move away from the constraints of a single, national model. The new legislation will allow a broader range of options to encourage innovation, higher standards and greater efficiency. We want to see greater flexibility and responsiveness to local communities throughout Great Britain and to bring together the commitment and skills, particularly among employers, to ensure young people get the first-class service they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new arrangements will be underpinned by comprehensive quality assurance arrangements, including the setting of standards and performance indicators which build on and develop the best of current practice. The legislation is not intended to alter the fundamental principle of statutorily based careers advice, guidance and placing services provided free to the core client group on an impartial basis. The young people of our country need and deserve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about the need to ensure that high standards are set and monitored. The Government endorse that view and are taking the issue of quality very seriously. We made that commitment clear from the outset when we launched the White Paper "Education and Training for the 21st Century".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to maintain the achievements of the careers service, what guarantees are there that
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
assessment and other services for adults will be maintained? As far as I can see, the Bill gives no such guarantees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The guarantee is for the core group. There is no requirement to expand beyond that. I hope that, as a result of more attention being paid to the service, careers advice will be expanded. That is one of the most exciting developments that the legislation will help to facilitate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) mentioned various local authority cuts, but it is for local authorities to determine their priorities within the overall budget constraints put on them by—[hon. Members: "By the Government"]—Absolutely. That has always been the case. It was the same in 1976, when we witnessed the most vicious public expenditure cuts ever implemented by a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer—so we take no lessons from the Opposition. I believe that it was an Opposition Member who said that the party was over for local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restrictions on local authority spending are nothing new. They have been consistently imposed on local authorities for several years. That is my answer to the hon. Member for Northfield. I see this as a way of expanding the service, which may become more available to adults in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland has priority treatment areas where local authorities target projects. The careers office does a positive job in trying to encourage people in areas of multiple deprivation to earn a living and in assisting them to find jobs. Has the Minister considered areas of priority treatment in the careers service, and that local authorities should make their budgets fit the situation? I certainly cannot imagine any private organisation wanting to take on the problems of deprived areas. Has the Minister given that aspect much thought?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall give thought to the way in which services are contracted locally. That will be important when we make decisions in the light of the legislation. At present, there is standard guidance but wide variations in performance. I referred to the standard guidance that was issued by my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir Norman Fowler) when he was Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clients are not sure what to expect. We want to put that right. There is no doubt in our minds that the careers service can raise its overall quality. The high standard of service achieved by the best should be available everywhere—and we are seeking to achieve precisely that within the framework of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will revise the guidance on the operation of service that she currently provides. It will enshrine the key principles of good guidance—impartiality, comprehensive coverage of all career options, and equality of opportunity—and ensure that they are observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In future, organisations aspiring to provide services will have to compete. They must demonstrate that they can meet demanding quality standards and sustain them, because if they do not they will lose their contracts. The standards will require services to listen to what their customers say. Real quality—worthwhile quality—is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
meeting realistically the customer's specification, not giving the customer what you think they want. Those are the standards that matter. Those are the standards that we want the new careers service to fulfil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will have all the powers that she needs to ensure that the arrangements that she makes work. The present role of the careers service inspectorate—which includes inspecting services regularly, producing public inspection reports, and providing a consultancy service—will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will continue to have the power to obtain whatever information from careers services that she, or her counterparts in Scotland and Wales, specify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to convince the Committee that the proposals have been clearly thought out. If they have been, will he explain how, at the point of contracting, he or the Secretary of State anticipate quantifying the capital assets of the careers service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On implementation, it will be our aim to ensure that the existing and potential providers have an equal chance to provide the service. The process will be managed so as to reduce the turmoil and to ensure the continuity of service for the clients. The most appropriate way to achieve that will be through a tightly managed and phased introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system has been in place for nearly 20 years. It has done well in the circumstances in which it has been required to operate. We know of very good work being done by the service to help many young people, but the service is constrained by a bureaucracy that governs local authority structures and systems. Times have changed. Education and training systems have been reformed. For the future, we need a system of providing efficient and effective careers advice and guidance that can adapt more quickly to the needs of employers and young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not saying that the service as a whole had been under-performing or that the present framework is entirely wrong. But we are saying that we can have a better, more efficient and effective service by providing the invigorating stimulation of competition, exposing service providers to private sector disciplines, increasing the sensitivity to customer needs and giving the careers service commercial freedoms and flexibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that even the Opposition would try to pretend that, somehow, the Government would bring about these changes to ensure that we provide a system that is not as good as the system that we presently provide. That would be a waste of time and it is not something that we want. We are concerned to ensure that there will be a greater and more flexible service provided to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East, before I missed one of her many consistent questions during the Committee, asked me about the consultations that I have had. I have twice met the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Association of County Councils when we discussed the proposals that have caused concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us a few more details about their attitude to the proposals? What reaction did
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
he receive to them? As he said, they were trailed in the White Paper. Can he give us any idea of the percentages of local authorities that favour the proposals and those that do not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give those particular figures. The hon. Lady's question was about the consulation and meetings that I had. There were two meetings with the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, which, it is true to say, did not overwhelmingly endorse our proposals. That is hardly surprising. I have yet to see the AMA congratulate the Government on any of their proposals. That would require a great change in character of the AMA. The Association of County Councils also registered concerns but understood some of the reasons for what we are trying to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I elicit an answer from the Minister? If contracting takes place, how do the Government intend to quantify the capital assets of the careers service and how will it separate them from those of local authorities? Presumably, if the Government have thought the matter through, as they claim to have done, they will know the answer. However, I have yet to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we get Parliament's authority to implement the proposals, we will consider carefully how they can best be achieved in certain areas. We will provide sufficient funds to operate services to meet the Secretary of State's duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have again, in the immortal words of the Minister, had an "interesting debate". I realise that he did not say that just as he did not say much in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting aspect of the Minister's reply was how weak it was in justifying the clause and the proposals. I should have thought that his civil servants could do a bit better than that. The hon. Gentleman fell into the trap that I predicted when, in trying to justify the measure, he used phrases such as "flexibility and responsiveness" and "adapt more quickly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every time I hear those phrases I know that we are heading for a disaster and that there is no justification for what the Government are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also used the common phrases, "times have changed" and "its been around for 20 years"—ergo there must be change. On Second Reading, I pointed out that, although the House of Lords has been around for a very long time. The Government have not yet introduced an "Abolition of the House of Lords Bill" based on the same criteria. When trying to justify the measure, they should find some other excuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When all else fails, the Government then say, "No problem. This is just enabling legislation. Don't worry about it. We shall never use it, and if we do, the effects will be slight." In that case, why on earth are such measures introduced in the first place? We are still waiting for the Minister to answer that. The Minister also asked us to trust the Government because they would never do anything to make matters worse. I remember hearing that before they introduced the poll tax, and look what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
There is no doubt that what we have here is a centralised system of authority. The Minister could not make the distinction that we are trying to make. Two issues are involved: the provision of the service, and the authority under which the service is provided and monitored and the performance targets set. We are worried that the authority will be drawn centrally—which will impair oversight, performance and the setting of performance standards—and that there will be local provision. That is a recipe for an utter shambles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because we want to avoid such a shambles that we are opposed to the Bill. We realise the political reality, however, and so have tabled amendments that would provide for some statutory methods for an overseeing body that would allow local authorities or persons to set, achieve and monitor standards. The Minister has not responded to the question of method. He has said only that performance standards must be achieved. Will he tell the Committee who will set and enforce the standards. I ask him not to say merely that everything will be great and good and end up being for the best of all possible worlds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not accept my response. My hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could perceive a thread running through the previous set of amendments, but as I am finding this set more difficult, I hope that I shall be excused if I deal with the amendments in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The careers service is available currently to those who have left within two years relevant education. Amendment No. 191 would ensure that that continues in statutory provision. That is relevant when we consider that on the Secretary of State's admission, 19,000 individuals who left school did not receive the training places that should have been provided for them. Careers guidance should be provided for them, as proposed in amendment No. 191.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 192 is a technical amendment. It would make it clear that those who receive careers guidance are already in education. Guidance would, therefore, be for additional education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 193 would divide subsection (2) and emphasise the client-oriented basis of the careers service. The first part of the amendment deals with the client, and the second with the general service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 195 was tabled to attempt to ensure that people who will provide education under the Bill will offer educational and vocational guidance. It would prevent guidance being offered by those with expertise in only social or welfare guidance, which is not the responsibility of the careers service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 197 seeks clarification of the term "relevant education", to ensure that those who are entitled to careers guidance, especially young people with special educational needs, will continue to receive such guidance. "Relevant education" in the clause refers to higher education. A definition is provided in section 56(2) of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992 and the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. It defines universities as designated institutions. An individual who studies for a higher national certificate at a further education college will receive careers advice. However, an individual who takes the same course at an institute of higher education will not. A person who takes an access course as the first part of a degree course, which is franchised by a higher education institute, will receive help, while a person who takes an access course within the institute of higher education will not receive such help. The amendment seeks clarification from the Government. Who will still be eligible for careers guidance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 239 and 249 are complementary. They would provide that people should receive written statements of how the careers service envisaged their future and what services would be available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with each amendment in turn as I cannot see a common thread that runs through them. They cover important points but are not especially idealogically contentious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 249 would ensure that all pupils or clients who receive individual careers guidance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0744">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
also receive a written and agreed summary, perhaps for discussion with their parents or teachers, and as a stimulus to the development of their own plans or to further action or self-help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three reasons why I place emphasis on the written account. First, it may be difficult to accept, but research has revealed that 80 per cent. of what is heard is forgotten. Those of us who sit for many hours listening to interesting debates have an acquaintance with that statistic. So there is a need for written summaries that are agreed with the individuals concerned. They can refresh their memories, arrive at a mutually acceptable account of what occurred during particular interviews and confirm the plans that were agreed between the advisers and the clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if parents can be involved in helping their children to plan their career moves and the way in which they intend to pursue their interests through life, that parental support will help those children. Parents do not sit in on careers advice sessions, so if there is a written summary of what went on and the plans that were agreed, that will help to get them involved when the clients go home and discuss how they see the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final reason for the written summaries suggested in amendment No. 249 is that they would provide a useful way to ensure that impartial help had been given and they would monitor the work of the service. That is important if the Government plan to go down the road of competitive tendering because documents would exist which an independent monitoring group could use to check whether correct, professional and impartial advice was given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that I am as far from the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden on this group of amendments as I may have been on the previous group. I hope that I can reassure him that some of his points will be met and explain why the amendments are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be revising the guidance on the operation of services she currently provides. That will cover many of the characteristics of, and arrangements for providing services that the opposition have sought, through amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendment No. 191, I recognise that the opposition seek to introduce a higher degree of precision in the definition of those entitled to receive services and also acknowledge that there is an argument for such precision. However, I think that the arguments against outweigh those for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if we were to have a precise cut-off date after which the Secretary of State would not have a duty to secure services, it would be detrimental to those, for example, with special needs for whom two years might be too short a period. Such a restriction is not there in the current legislation which places the duty on LEAs. Our purpose is to open up different management routes, not to change the fundamental description or nature of the service provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if an arbitrary two-year limitation was to be imposed, a significant number of young people who currently receive services would be excluded in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
Rather than making the entitlement time-bound, I would prefer to leave some discretion so that the Secretary of State in the guidance to providers of careers services to be issued under the Act ensures that essentially all who currently receive services continue to do so. That is the place for such clarification, not in the clause as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to amendment No. 192, if young persons are following a programme of education at a school or college and they seek advice, it will often happen that they will need to go on another course of learning after their current programme. In a sense, that next course of learning would be additional for them. But it may not be a course that specifically adds to their current course as a continuation towards their goal. There is a danger that if in statute we designate the education that they can receive advice about as "additional", it will limit careers services to give advice about courses that in some way always move people along a particular route. Mostly this will be the case, but it is not necessarily always so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve their goal, on leaving education, young people may require an entirely different course which does not build on or add to their current course, or they may have changed their mind about their goal. Their new goal may require education that in no way adds to their previous course. I am sure that this is not what hon. Members intended and I am sure that they do not want to take this risk. Even if they are not totally convinced by the arguments, I am sure that they will acknowledge that there is a doubt and, therefore, will want to withdraw their amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 193 to 196 neither clarify the Bill nor seek to enhance the provision of service. Indeed, they would have the very opposite effect. They would place in doubt the inclusion in relevant services of the function of gathering information on those offering employment. That would be most unfortunate, because it would deprive young people of being given details of job vacancies, as part of a placing service that the Bill intends to continue as an integral part of careers service provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also undermine the obtaining of labour market information, including information on the destination of young people. A traditional strength of the careers service is its access to labour market information, which can be used to the benefit of the wider community and other key players, with whom collaboration will be promoted by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 195 is neutral as it is already covered by the wording of new section 8(1), which is about assisting people in their decisions relating to employment, training and education—in other words, assistance with decisions of an educational and vocational nature. I do not see the value of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 197 would promote wasteful duplication by ensuring that people in full-time and part-time education, including those in universities, would be entitled to receive services. Local education authorities do not provide services to any great extent to those in higher education or to those leaving universities. There is no duty to provide services to students in universities. If there ever is a need to provide services to those people, the Secretary of State will be able to use her powers under new section 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
Universities already have their own arrangements. The effect of the amendment would be to reduce the share of resources to those with an existing entitlement while providing additional resources for those where appropriate provision is already made. That cannot be cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exact nature of the service referred to in amendments Nos. 239 and 249 will be determined through both the guidance of a general character that the Secretary of State will be able to give under new section 10(6)(a) and through either arrangements made under new section 10(1) or directions given under new section 10(2) and 10(3). They will provide the methods of encouraging and supporting good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured the Committee about the value that we put on written summaries and guidance as good practice and that it agrees that the appropriate place for advice about such matters is in the Secretary of State's report "Guidance of a General Character." I also hope that I have met some of the concerns of the hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Wallasey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has met many of my concerns. As I said earlier, I do not think that, the amendments have much of an ideological basis and I do not think there are any sinister reasons behind the Minister not accepting them. He has given a clear exposition of why they are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I heard him correctly—that it is likely that amendment No. 191 will be included in the guidance. I understand the valid reason given as to why we should not have a two-year limit.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The general intention of the definitions of the client group under new section 8(3) will embrace essentially those people who are covered in the existing core client group. That does not include correspondence and distance learning at present. The core client group of young people in education, training and the jobs market is intended to remain essentially unchanged from that under the existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 8(3) is intended to cover full-time and part-time education that requires attendance at any education institution in Great Britain—other than the higher education sector or education undertaken for mainly recreational purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amending the definition to exclude correspondence courses and distance learning ensures that resources are targeted more effectively, with final eligibility decisions made in line with the guidance to be provided by the Secretary of State and according to the arrangements and directions made. Students following correspondence and distance learning courses need not be entirely excluded for all time under the provisions of clause 33. If the
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
Secretary of State wishes to do so, she could provide careers service to such students under the powers in new section 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend that the Committee accept the amendments, which clarify the definition of those for whom the Secretary of State will have a duty to secure services and, in doing so, to leave the duty as it is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the purpose of the amendment is to seek clarification. I am unhappy about the term "of a general character". It opens up a Pandora's box—not because of what it can be said to mean but because of what it can be said not to mean. It is all-embracing. It is not specific. That is the problem. If it is not specific, it will threaten the realistic basis of the current structure of the careers service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could have LECs, TECs, employment services, and companies bidding for a careers service provision. They could then subcontract the provision of guidance to young adults while retaining the placement function of a careers service. That problem was raised in the initial set of amendments. We should be back to the position in 1974. At one stage, we had careers guidance. Then one had to go to the jobcentre or the unemployment exchange in order to be placed for the job. These two functions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
have been brought together. The two amendments seek to ensure that they remain together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 246 seeks to establish entitlement to a complementary programme of careers education in schools and, secondly, to ensure that impartial careers guidance will be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the contracting out process begins, one finds that everything is packaged in separate boxes. We need to ensure that there is a complementary supply of careers education in schools to assist those who are giving careers guidance. Careers education tends to take place between year nine—or what I prefer to call the third year, prior to pupils making their choice of subjects—and year 11, the fifth year. Co-ordination is essential, because careers teachers in schools have other responsibilities, but it is important for them to be there to help pupils to decide on their future role and what subjects they want to do to help them get where they want to be. Careers teachers can organise industrial sponsorship for pupils with local businesses. They have a role in helping pupils to decide on subjects so that they do not make decisions that are wrong for what they want to do. It is important for continuity that that complementary service continues to be available in schools. Amendment No. 246 would ensure that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Impartiality was touched on when debating our earlier amendments. My hon. Friends observed that careers guidance must be seen to be given impartially, so that it is not considered to be a recruitment agency for local job vacancies but is client oriented and can deal with individuals' ambitions and how they can achieve them. It must be seen to be impartial in other respects. For example, if an individual is advised to go to a further education college there may be funding implications. We want an assurance from the Minister that those who will be giving such advice to pupils will have no vested interest in directing them to particular colleges of further education, a job down the road or anywhere else, so that their information and advices will be impartial and neutral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: New section 10(6) seeks to require providers of careers services to perform their functions in accordance with guidance of a general character given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. That is a continuation of the existing duty. The guidance is described as "of a general character" so that it will not be extended to issues of detail in the management of the service. Those will be matters for the ensuing contracts between the Department and future providers, or for directions to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 204 would remove the designation "of a general character". I ask the Committee to resist that change. Although the duty under the Bill will shift from the local education authority to the Secretary of State, we believe that there is good reason to maintain the provision of guidance of a general character, even though its purpose will be slightly different. In future, through the process of making arrangements—which in most cases will be through contracts—it will be possible to agree precisely the service to be provided. It will be possible—indeed, necessary—to be more precise than at present. Amendment No. 246, which seeks to specify in detail what the guidance should be, is also unneccesary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
Guidance of a general character will still be needed to set a national framework for standards, to give national coherence and to determine the broad nature of the services. That will act as a benchmark for local arrangements and ensure cohesion between the services provided. We do not want guidance that stifles innovation, prevents services from responding flexibly to local needs or imposes overly prescriptive requirements. We do not anticipate that guidance of a general character will change from year to year. We expect that, as has been the case up to now, it will stand for some time. Moreover, because we are talking about guidance of a general character, we will be able to consult the stakeholders in its preparation. We and they wish that to happen. It is desirable that guidance of a general character continues to exist. Such guidance will contribute to ensuring that coherent and cohesive arrangements for services are made, and I hope that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will withdraw his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey spoke about independence and proper guidance. That is an important point. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that the careers service already has regard for what is available in a locality. It does not push people down particular routes, but merely points out locally available opportunities and opportunities that are more widespread. I hope that my remarks have reassured the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was partially reassured until I heard the dreadful words "flexibility" and "innovation" yet again. The alarm bells started ringing, because I know that whenever I hear those words there will be problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was in part a probing amendment to provoke a discussion of general guidance. I accept the Under-Secretary's response on that question. However, what is there to prevent a LEC or TEC, or some other institution, contracting to undertake careers guidance and then subcontracting to another body the guidance and information being given to the young people or pupils, while providing only the actual employment service itself? That would be similar to the situation that existed 20 years ago, when young people went to one place for guidance and to another for employment. A schools guidance officer told young people what to do and they went down to the local employment exchange. Does the Under-Secretary intend that the contracts will be extremely tight to prevent that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, amendment No. 252 is also concerned with the statutory body to oversee quality in the careers service, a subject on which we touched earlier in our proceedings. How will standards be maintained? Who will set them? Who is answerable for them? Who will assess them? Who will assess the performance indicators? Those are some of the relevant questions which the amendments address. They propose that the Secretary of State sets up arrangements with his Ministers and other persons representing education authorities, parents, schools, and so on. The options are many and varied. However, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
Bill does not provide for any consultative body to advise the Secretary of State on the performance of his duty. Such a provision was included in the Employment and Training Act 1973. The Bill offers scope for numerous bodies to provide those services. To safeguard the interests of clients, it is essential that there should be a national body concerned with quality and standards. The Minister spoke about the setting and maintenance of standards. If that is to become a reality rather than a pious hope, the Government should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. The Opposition would prefer a more localised form of accountability, but if the Secretary of State is to assume centralised powers, as the Minister said, it is imperative that there should be a body to advise the Secretary of State on the best way of meeting the needs of pupils, young people, employers and those working in the careers service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Employment is, I am sure, eminently sensible and a fine person to work for, as Ministers will no doubt testify. I am sure that the civil servants who back her up are eminently worthwhile citizens. In future, however, careers services will be centralised and focused on the Secretary of State. Sensible, practical advice from the people who receive those services must find its way to the Secretary of State, not just the present Secretary of State, but future Secretaries of State who may be—perhaps my views are jaundiced—even less sympathetic to the needs of the careers service than those whose proposals we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have stressed the need to maintain quality assurance. If that cannot be done at local level, there should be a statutory body at national level to support the aspirations of those who use the service and of those who are responsible for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. We hope that the Minister will present further proposals at a later stage. An advisory body reporting to the Secretary of State should not include in its membership those who had won contracts to provide careers services. There should be service-user input to the Secretary of State at national level to reflect the concerns and wishes of those who operate and use the services locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, and urge the Minister to consider the amendment as a way of meeting aspirations and maintaining accountability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify further some of the issues underlying amendment No. 252. It says that there should be a national mechanism dedicated to securing quality careers guidance and a national council for careers guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If locally provided careers guidance services are to be contracted out, the system will become more fractured than it is now and we shall face an even more confusing patchwork of provision. Some places will have good provision while others might have bad provision. If the system is fragmented to that extent, quality might suffer, especially if a contracting system comes into use. When services are contracted out, it is always difficult to achieve quality assurance. It would be a good idea to establish a national mechanism that could contribute to quality assurance.

Such a mechanism would ensure a minimum provision throughout the country. In that way, if there were to be different provisions in different areas, none of them would fall below a certain quality. Under a fractured system, the chance to have a strategic overview would be lost. There will be much local provision and best practice would not be spread around nationally. I support the idea of a national organisation that could provide an umbrella presence. That would ensure a strategic approach to the matter, so that the Secretary of State could be informed of what was going on in the country. He could have a specific body that could supply him with information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is not new. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications is helping to set standards of vocational qualifications that are offered in different areas. The system must have coherence. It could also monitor what is happening nationally, ensure quality and be an authoritative independent voice that can advise the Secretary of State on the development and delivery of quality careers guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In tabling the amendment, Opposition Members have taken their lead from existing legislation. They might not appreciate that there is such a power, but it has not been used for almost 10 years. It was tried but it did not prove its worth, and the careers service does not seem to have lost anything as a result. It is sensible and desirable for the Secretary of State to consult about the operation of services for which she is responsible. The Secretary of State consults now and can in future, but times limited, targeted consultation has proved to be more effective than the service provided by the type of standing organisation under the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an official level, we have the careers service consultative group. It considers matters affecting the careers service, such as training, publicity and development funding, and provides broad guidance to the Secretary of State on the operation of the careers service. That has proved to be helpful and we expect similar arrangements to be made in future. The Secretary of State and her Ministers regularly meet representatives of the Institute of Careers Guidance, the National Association of Careers Guidance Teachers, and the National Heads of Service Group, which represents the heads of careers services and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other forums in which matters concerning careers guidance, training and employment of young people are considered. Similar opportunities will continue. Opposition Members have argued that an organisation such as that described in amendment No. 252 will help to ensure high standards and impartiality. We want the highest possible standards of service. We shall ensure that by making arrangements with the best providers in each area. We shall be setting demanding standards and we shall continue to monitor and inspect. Unlike now, those who do not reach the required standards will lose their right to run the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain how he envisages the development of strategies for careers guidance without the existence of a national organisation? It is important to have national strategies rather than a response to local provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us about the consultations that his Department had prior to publication of the Bill? We
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
accept that the Institute of Careers Guidance believes that the establishment of a national body is crucial to the future development of the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has raised a number of points. The White Paper was published some time ago and there were a number of responses to that. The Bill sets out our intentions. I cannot give the hon. Lady a specific date, but I spoke at the institute's conference in Lancaster. I outlined the general view and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave an extensive interview. I realise that the institute wishes to pursue this matter. I have tried to explain why I do not believe that it is necessary. A framework already exists that allows for consultation and representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has the Minister to say about strategic planning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Lady means by strategic planning. Planning is important and guidance will be given. We take the matter seriously and we will set standards which will put the consumer first. Quality will be achieved by meeting the customer's specifications; not giving them what the institute or the professionals think that they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are worried about impartiality, but the legislation guarantees that. The purpose of the service that the Secretary of State will procure is to help people with their career decisions having regard to their capabilities, what they are suited for and what is available. To achieve that the services provided will have to be impartial and the monitoring of the service will confirm whether that is so. The careers inspection service will continue. It regularly reports on careers services currently provided by local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I again heard the words "consumer first". I have another phrase to add to my lexicon of alarming phrases: "time-limited, targeted consultation". My definition of that is to speak for a short time to those who will tell us what we want to know. We should be very wary about such civil service speak. However, despite our unhappiness, we do not wish to push this to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 205, in page 48, line 47, leave out "transfer" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"co-operate in the provision of relevant information".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with an area of particular concern to Opposition Members. Subsection (7) gives the Secretary of State the power to give directions to local education authorities to transfer information from one place to another. The problem is that careers officers, as well as taking into account such matters as school performance, attitude and ability, also have information from the person's medical records and perhaps from his criminal record. It is wrong for a career's officer to be able to transfer information from someone's medical record to another body without that person's consent. Medical information is an individual part of that person and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0749">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
should be given to others only with consent. We must not breach confidentiality. The same applies to criminal records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow local authorities to provide relevant information but not necessarily to transfer all information, so that the privacy of a person's medical or criminal record would be maintained. In addition, both medical and criminal records could be transferred only with the individual's permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Opposition consider that access to the information contained in records is necessary. I have listened carefully to the debate. Quite rightly, the transfer of such confidential information may cause concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to confirm our intention that there should continue to be the proper respect for the confidentiality of such records. The transfer of records will be consistent with the conditions under which the records were constructed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that gives the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. However, if it does not, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to give greater clarification of the points that he has raised. I hope that that will reassure him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister wishes to reassure me and that he has sought to do so; all the same, he has not. Is he saying that the way in which the current regulations are structured means that it will be possible to transfer information only with the specific approval and permission of the individual? If the Minister can give me that assurance, I shall withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 253, in page 49, line 3, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7A) The Secretary of State shall provide directions to local education authorities, education authorities and persons with whom he has made arrangements for the provision of services specifying the arrangements and conditions for the transfer of staff involved in the delivery of such services and the eligibility of staff to participate in the Local Government Superannuation Scheme.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the genuine and well-understood fears of those involved in the careers service about the arrangement that will be made when staff are transferred. It covers the conditions of transfer for all staff who deliver the services and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the eligibility of staff to participate in the Local Government Superannuation Scheme."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee appreciate that there will be changes and great fears about what will happen. We seek clarification of what will be involved for those taking part directly in the transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand what lies behind the amendment. The Opposition want to sustain staff conditions, including their pension rights, in order to offer
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
staff some reassurance about the future. I also want to offer staff some reassurance about their future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider that the careers service staff do not need the kind of straitjacket protection that the Opposition seek on their behalf. The existing staff have the sort of skills and knowledge that will be required by the new providers of careers services. I expect, therefore, that most of the staff will experience a smooth transition to the new arrangements. It will be for them to decide freely on this and not to be dictated to by the Secretary of State on the conditions that they should accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say something on pensions. Employees of local authorities are covered by the local government superannuation scheme—LGSS—and the corresponding Scottish scheme. If they continue as local government employees, their pension rights will remain under LGSS. The most recent advice I have is that that would be the case if the local authority or the education authority continued to provide the careers service; or if the local education authority or education authority created a local authority-owned company to provide the service; or if the staff were seconded to another organisation to provide the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where these three options do not apply, the proposed new LGSS membership provisions will require providers of careers services to leave the scheme. If employees freeze their accrued pension rights in the LGSS, they will be fully protected against inflation. Alternatively, they can choose to transfer their accrued rights either to their new employer's scheme or to a personal arrangement under a private pension scheme. Any decision on membership of the LGSS must fall to be considered by my right Hon. Friends the Secretary of State for the Environment or the Secretary of State for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish to impose a straitjacket on the conditions of staff of the kind that is sought in the Opposition's amendment. We want them to be free to enter into the new arrangements as they wish, and confident in their own ability, which I believe they have to contribute to the new era in careers guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister calls a straitjacket is a guarantee of certain members' conditions and rights. It is precisely that sort of phrase that we were talking about. The Minister may say that he does not wish to impose a straitjacket, but what he means is that he is not too concerned about what happens to individuals' pensions and rights. That is a classic case of sophistry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would impose on the Secretary of State a duty to report to Parliament on the functions of the careers service. The clause gives the Secretary of State wide and extensive powers and it would be improper if they were granted without recourse to Parliament. The amendments provide for an annual inspection and for the Secretary of State to report back to Parliament so that hon. Members can question him or her.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would ensure that there are independent inspections of performance. The Minister gave us some assurances on the matter, which are important in the light of the Government's refusal to create a national council that would help to ensure good quality throughout the country. Sir Bryan Nicholson has recently come out in support of the proposed national council, although the Minister has put it on one side. That leaves an independent inspectorate with nowhere to send its inspections. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about ensuring that there are credible and impartial inspections of the new providers of the career services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Secretary of State for Employment presents to Parliament jointly with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury an annual report which sets out objectives and expenditure plans for the next three years. This already covers the Department's work with respect to the careers service and it will continue to do so. In addition to describing the work of the Department, the report gives an account of the Department's performance in meeting its objectives. Similar arrangements exist in Scotland and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The careers service is a valuable and important service but it is relatively small. It does not need the bureaucracy of a separate report. However, I shall carefully consider the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would allow education authorities to continue to provide services and to make arrangements with bodies that might also be contracted to do that work. There is a conflict for us in that it clearly facilitates a transfer of functions from one to another. Subsection (5) limits the provision to a period of two years. There is a time limit because there is a transitional period before the service is fully privatised. We questioned whether we should cooperate with the privatisation of the service. However, we would wish to ensure that the transitional arrangements are as smooth as possible for the clients. It is for that reason that we find some merit in new clause 13. Amendment No. 255, to which I think my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey wants to speak, is partly a consequence of new clause 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an interesting difference between new clause 13 and amendment No. 255. The amendment goes further than the new clause, by proposing that public body status should be granted to existing providers rather than that the ability to buy in administrative and technical support services should end within two years. The new clause does not go far enough. It proposes a temporary transitional arrangement. By granting public body status to existing providers, the amendment would allow the careers guidance services that are provided by local authorities to be used on a longer-term basis. That would provide careers services with more of a base from which to work and would be seen as more than just a transition from the public to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we welcome the provisions of new clause 13, they do not go far enough. New clause 13 seems to exclude those bodies that currently provide services from bidding for those services, once privatisation has taken place. It seems to suggest that local authorities would not be able to get involved in the tendering process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell me whether those are the differences between the amendment and the new clause? If clause 33 is approved as it is now worded, bodies that currently provide careers services should be allowed to bid for new contracts, especially where partnerships already exist, in the same way as the Tom, Dick or Harriet, to whom I referred in earlier debates, can bid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about Tom, Dick or Harriet. Tom, Dick or Angela may be more appropriate in the context of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the Opposition that local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales should be allowed to supply goods and services to those who run the careers services, but we do not accept that this should be restricted only to those providers who have charitable status under the Charities Act 1960. We think that this facility should be time limited. Under this legislation for the careers service a wide variety of providers could emerge. Those could include local education authorities, local authority-controlled companies, training and enterprise councils, local enterprise companies, joint ventures
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
between LEAs and TECs, and other types of private providers. In Scotland, those providers could include education authorities and LECs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want all providers—not just those with charitable status—to have this facility for up to two years. We consider that this will give sufficient time for the new careers service to become established. This is in line with the proposals for grant-maintained schools contained in the Education Bill and is clearly spelt out in new clause 13.

It is appropriate that, towards the end of the debate on the Bill, the Minister and I can come home to talk about training in Scottish Enterprise and in Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of amendments Nos. 234 and 235—I realise that only one has been moved, but they are connected—lies in my constituency. It is unusual that I can discuss an important issue of detail with the benefit of an example in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lennox Castle hospital, which is a hospital for the mentally handicapped, ran a fine training scheme for those in its care—the clients as they are now known, although I do not like that word. The scheme was funded
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
by the local enterprise company, Dunbartonshire Enterprise. Cuts led to the cutting of the training budget. I knew that that would catch the Minister's attention. I know how to press the right buttons for the Minister. The draconian cuts to the training budgets of local enterprise companies meant that that vital training scheme was dropped, on the basis that the local enterprise company had no duty—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Gentleman debating both amendments, together or taking them separately?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am taking them separately but the issues are related so I thought that, with a little leeway, I might fudge them together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local enterpise company had no duty to fund the training scheme, which was stopped. The hospital was told to apply to Employment Action but was not given any money from that body; it is available only to those who are available for work. Because of their handicaps, the people at the hospital were not considered to be available for work. Therefore, the scheme collapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem lay not with the enterprise company, or with the Department of Employment, or with Employment Action. The problem lay with the health board. Had there been a statutory right for the local enterprise company to provide training for and services to develop the social skills and self-esteem of people with disabilities, the problem would not have arisen. That is the basis upon which the amendments are linked. The aim is to ensure that when local enterprise councils faced draconian Government cuts, they will have a statutory obligation to consider and develop the needs of those with disabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to be back in the Committee discussing Scottish matters with the hon. Gentleman. The progress that we have made today is certainly not in line with the precedent which we established last time we discussed a Scottish matter in the Committee. My briefing tells me to resist the amendment. I must say that I am rather persuaded by the case cited by the hon. Gentleman, which I did get involved in at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely convinced that the LEC was without fault, although I agree that none of the parties in that particular affair distinguished themselves. The scheme that concerned the hon. Gentleman was that of a gardening project involving mentally handicapped people at Lennox Castle hospital. I spent a good part of half a day trying to sort that out and it was sorted out in the end within the existing rules. I am briefed to say that I resist the amendment because it is not necessary, which seems to be borne out by that case. I recall that it was an extremely complicated and dificult dispute. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that perhaps the position is not as clear as it ought to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not meet its intended purpose, but that is not why the hon. Gentleman tabled it. He tabled it in order to raise the issue. I should be happy to give the Committee an undertaking to look at this issue, with a view to returning to it on Report. Having spoken against my brief I shall have to consult colleagues, but I think that that is a promise upon which the hon. Gentleman can rely.

It is important that LECs—it is only LECs that we are talking about in this respect because of the Scottish legislation—acknowledge the responsibilities which they have to people who have disabilities, learning difficulties and handicaps. It is not just a matter of being concerned with high-tech, enterprise and other issues which are, perhaps, more dominant in the debate. The hon.
