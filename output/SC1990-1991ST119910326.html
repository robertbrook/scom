	<div class='legislation'>Draft Scottish Power Plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Scottish Power Plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss also the other orders before us, namely, the Revenue Support Grant (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991, the Draft Scottish Nuclear Limited (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991, the Draft Mines and Quarries (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft Mercury Communications Ltd. (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft Lochaber Power Company (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft Industrial and Freight Transport (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft Glasgow Underground (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft Electricity Generators (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991, the Draft Caravan Sites and Pitches (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft British Telecommunications Plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft British Railways Board (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft British Gas Plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft British Alcan Primary and Recycling Ltd. (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991, the Draft Water Undertakings (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1991 and the Draft Scottish Hydro-Electric Plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always a great pleasure, Mr. Hogg, to see you in the Chair. I hope that, under your ever-excellent chairmanship, the orders will receive a smooth, safe and speedy passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifteen of the 16 orders relate to the valuation of non-domestic property. One prescribes the level of derating to apply to caravan sites and pitches with retrospective effect from 1 April 1990. Two continue the present derating but at a lower level for industrial and freight transport lands and heritages and for mines and quarries with effect from 1 April 1991. Twelve orders prescribe the levels of rateable value to apply to the so-called formula valued industries, again with effect from 1 April 1991. The final order distributes additional revenue support grant to those authorities which suffered a shortfall of non-domestic rate income in 1989–90.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first and last of these orders will probably be of special interest to Members of the Committee. The first deals with caravans. After the simultaneous revaluations in Scotland, and in England and Wales, that took effect from 1 April 1990, it became clear that harmonisation had not been achieved in the valuation of caravan sites and pitches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Scottish values remained significantly higher, even in the case of those static leisure caravans that already qualified for 40 per cent. derating. To achieve harmonisation, we have decided to increase to 60 per cent. the level of derating applicable to caravans and to extend that derating to all caravans and their pitches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure Members of the Committee that the industrial derating and the formulae for valuation contained in the orders were the subject of formal consultation with the industries involved, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Assessors Association. We received no substantive comments on the revised values, which are fair and reasonable assessments for those industries. I commend them to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the Revenue Support Grant (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991. I mentioned that Order at the beginning of my speech on the evening of 13 February when the House considered the Revenue Support Grant (Scotland) Order 1991, which dealt with the revenue support grant settlement for 1991–92. On that occasion, our plans to introduce the No. 2 Order were warmly welcomed by the hon. Members for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) and for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Lambie). I hope that the Committee will have little difficulty in approving the order this morning. If it does, it will be just about possible to ensure that the extra grant is paid to the relevant authorities by the end of this financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will distribute an extra £16·54 million to certain authorities that suffered a shortfall of non-domestic rate income in 1989–90. The main beneficiaries will be Strathclyde region and Glasgow district. Following representations from the hon. Members for Cunninghame, North and for Cunninghame, South, I am glad to say that it has been possible for Cunninghame district council to benefit from the order. There had been technical problems which have been resolved and Cunninghame district will receive £407,000. I commend the orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hogg. Believe it, or not, I have not served on a Committee with you in the Chair—except, of course, the Scottish Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to see the Minister in his place, as these have been a fraught couple of weeks for him. He returned to his ministerial position only recently, but I gather that over the past two weeks he has been close to giving it up yet again. We have this hotch-potch of a new tax that is being put in place without any figures or facts only because the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends threatened to resign if the Government did not retain the poll tax in some form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The order before us is the draft Scottish Power Plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991 which, as far as I am aware, contains no reference to ministerial resignations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it does not, Mr. Hogg. You are quite right. However, the orders—in particular, the draft Revenue Support Grant (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991—relate to local government finance, an issue about which there were some problems in the Scottish Office—indeed, one might say that there was a minor crisis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to tell the hon. Gentleman that my hon. Friend the Minister came to my house at the weekend—he had no other watering hole, and certainly no better one—to promote what I believe will be a great project for agriculture and industry in Scotland. So my hon. Friend is anything but retiring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. and learned Gentleman has suffered injuries which, he has reliably informed me, were sustained cutting down trees. Was the Minister helping his hon. and learned Friend? Was he perhaps following the good Gladstonian tradition and getting rid of his repressed anger by chopping down trees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that we are debating the orders is a victory for the Opposition. At one time we said that we would debate each order in turn on the Floor of the House, and that would have been our right. Luckily, the Government conceded to our wishes. We shall debate national testing on the Floor of the House after Easter and, as a result, we kindly agreed to take the orders together in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that uprating is standard. However, some of the electricity orders for this year were debated only two or three weeks ago, yet we now have to consider them again. That seems slightly unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) may say a few words about the effect of the second order on Cunninghame district and the increase in money that it will receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a great pity that there is no Member of the Scottish National party in Committee this morning. People are being dismissed from their posts in that party for refusing to pay the poll tax. What a remarkable turnaround. [HON. MEMBERS: "What about the Labour party?"] The Labour party has never dismissed anyone for not paying the poll tax. We allow people to act according to their individual consciences, unlike the Scottish National party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the hon. Gentleman is alluding to the fact that a certain Kenny McAskill was not allowed to speak at the conference at the weekend. We understand that he has now been dismissed, which is not surprising considering what has gone on regarding orders of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know whether or not Mr. McAskill was allowed to speak at a conference over the weekend. However, one thing is absolutely certain: he is not a member of this Committee and his departure from a post, real or imaginary, is not covered by the draft Scottish Power Plc (Rateable Values) (Scotland) (No. 2) Order 1991, which we are supposed to be debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what you are saying, Mr. Hogg. However, the hon. Gentleman is wrong—events have moved on. Mr. McAskill was asked whether he would pay his poll tax and told that if he did not, he would have to stand down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the orders, which are necessary. We naturally welcome any increase in revenue support grant. It is just a pity that the £500 million that is coming to Scotland, presumably in revenue support grant, in the next couple of months could not have come a little earlier. Then we should not have needed to go through a Bill in a mad dash this evening but could have debated it a little more at leisure. Presumably the matter will eventually be dealt with through some form of revenue support grant. I welcome the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
orders and look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North has to say about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the caravan sites and pitches order. My hon. Friend the Minister will know of my interest in these matters and how in earlier Parliaments I pursued the problems of the differentials that existed in Scotland in contrast to England and Wales. I welcome this measure as it is an example of the Government's moving swiftly to deal with an anomaly that needed to be rectified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long. Somewhat uncharacteristically, I have come to praise Caesar rather than to bury him. I am extremely grateful for the understanding and co-operation that has been shown by both the Minister and his civil servants in recognising that Cunninghame had been the victim of an inadvertent wrong due to the way in which the money was distributed. The fact that some legislative trouble has been taken to right that wrong is appreciated by me, by my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, South (Mr. Lambie), by the local authority and of course by the ratepayers, or should they be called poll tax payers, of Cunninghame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a nice neutral, interim term to describe the people of Cunninghame who, to some extent, will be the ultimate beneficiaries of the order this morning. It would also be proper to put matters in context by saying that I welcome the source of the problem which is the fact that some of the major industrial ratepayers in my constituency and in other parts of Scotland are the beneficiaries of the successor valuation appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want principally to thank the Minister and the civil servants and to express satisfaction with the outcome. However, as I am on my feet anyway I might as well say that I find the travails of the Scottish National party highly relevant to this morning's debate. When I started reading about sendings off, disputes, sackings and all the rest I thought that I was reading a report of the Celtic v. Rangers match and that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) has become a veritable Souness. All that poor Mr. McAskill has been doing for the past two or three years is following party policies and going round the country telling people not to pay. Yet, as we all know, the poll tax has not been abolished. We have the word of the right hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) to confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that 70 per cent. of the population do not believe that the poll tax has been abolished but that the 30 per cent. who do believe that it has been abolished include the hon. Members for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Sillars) and for Banff and Buchan and 200 delegates to a Scottish National Party conference. Who is kidding whom? We shall be able to derive a great deal of entertainment from this in the weeks and months ahead. I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, for your indulgence. Who knows, my remarks may even turn up in another form in the 
	<i>Cumbernauld News and Kilsyth Chronicle.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not add to the toast to absent friends that we have heard from Labour Members. May I thank the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and assure him that having just got back into the Scottish Office I have no intention of resigning. I have no idea whether he will consider that good or bad news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders refer to the forthcoming year. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North who has pursued the problems of the differential on rating caravans north and south of the border with great assiduity over a long period of time. On behalf of the civil servants in the Department may I express our gratitude to the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) the problem was identified and much work was done to resolve it. I am glad that the feeling of the Committee is to accept the orders before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
