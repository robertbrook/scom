	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue where I left off this morning when in full flow. I had explained that this was a probing amendment, but the Government were giving cause for concern with their attitude on freedom of association. I was about to illustrate how the Government are using evidence selectively to support their argument. Last week the Minister twice referred to comments about alien practices by a now retired trade union official. The same Minister had nodded vigorously in support of his hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) during the recent debate on unemployment when reference was made to the agreement between union members and the company at Toray Textiles and MSF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot have their bread buttered on both sides. That tends to be messy, rather like the clause. Unions are not the monolithic organisations which the Government portray. Agreements between employers and lcoal groups of members should remain local issues. The law should not interfere with their activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had much experience of conducting ballots under Conservative legislation, prior to the introduction of the legal requirements. I have sometimes been asked by members—usually a minority of members—to appoint a scrutineer to ensure fair play and, being the will of the membership in question, that was done. I challenge the Government to find one incident in which I failed in my past life to meet the legal requirements. I have conducted such practices for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only time I had difficulties was when dealing with zealots and fundamentalists—otherwise known as members of the Conservative Trade Unionists organisation. Using the instinct of greed that is part of the Government's "I'm all right, Jack" culture, they wanted to strike now and ask questions later, but more sensible members kept them on the straight and narrow. Perhaps the Government are getting their ideas about trade union activities from Conservatives who do not consider the issues in the context of the broader trade union movement but from their own narrow, self-interested point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
The Minister said this morning that he was at a loss to understand why our earlier amendments, which differentiated by numbers in the workplace, should apply. He could not understand the logic of that. The Minister is not the sole arbiter of reason. I am presenting an alternative way of operating which is logical and consistent and which has the benefit of flexibility, which would enable ballots to be conducted to suit the prevailing circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the Minister that failure to consider a more flexible arrangement will cause difficulties from my experience of conducting such matters, it will promote wildcat action in cases in which time is of the essence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background against which I present the amendments. I hope that the Government will listen carefully to my arguments and, in conjunction with the earlier debate, give some ground on this important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mclaughlin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's comments. I do not, however, believe that the amendment would allow or, indeed, represent a satisfactory alternative to the fully postal ballot that we are proposing in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide trade unions with a choice of how to conduct voting in an industrial action ballot, and we believe that that is unacceptable. The amendment would not, however, change the provisions in a way which would reassure voters about the proper conduct of a workplace ballot, nor would it allow voters to cast their vote away from the particular pressures to which they might otherwise be subject if voting took place in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would argue that a workplace ballot, supervised by the scrutineer, would be as acceptable in ensuring its proper conduct as a fully postal ballot. However, the function of an industrial action ballot scrutineer is not to supervise the ballot. His purpose is to observe and report to the union by whom he is appointed on matters specified in section 231 relating to the conduct of the ballot. The amendment would, therefore, alter the scrutineer's role in a way which has very marked and, I believe, wholly undesirable consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1990 code of practice "Trade Union Industrial Action Ballots" and the 1987 Green Paper "Trade Unions and Their Members" referred to the possible merits of workplace industrial action ballots in certain circumstances. However, both references clearly implied that workplace voting in industrial action ballots is very much a second best option. We do not believe that it is right or proper to ask trade union members to settle for second best. That is why we are fully committed to implementing the clause as it stands. I believe that it will vastly improve trade union members' understanding of what is happening in their union and their view on how they should cast their vote, as well as enabling them so to do by a fully postal ballot. Therefore, I cannot recommend that the Committee accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my remarks this morning, I emphasised that this is a probing amendment and I commented on the letter that was given to members of the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
last week. In the light of the contents of that letter, and because the amendment would mean that further costs could be incurred by trade unions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>NOTICE OF BALLOT AND SAMPLE VOTING PAPER FOR
<br><br><!-- lb --> EMPLOYERS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 28, line 20, leave out from "inserted—" to end and add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"'226A. The trade union shall take steps to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that all employers whose workers are entitled to vote in the ballot have been informed that the ballot is taking place.'.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment applies to clause 15 which can be best described as the employers' charter. Once again in the Bill, the balance is wrong. We have constantly said that whenever there are two sides to a case, the Government's duty is to try and remain unbiased and fair in imposing duties and rights on each side. Once again, the bias is entirely against the trade unions, imposing on them duties but not conferring on them the rights that such duties should incur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By throwing several stringent conditions before the trade unions, the Bill represents another attempt by the Government to try to allow employers to question the validity of the ballot and, therefore, to make the ballots and, as a consequence, industrial action far more difficult to pursue. Once again, the power of the trade unions is reduced. It is not a question of banning trade unions; even this Government would not be silly enough to do that, although there is their record at GCHQ. The Government are trying to neuter trade union power in two ways. First, they impose restriction after restriction that makes it difficult for trade unions to act. Secondly, they ensure that the unions' income is removed and that the costs are increased. That is a double whammy to undermine the trade unions' role. The clause would enable that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it necessary to introduce this provision? The Minister spoke of the 1990 code of practice on balloting for industrial action which referred to good practice. That good practice is what we are considering today. The Government intend to damage the ability of the unions to take effective action. They set up one hurdle. When the unions got over that, they set up another, and so on. The Government believed that if there were ballots on industrial action, no one would vote for it. They were proved to be wrong, so they now want to impose full postal ballots. When that does not work, they will introduce other regulations to make effective action more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls), the Minister at the time of the 1990 code of practice, said that the law on industrial ballots was working well and that he could see no reason to change it. The Government have given no reason why a change is now necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
The clause has three subsections. Our amendment would delete most of it. The amendment deals with giving notice of a ballot. It must be a totally incompetent employer who does not realise that a ballot on industrial action is taking place which will affect him. When notice of a ballot on industrial action arrives one morning on the employer's desk and he asks his secretary whether there is any mail, to which she replies that there is going to be a ballot on industrial action, I cannot believe that he will then say, "I realised the world was flat, but I did not realise that there was going to be a ballot." That is not logical. If an employer does not know that that is happening he is not competent to be an employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the clause is concerned with what should be on a ballot paper. The provision would cause delay. It would also give the employer the opportunity to find reasons to delay industrial action. It is always the workers and their organisations that are wrong and the employers that are always right—every advantage should be given to the employers, but nothing should be given to the workers. We dispute that philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most sinister part of the clause is concerned with giving information on the employees. We shall deal with that in another amendment. This amendment would remove all those requirements in the clause and would insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The trade union shall take steps to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that all employers whose workers are entitled to vote in the ballot have been informed that the ballot is taking place."</p></blockquote>
That is being nice to the employers, on the offchance that there might be an employer who is on holiday in the Bahamas while his workers are slaving away for pittance wages and who might not know about the ballot. One or two trade unionists could fly out, at Government expense, to deliver the message. We are prepared to leave in that provision for the benefit of employers, but we want all the sinister provisions struck out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard to work out which of the clauses in the Bill is the most transparently vindictive. Perhaps clause 15 comes closest. That clause has nothing to do with whether it is a good or bad idea to ballot before strike action and has nothing to do with the various kinds of ballot that we discussed in clause 14. It does nothing to encourage participation or democracy. It is about one thing and one thing only. In circumstances when there might be an industrial dispute, it gives the employer the right to ensure that, as far as is possible—irrespective of the dispute's cause or whether it is right or wrong—he can legally conclude the dispute in his interests alone. The dispute would not be concluded by negotiation, persuasion or cajoling but, if negotiations were in danger of breaking down, the employer would be given the right to interfere. Normally the trade union and its members would sort out such a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, responsible employers regard themselves as negotiators who try to avoid industrial disputes and the necessity for any kind of action. The clause will not help that process one iota. It will give a leg up to employers who do not want to go through the hassle of negotiation nor of talking to their employees. It will give them the right to interfere, intimidate and victimise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
The employer will be able to have advance notice, not just of action to be taken but of action that employees might consider taking. The employer would be allowed to know who was involved and where they were. Why does an employer need that information at the discussion phase, unless it is to enable and encourage the employer to interfere in the process and the democratic discussions which take place among trade unions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the Government's talk about ballots and the need to have members informed and to let them have their say free from intimidation, would be completely undermined by the clause. The clause is yet another example of classic double standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employer can interfere in discussions about whether employees should take particular courses of action. Where is the suggestion in this legislation, or in any legislation that has been passed by the Government, that that kind of principle could work both ways? For example, where is the information that, before a company board meeting, the employee should be supplied with a copy of the agenda and be told who will be present? There is no suggestion of such a provision, nor is it suggested that, before any decisions are made about dismissals, employees have to know what is under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when employees want to decide what to do, suddenly the full force of the law is used to ensure that the employer has the right to know in advance what will be discussed. No aspect of the Bill, nor of most other legislation that has been introduced, gives employees legal safeguard against intimidation by a vindictive employer in the run-up to a strike ballot or some other industrial action ballot. There is nothing to protect them. The land of Big Brother certainly seems to be alive and well in clause 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if Conversative Members take no notice of what the Opposition have said about how it is not just employers' rights that count but those of employees too, sooner or later they will have to take notice of what other people say. Britain is already in trouble under the ILO convention. The impact of Government legislation has already been discussed by the ILO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is unamended, the right to freedom of association, which Opposition members of the Committee have frequently referred to but about which Conservative members have not given adequate reassurances, will come to the fore again. The sole purpose of the clause is to give information to an employer that is not relevant to the conduct of the ballot by the trade union and can only be relevant to an employer who wants to interrupt the union's business. The clause has no place in a democracy nor in industrial relations. I hope that, at least in this case, the Government will understand that they have overstepped the mark and will agree to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mclaughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) let the cat out of the bag when he said that the amendment's purpose was to strike out most of the clause. I do not think that he will be surprised to hear that I am not inclined to recommend that the amendment be accepted by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision was clearly set out on page 14, paragraph 325, of the Green Paper that preceded publication of the Bill. The clause is taken more or less word for word from the Green Paper. Were the amendment accepted, unions
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
proposing to conduct an industrial action ballot would have to do their best to tell the employers of the members concerned of that general intention. However, they would not—as we believe they should—have to give notice of the expected opening day of the ballot; describe those who are likely to be given entitlement to vote, so that the employer knows which of his employees may be involved; or provide sample voting papers to the employers. We believe those provisions to be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under current law, a union is free to organise an industrial action ballot without providing any notice to the employer of members to be balloted. Similarly, although the law applies certain requirements to the content of voting papers, there is no requirement for the union to provide a sample voting paper to the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an employer's workers are to be balloted about industrial action, he should be aware of that. Just as the union is free to recommend to voters that they should vote yes in the ballot, the employer should have the chance, if he wishes, to put the contrary case. Therefore he needs to know that a ballot is going to happen, when the union intends to begin the ballot and who the union expects to be able to vote. The clause will give employers the right to such information but the amendment would take it away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) asks why we would not take the Opposition at their word and why we do not listen to them on these particular points that they feel that they know so much more about than the Government. The Opposition have told us, time and time again, that each piece of trade union legislation introduced by the Government would not work. Yet we have seen that the legislation that has been introduced has worked to the benefit of trade union members. That is one reason why we find it hard to take the hon. Gentleman at his word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion is not that the clause would not work but that it may work in pursuit of an entirely reprehensible purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister feels that employers should have the right to information about who is being balloted, what the ballot is about and on what date it will be held, can he provide any rights for employees who could then be intimidated by employers about which way they should vote? There are no rights against intimidation that I can see in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about those who might be intimidated by union bully-boy tactics which have been witnessed in the past during industrial action? The hon. Gentleman shakes his head in total disgust, but such strikes are not beyond the living memory of many of us in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the Green Paper's recommendations on an employer's right to have information on a strike ballot. Can he confirm that the Green Paper referred to a variety of different balloting procedures that could be used in cases of industrial action and that that included postal and workplace ballots?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Green Paper to which I referred trailed the idea of postal ballots. As we have discussed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
many times, the Green Paper to which I am referring mentioned the possibility of postal ballots for cases in which more than 50 members are to be balloted. As I said earlier, since the Green Paper was published, our election manifesto made it clear that we want postal ballots for all industrial disputes. Therefore, I refer the hon. Gentleman to the Green Paper which was published last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northfield said that the clause was the most vindictive part to the Bill. He has been using that word a lot in his speeches. He seems to find every clause the most vindictive. No doubt he will say it about the next clause on which he speaks. I think that the clause provides an important right and strengthens the conduct of ballots. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said in his honest opening remarks that the impact of the amendment would be to wipe out most of the clause. He will not, therefore be surprised if I suggest that we do not accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having heard the Minister's explanation, I am even more determined to press the amendment to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked for the reasons behind the clause. Why does the employer have to be given notice of ballots? Why does he have to be told who is involved? Why does he have to be given a copy of the ballot paper? The Minister says that the reason is that he and his party believe that to be right. Someone's belief does not make something right. The Minister might believe that he is the slimmest person in the Committee but that does not mean that he is right. I think that he will understand the basic philosophical point that I am trying to make. I am prepared to withdraw that comment, Mr. Hogg. The Minister might believe that he is the fattest person on the Committee but, again, he could be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every time that we ask the Government for the reason behind a clause, they answer that they believe that it is right. There is no justification and no reasoned or logical argument explaining what the clause sets out to achieve, why that needs to be achieved, what the problems are or what steps will be taken to achieve the aims of the clause. Time and again, the Government say that that is what they believe. They believe that it is Wednesday when it is Tuesday. That does not work as a basis for the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is an attack on the trade unions. It is biased against them and their functions. As my hon. Friends have said, the onus is always on the trade unions. The Minister says that the employer should be able to put his case. I am not stopping that, but the trade unions should not be required to give him every opportunity to do that, or to make it easier for him to do that. My hon. Friend the Member for Northfield said that employees do not have access to information about disciplinary action, or about when board meetings will be held so that they can put their case on the policy of the company. For those reasons, we have no hesitation in pressing the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 28, line 23, leave out "seventh".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the seven-day notification that, under the clause would have to be given to employers. Again we are dealing with the mythical individual who would be unaware, as he travels around London clubs, of industrial unrest in his organisation. Not only would he have to be notified, but he would have to be given seven days notice. That would be not seven days notice of action to confirm that in a week's time the trains or the buses will be stopped, or the factory closed, but seven days notice of a ballot about industrial action. Why should an employer be entitled to know that? An argument in favour of the cooling off period, which I do not accept, concerns health and safety. That is not relevant to this matter. It would be simply another hurdle for unions to overcome—another statutory legal hurdle to make litigation against a union more likely. The employer would have a chance to litigate to delay the ballot. Unless the Minister can justify those seven days, we shall expect our amendment to be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[SIR MICHAEL NEUBERT 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Gentleman's arguments. I cannot agree to an amendment that would deny an employer a reasonable period of notice that the employees are to be balloted about whether they want to take industrial action. It is not an outrageous requirement to demand that notice be given before a ballot takes place. There are a number of subsequently linked amendments where we will be discussing the seven-day period and the three-day period. As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, that is separate from the seven-day period of notice for industrial action following a ballot, which we will discuss later. The demand is reasonable; it is not onerous or bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In balloting its members about industrial action, the union is free to make a recommendation to those members on how they should vote in that ballot. However, the employer may also want the opportunity to give information to voters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable a union to deny the employers of those to be balloted—who are, in a very real sense, involved in that decision—the chance to communicate with their employees about the effect that any subsequent industrial action might have. Informing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
employers about the ballot on the day before it is held, as could be the case if this amendment were accepted, is not a sufficient or reasonable period of notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1991 Green Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If workers of a particular employer are entitled to vote in an industrial action ballot, that employer should have the right to information about the ballot."</p></blockquote>
We believe that it is right and proper to provide employers with such information. That is why the Green Paper notified our intention to require trade unions to provide employers with notice of holding an industrial action ballot, and with a copy of the voting paper to be used for that ballot. That will not be onerous on the union and I cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I ever suggested that the provision was onerous or bureaucratic. I am asking the Minister why it is necessary. He did better than to refer to his mystical belief and produced a reason, but I want to know what follows the seven-day period. What will the employer do? The Minister let the cat out of the bag by saying that the employer will try to intimidate the employees—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the Minister want to intervene? I was using a little licence, as the Minister does when he refers to bully boys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to employers influencing their employees, but they may want to intimidate then-employees. Why should the employer be given seven days' notice? If there is a conflict, both sides should try, within the law, to maximise their strengths and advantages. Employers are under no obligation to make information available to trade unions, so why should trade unions be under an obligation to do so? The provision refers not to industrial action but simply to a ballot concerning industrial action. Once again the advantage will be given to the employer. If notice must be given why should it be seven days? Why should it not be six days or five days? The only reason for the notice is to give the employer time to intimidate the employees. The provision will be part of an intimidatory employers' charter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am curious to know why Conservative Members have become Seventh Day Adventists in this context. The Minister referred to the need for seven days' notice, but it was accepted that the seven-day obligation would be removed from the Bill. It is not as though employers would have no notice of a union's intention to ballot. In the real world of industrial relations rather than the editorial in 
	<i>The Daily Telegraph,</i> to which I referred earlier, strikes do not happen suddenly. Employers do not suddenly find that there is a ballot in the workplace. Any industrial action, or threat of it, will almost certainly be the consequence of a dispute—perhaps on the terms and conditions of employment, discipline, or health and safety—and the employer will know that there has been a breakdown in relationships. Against the background of failed negotiations, which the unions and the employers will know about, the seven-day notice period looks peculiar and out of context with the rest of the Minister's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause affects the immunities that are enjoyed by trade unions in common law. There can be no doubt that the imposition of a seven-day notice period would have a bearing on any civil proceedings that an employer might
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
bring against a union in order to claim damages for an industrial dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seven-day notice period is designed to facilitate the bringing of legal action to allow the employer to take a union to court if there has been any technical or marginal deficiency in providing that seven-day notice period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, our confusion is where the seven days come from. Why seven days? Is not this a further example of a mechanistic and bureaucratic obstacle to the organisation of a fair ballot on the conduct and course of an industrial dispute? The seven-day period is incoherent in the context of the Bill and in that of the Minister's response to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with the second part of the clause. The first part concerned the notification of the ballot about to take place. The amendments deal with the employer being provided with the ballot paper within certain stipulations, not many of which we disagree with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments are the same—we have rehearsed them so there is no need for me to go through them once again. If an employer wished to obtain a ballot paper, I am sure that that would be no problem. I am sure that he could ask the unions and that they would be pleased to oblige him. The problem is that the clause places a statutory obligation on the union, without any subsequent rights and no statutory obligation on the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the employer do with the ballot paper? Will he try to amend it, or use it to intimidate members or to pursue vexatious legal action, or to try to damage the union? What duties are imposed on the employer? Again, the answer is absolutely none. The clause is another example of one-sided legislation where statutory duties are placed on the trade unions. Why are employers demanding that that happen? Are not they happy to go to the trade union, if they wish, and request a ballot paper? Why, once again, are statutory duties and obligations placed on trade unions and not on employers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. sMcLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, the clause concerns the right of an employer to receive within three days before a ballot a copy of the ballot paper. The amendment would remove that provision. The proposal attracted strong support from employers, employers' associations and other organisations. I do not understand why the Opposition find the proposal onerous or why they want to remove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To have protection from proceedings for calling for industrial action, a union must hold a properly conducted ballot. Among the requirements for such a ballot, the voting papers must make clear whether members are being asked if they are prepared to take part in industrial action which consists of a strike or of action short of strike. They must specify the person, or a description of persons, who the union intends to have authority to call for industrial action to which the ballot relates. They must include, without qualification or comment, the words:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you take part in a strike or other industrial action, you may be in breach of your contract of employment".</p></blockquote>
The provisions of the Bill will require further detail. For example, voting papers will have to give details of the ballot scrutineer and the address to which they are to be returned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an employer were not able to see a sample voting paper, he might have no way of knowing whether the voting paper used for a ballot complied with the requirements of the law. The clause proposes to give employers the right to receive a sample voting paper, precisely for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted it would deny employers that right. I think that a sample voting paper should go to the employer. The union should have nothing to hide if it has complied properly with the law. If there is a problem with the voting paper, the provision may help to sort it out before voting takes place. The three-day period is reasonable and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment. If he is unable to do that, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 28, line 34, after "notice", insert "delivered either verbally or".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the point which I made earlier—it was also made by my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), about giving notification of a ballot. We are supposed to believe that an employer can be involved in industrial discussions without foreseeing that industrial action will take place. Suddenly, out of the blue, for no obvious reason, an employee will wake up and say, "What shall I do today? I know, let's have a ballot on industrial action." That cannot be the case. Employers must know what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provisions would impose an unnecessary statutory obligation on the trade unions. The amendment aims to modify the clause. We do not want unions not to have to provide notification, but to provide notice that is "delivered either verbally or in writing".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade union must be in constant contact with the employer. Decisions are not made out of the blue. Meetings take place about grievances. When such discussions have taken place, it must be right for the trade union to say to the employer, "We've exhausted that method and we have no other recourse but to seek industrial action. We therefore intend to ballot our members on industrial action."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is such a procedure wrong? Why must there be a statutory obligation to notify employers in writing, when everyone must be aware of what is happening? A verbal notice is non-bureaucratic. It makes it easier for the employer and the trade union to agree that, if they are happy, there will be a ballot on industrial action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government believe that employers should, in future, have a right to information
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
about a prospective industrial action ballot, as set out in new section 226A(2). We also believe that the terms of the new section make it perfectly practicable for a union to take the required steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, however, aims to allow a union to do no more than tell an employer the relevant details, without putting them in writing. That would increase the scope for confusion about whether a union had, or had not, provided the required details about its beliefs and intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 226A requires a union to
	<br><blockquote><p>"take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure"</p></blockquote>
that the details set out in section 226A(2) are received by the employer. Moreover, the union would have to supply details about, first, its intention to hold the ballot and, secondly, its reasonable belief, at a particular point in time, about the opening date of the ballot and the employees who would be entitled to vote in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital that the employer has a written record of the information which the union has supplied to him about the provision of those details. Without such a record, the employer would never be sure about the accuracy of his understanding of them, nor would there be any common record to which both the employer and the union could refer, if necessary, at a later stage.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have reached one of the most sinister parts of the clause. I shall not call it vindictive because we have used that word many times. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that there is nothing sinister and that the clause would not trap or ensnare. If he reassures us, we shall withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he does not, we shall vote for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is based upon the Government's belief that employers are stupid and ignorant of what is happening.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
Therefore, the trade unions must help them. In other words, trade unions are the assistants of stupid, ignorant employers. The Government think that employers have no idea when a ballot is being conducted, or when there is industrial trouble and that, one day, completely out of the blue, that information will be slapped on the manager's desk and he will say, "Oh dear, I must cancel my trip to the golf club this afternoon because a ballot is taking place."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some reason, the Government think that, if there is a discussion with the trade unions about an industrial dispute, the employers will have no idea who is involved and that the trade unions must tell them. That is one of my objections, but I have another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is meant by,
	<br><blockquote><p>"setting out a description of the employees"?</p></blockquote>
Does that include their sex, weight or their colour? I do not have to introduce too many ridiculous examples to make my point. Nowadays, trade unions are faced with a vast array of statutes to consider before they take industrial action. As that vast array is enlarged by this legislation, it is increasingly likely that a trade union will fall short of a statute, not by design but by accident, leaving it open to challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A trade union could be challenged for not setting out in the notice an adequate description of the employees involved. Unless we know what the Minister means by an adequate description, trade unions will not know what to put in the notice. Should they include their trades, height, weight? Unless we get it right, that will be a prime reason for involving trade unions in litigation, not to prevent a strike from going ahead but, if there is a strike, to seek compensation from the trade union under clause 19. Therefore it is important that the Minister tells us what should be included in the description.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 79 would delete from clause 15 the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"from which their identities can readily be ascertained by the employer."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that a trade union must provide the names of the people who will be balloted? If so, that is sinister. The Government are doing the work of the Economic League. Why should an employer be told the names of those who will be involved in industrial action so that he can intimidate them or take action against them? Is it the purpose of the clause that names should be given to employers, leaving members open to intimidation? What if an employee who is a member of a union does not wish his name to be given to his employer? Will the trade union be in breach of any rule, regulation or statute by giving his name to his employer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I was going to make that very point Just because a member has taken part in a ballot does not necessarily mean that he voted for industrial action.

	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
legislation to make that information available only to employers and not to trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had better redeem myself as quickly as possible and emphasise, for the benefit of Conservative Members, that thoughts of my conversion on the road to Damascus are premature. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden in moving amendment No. 61.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a legitimate question to be asked about the intention behind the clause. I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to some of the important questions posed by my hon. Friend. We must be aware of the realities of industrial relations. When industrial relations go wrong—in a minority of cases, fortunately—a stage can be reached that is almost like a war. Employers' use of law passed in the 1980s by successive Conservative Governments—I refer particularly to the print disputes of the mid-1980s, which my father, as a member of the National Graphical Association, experienced first hand—amounted to a conspiracy to break-up a firm. Loopholes—or perhaps the intentional provisions of the Government's legislation—were exploited to the maximum to allow print workers to be sacked en masse for taking industrial action and to make it virtually impossible, by artificial divisions of the business, for workers to picket what was effectively their place of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that Conservative Members could deny that, if lines are drawn, a stage of strategic battle is reached between the work force and the employer. Relations become strained and industrial action is taken. The clause, unamended, would require the trade union side in such a situation to hand over all its plans to the management side in advance. It would be like trying to fight the second world war only once Hitler's permission could be obtained to advance and land at Dunkirk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If fairness is under consideration care must be taken when examining the clause. I am particularly worried about the potential—and I put it no more strongly than that, but it should be taken seriously—for victimisation and intimidation of an employee by an employer. Later in the Bill, at clause 24, the Government implicitly admit that perhaps such intimidation and victimisation could arise and be directed at someone who is trying only to control and regulate health and safety. There is no protection in the clause now being considered for individual workers who may have to decide whether to take industrial action. The very requirement for a trade union to give an employer details—perhaps even individual details—of who is to be balloted is intimidatory, without the employer having to do anything. Increasingly in the 1980s employers have visited arbitrary action upon employees and attempted to influence ballots in progress by writing to employees at their home addresses. The clause contains no mention of any control on that sort of activity and it does not attempt to regulate intimidatory letters that are sent directly to the homes of those taking part in the ballot. That is unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
History has shown the lengths to which some firms facing serious industrial action will go to intimidate their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
work forces. Previous legislation has stripped away any rights that individual employees had. They may be selectively dismissed once they have gone on strike. If the ingredients are added together, it is a serious position that offers an unscrupulous employer a worryingly large number of opportunities to intimidate and victimise individual members of his work force. Employees are in a vulnerable position and it is the duty of the law to protect the work force as well as to place responsibilities on to trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fundamental flaw in subsection 2(2)(c). I have worked in factories in which not everyone in a squad was a member of a trade union, and in others in which people were members of different trade unions. However, those people are not excluded when a problem occurs. For example, in the past an electrician, a joiner and a plumber could belong to different trade unions, but the predominant union was the Amalgamated Engineering Union. Never in its wildest dreams would it, when making a squad decision, exclude members of other trade unions from the right to take part in a vote on an issue, especially if it involved industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister has thought of where those folk who are not in unions come in. Does he sincerely believe that decisions on the shop floor should exclude people who are not members of a union? I hope that he understands my point because if he does not, the serious flaw will remain in the Bill. If the Minister has any doubt about what I am saying, I would be delighted to clarify the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(c) is a possible charter for bullyboy employers. I was surprised to hear the Minister, who has spoken at length about the sensitivity of the Bill—he said that his was not an anti-trade union Bill—refer to bullyboy trade unions. He has never said that there are bad bullyboy employers, but we all know of them. I could stand here all day and list them, but that is not my job in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an example of the flaw in the Bill. Can the Minister imagine five or six shops in which some of the staff for religious reasons, are not members of trade unions? Would they be able to take part in the decision—making process among the collectivity of the workers? The Government demand that the employer should know the affiliation of everybody he employs, but some of those who are not in unions would be prepared to accept the vote of the majority. However, not all trade union members should need to notify their employers that they are members of a union. Not all of them do; that is their democratic right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very worrying that a trade union that is calling on its members to vote should have to get in touch with employers, with the result that those members may be isolated. In a small workplace, where two or three workers may not belong to a union and one does, does that trade union member have the right to vote? That member would be so exposed to the employer that a decision could be made to reject a trade union's collective decision because sacking one member of staff, who would have no support, would not be difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such things happen; discrimination does take place. There is a famous organisation, the Freedom Association, which makes a real profession of that. It has set about
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
gathering the names of trade union members and sending them out to employers. If employers request information about a person the organisation may advise against hiring him or her because of previous union involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is fatally flawed. It does not acknowledge the position of trade union members who are in the minority at the workplace. If the Minister does not understand my argument, I am prepared to elaborate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make only a couple of brief points. First, subsection (2)(2)(c) begins with the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"setting out a description of the employees who it is reasonable for the union to believe".</p></blockquote>
That is badly drafted. As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden asked, what constitutes a description of an employee? Does the phrase refer to a job title or to a person's political views? Does it encompass length of membership of a trade union or a type of attitude? We must know that before we can support the clause. If the Minister can answer that question, Opposition Members may well examine their approach to the clause.

My second point is more fundamental. I have spoken about the bad drafting of subsection (2)(2)(c), but we have returned to the subject of the rights of the individual throughout our deliberations. The Conservative party is very keen on the rights of the individual, so I should welcome a defence from the Minister of the proposition that people's membership of trade unions should be communicated to their employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has discussed the right to join a trade union. If I join a trade union of my own free will, pay my subscriptions and participate in the union's activities, that amounts to a contract between me and the collective body of the union. It is not a matter for a third party. It is a private matter. If I wanted to make it public, I could walk through my factory—or office, or shop—and announce that I was a member of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers Union, or of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union or of the Transport and General Workers Union. However, if I do not want that information shared with a third party, surely it is my right to cast a vote in a postal ballot in the privacy of my home, without my employer knowing that I belong to the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's purpose in causing the employer to know about an employee's union status? Far be it from me to be cynical, but could the possibility mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden be correct? Could it be that I, as a union member, might receive a letter from my employer a couple of days before the ballot saying, "Dear Mr. Hanson, should you vote in this way X, Y and Z circumstance will befall you and your workmates."? That is undue pressure, because my right as an individual is to vote as I see fit on the issues as I see them. I would not have joined the union for any other reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should especially welcome from the Minister an inkling of why he feels that a person's freedom to privacy—to be a member of a union without an employer knowing—is not inalienable in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With many unions, a ballot could take place on, say, selective industrial action. I might work in one outlet of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
a company and union members might be involved with different outlets of the same company. I might vote for selective industrial action. Why should I, in one part of the United Kingdom and voting for a selective strike, be identified as a union member and have my membership divulged to my employer when I may wish to keep that private, for reasons of my own?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were involved in check-off, which I probably will not be after the Bill is enacted, the employer would know that I was a member of a trade union. But why should my freedom and privacy be infringed upon? I should have the right to keep secret my membership of the union, for any reason that I choose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These have been an interesting set of proposals from the Opposition on the ulterior motives that they perceive in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3.25 of the 1991 Green Paper proposed that a union which plans to hold an industrial action ballot should provide the employer, or employers, with
	<br><blockquote><p>"… details of which of his workers will be entitled to vote".</p></blockquote>
Without such information, a union notice of intent would not provide an employer with the details to which we feel he is entitled about industrial action which the union may call upon his workers to take, hence the provisions of the proposed new section 226A(2)(c). That is also the reason why the amendments are unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law provides special protection for a union which organises industrial action. If it satisfies certain statutory requirements, such as securing the support of its members in a properly-conducted ballot. The law also allows a union to put its case for industrial action to those who vote in that ballot. However, industrial action aims to put pressure on an employer. Therefore it is reasonable for the law to protect employers' rights. These should include the right of an employer to know that a union is proposing to ballot his workers, and to know which workers are likely to be involved in the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also perfectly fair to allow an employer, if he chooses, to attempt to persuade his workers to vote against industrial action. To do so, he must have an idea of which workers are involved. The amendment would deprive employers of such information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish making these points. I accept that some hon. Members wish for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential relevance of such information can easily be demonstrated by a hypothetical example. If a union intends to call for action by, say 50 drivers who are part of a larger work force of perhaps several hundred, it is of little use to an employer to be told that the union intends to ballot some of his workers. The employer needs to know, and should have the right to know, which workers the union proposes to ballot. The union would then say that it intended to ballot the drivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have said many times that in most instances the employer will know that industrial action has been proposed and is likely to take place. There is nothing new in employers putting their side of the case when a ballot is to be conducted on pay negotiations. In many of the National Union of Mineworkers ballots in which I participated, it was well established that a ballot
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
would take place on a particular offer. We would get a leaflet from the NUM which Conservative Members might say was accurate, although sometimes it left a little to be desired. We would also receive a leaflet from the Coal Board setting out what it believed to be the case.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the sort of leaflet that the Minister has in mind the one that Mr. Ian MacGregor sent to every miner during the 1984–85 dispute, which stated that there was no possibility whatever of pit closures leaving the British mining industry with as few as 50 collieries? Does he think that employers should honestly send a leaflet of that nature to employees in such circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. MacGregor's letter coloured my attitude, which is why I decided to carry on working. Some of the tactics of the National Union of Mineworkers towards people who wished to exercise their democratic right and reject strike action after having balloted also coloured my attitude. I am not prepared to say where vindictive action came from on that occasion, but it did not come from the Coal Board. We have talked about vindictive action by employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government think that it is all right for an employer to send to people who may be contemplating industrial action information that is a downright he—as Mr. MacGregor circulated at the time, knowing that it was a downright he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is for each individual to decide who to believe, after studying information from his union or his employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Antrim, East (Mr. Beggs) asked about a person's knowledge of a vote. There is no way of finding out how an individual has voted unless he declares it. Therefore there should be no specific victimisation. I accept that in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman suggested of a ballot having taken place, irrespective of how a member voted, generally he will wish to follow the majority decision. Therefore it is essential that the ballot is seen to be free, fair and truly representative of the wishes of a work force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->

An engineering squad or section could have 30 fitters who were members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. One slinger could be a member of the Transport and General Workers Union and three electricians and a plumber could be members of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication, and Plumbing Union.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has suggested the most impossible hypothesis ever. I do not believe that that would happen. The hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed at the Minister's lack of knowledge of Britain's manufacturing industries, maintenance squads and shutdown work. When workers go into factories that perhaps have been closed for a fortnight, they go in collective groups, known as engineering squads. I have already been involved in such a squad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, such groups operate as a whole. The union with the largest number of workers is the one that surfaces. How could a ballot vote take place on the basis of a dispute that would result in one union recruiting more than the rest? My intervention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intervention is long, Mr. Hogg, but I am explaining the position to the Minister and then I shall stop. The Minister is wrong: there will be hundreds upon hundreds of squads at work. Therefore, disputes could arise quickly and become complicated.

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Guided by your wise words, Mr. Hogg, I think that the hon. Gentleman is wrong. Therefore, I do not think that that would be the result. It would be for the individual unions to organise themselves correctly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister on that point. When he says, "not necessarily" who would decide what was appropriate in a specific circumstance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why we have deliberately drafted the Bill so that a description must be given that
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
will be most relevant to a particular area. There are several areas in which there would be differences. Multi-union representation has already been discussed, but in other areas there is a single union. When there is a single union, it is easy to describe who would be balloted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister appears to be saying that the Bill would make it possible for a union, under its Thatcher obligation, to give the names of the members who have balloted to an employer. The Minister said, "not necessarily", but he did not rule it out completely. He was given the opportunity to rule out completely the requirement that a union must provide the names of those of the workforce who have balloted. As the Bill stands, it is a serious infringement of an individual's civil rights and liberties if his trade union membership must be declared to his employer. The next stage will be his political party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is wrong; I do not think that he needs to be concerned. The actual wording of paragraph (c) is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"setting out a description of the employees who it is reasonable for the union to believe (at the time when the steps to comply with the paragraph are taken) will be entitled to vote in the ballot from which their identities can readily be ascertained by the employer."</p></blockquote>
In many industries the employer knows who is a member of a particular union. That is not new. In the mining industry, the employer pays subscriptions to the NUM on behalf of its members, so he will know who is a member. That also applies to the Union of Democratic Mineworkers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute that, but it is not always possible to check because an individual may pay his subscription privately, by some other means. Unions will have a statutory obligation to declare who their members are. That is an invasion of privacy and is an extremely serious infringement of civil liberties. It should not be included in employment legislation. We are worried about this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. The hon. Gentleman regards it as an important matter. I gave the example of an employer employing several hundred people. If the van drivers were to be balloted, it would be sufficient to inform the employer without saying which individuals were involved. It would be up to the employer to talk to them as a group about why they should vote against industrial action, and for the union to say why they should vote for it. The wording of the Bill provides the protection to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's point about the van drivers, but the Minister has not reassured me that there is no statutory obligation on a trade union to disclose the names of its members. It is not just a question of the infringement of civil liberties; it is a legal minefield. If unions do not provide the names, will that be challenged

I do not know whether this provision is in line with a concession that was given earlier by the Minister of State, Department of Employment. The Under-Secretary cannot give us a clear commitment that the union will not be required to name individuals.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that spirit, let me say that I shall not pursue the matter much further now. However, I urge the Minister to reflect on the entire subsection because of the political minefield presented by the word "description". It is important to know what that does not involve, but I can foresee circumstances in which an employer will tell the trade union that it has not provided an adequate description, with the result that the matter will go to the courts again. Given that names will not be included, I do not mind what the Minister comes up with, just as long as we have some measure of what the description is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One should never begin by saying that one will definitely press for a vote. Therefore, on the basis of the Minister's reassurances, and contrary to what I said earlier, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 66, in page 29, fine 11, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Any information transmitted to the employer under subsections (1) to (3) above shall not be used in any manner to interfere with conduct of the ballot.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that ballots, of which the Opposition approve, have real status. Therefore it is important that ballots are seen by the participants to be absolutely fair. Reference has been made to the transmission of information that is manifestly dishonest. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) cited a particular example. Ballots must also be seen to be free from intimidation. The Minister made that point many times. I do not disagree with him; all ballots should be free from intimidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Intimidation can be applied by many people who are party to industrial relations activities. Because of the Minister's narrow experience, he referred to a particular trade union. Of course, there is the possibility of intimidation from a wide range of sources. I believe that every member of the Committee would welcome the stamping out of intimidation from all parties. In that, I include intimidation from rogue employers, for it is clear that they exist. There are bad employers, just as there are bad Ministers and bad Opposition Back Benchers. There is good and bad in all parts of society. In the context of the debate, it is important that we should not leave the door open for rogue employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, at the general election, Chancellor Kohl had decided to tell the world that Britons should vote Labour, I am sure that the Government would have been somewhat miffed, to say the least. The sovereign state of Germany has a close relationship with this country, but we would all agree that such interference would be totally improper. Comments have been made in the House about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
the Home Office's activities in regard to Bill Clinton, but I shall not get drawn into that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Northfield drew a comparison with the activities of members of company boards. How much information that is relevant to workers and circulating in those boards should be made available? For example, should employees have advance notice of information circulating in a board about company takeovers? Incidentally, that is the practice in Holland. I would say yes to that question. If the Government were to table amendments to industrial relations legislation that would have that effect, perhaps I should have more faith in the integrity and meaning of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister outlined his position regarding the current structure of industrial relations and I noted his comments. Theoretically, if I were to accept his case, I would do so for one reason: that because an employer had been provided with information in advance under the Seventh Day Adventist rule, to which reference has been made, he could say, "I can decide that the trade union is acting outside the law and can take the necessary action to prevent the ballot going ahead". That is the Minister's logic in ensuring that the information is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of the discussion, let us accept the Minister's logic but go on to ask whether it follows that an employer has the right, on receiving such information, to interfere in the conduct of the ballot. I suggest that such logic defies common sense. To echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, that would interfere with the civil liberties of participants in the ballot. Time after time, the Government tell us that they are interested in the rights of the individual, but the clause goes against those rights, which must be protected against the possible activities of a rogue employer. I am not saying that every employer is a rogue, but examples of such abuse in society exist. We must ensure that legislation does not provide a door for potential bully-boys to go through. In that context, I am referring to rogue employers. That is why I tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying the reasoning behind his amendment. However, he probably will not be surprised to hear me advise my hon. Friends to resist it. We should not be in the business of seeking to prevent employers from taking the sort of action that he wishes to stop. It is up to a union to decide whether to hold an industrial action ballot. When it does, certain information about the ballot should be made available to employers of members who are entitled to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1984, if a union wants the special protection that the law can provide for the organisation of industrial action in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, it must first hold a properly conducted ballot. There is not much difference between Conservative Members and Opposition Members on that issue. It is now a well-accepted position. It means using a voting paper that complies with the specific requirements of the law, which ensures that the voters are asked the proper question or questions; are made aware that taking part in industrial action may involve their breaking contracts of employment; are told who may call for the action to which the ballot relates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
A union is free to recommend to its members how they should cast their votes in industrial action ballots. It can, therefore, make a case for "yes", vote if that is what it wishes to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the discussions on the previous clause, I wish to push the Minister a little further. Does he accept that the application of the clause must be considered carefully in the context of an employer who is determined with malice to interfere in the conduct of a trade union? Or does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are no circumstances in which an employer could be mischievous?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of no circumstances when what we have set out either puts the employer or the employee at a disadvantage. We have set out clearly what needs to be complied with and how it will be carried out. It will not be a ballot at a workplace, where one could suggest that the employer might put up certain notices here and there just before an individual votes. That tactic is more likely to be used to try to influence the outcome of a vote. That is one reason why a postal ballot from the member's home will be a most effective way in which to ensure that such an influence, which he may consider exists, is removed. That influence will be removed from either side of the dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister, therefore, accept that it would be fundamentally wrong within the spirit of the clause for the employer to transmit information which he knows to be dishonest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An employer must say what he believes are the consequences for an individual—if he so wishes. The employer may not wish to become involved in someone making a decision at all. If he wishes to put a point, it will be for him to put it. A union may be putting out false information. To return to the famous phrase, the golden thread of logic that runs through the Bill makes it clear that votes must be cast in privacy—perhaps in a union members' home—and that the vote must be entirely postal. There should be no doubt on either side of the Committee about what behaviour is and is not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response to my interventions has shown that we are right to be concerned about the legislation as it has been drafted. It will protect employers, who will be able to transmit information which is dishonest. A trade union could not do that, because the information would have previously been in the hands of the employer, who could take action in the courts to stop transmission. I am not in favour of the transmission of dishonest information, but I am in favour of equal treatment. The provision is not fair and reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I repeat that I am not arguing for anything other than equal treatment.

By reading the clause, we can understand the thinking behind the Government's approach to the Bill. Civil rights have beeen fundamentally cut into. I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote, but I am pleased to put on record the Opposition's concerns about the underlying meaning of the legislation and its gross interference with civil liberties.

	<div class='title'>BALLOT RESULT FOR EMPLOYERS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 29, fine 15, leave out from "inserted—" to end and add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"231 A. If, following the ballot, an employer requests, in writing, that he wishes to receive information relating to matters mentioned in section 231, the trade union shall take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that the request is complied with.".</p></blockquote>
In moving the amendment, I am tempted to describe the clause as vindictive or sinister, although when I first read it I thought that the best description of it would be petty. However, after examining it more closely, I see that it has far-reaching implications that are more serious than the word "petty" would suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause fits in with the Government's general obsession with viewing unions and their members as potential wrongdoers who have to be well and truly trammelled by as many legal requirements as possible in order to control everything that they do. My hon. friends have already referred to that and have described the many restrictions that the Governmment feel are necessary on
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
trade unions, their members and the activities that they seek to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 81 is reasonable and would make the clause less onerous on trade unions and bring the Bill into line with previous practice that the Government have supported. As it stands, the clause makes it mandatory on trade unions to disclose the details of ballot results to employers, whether or not the employers have shown an interest in receiving such information. It constitutes a departure from the code of practice on industrial action balloting which advised that unions should supply the details to an employer at the employer's request. Our amendment would insert the phrase "If…an employer requests".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain why the Government feel that the clause is necessary, especially as it deals with properly conducted ballots, with all the justified and unjustified safeguards that the Government have already introduced? The clause goes overboard and provides yet another unnecessary safeguard for a properly conducted ballot. I wonder how the clauses were thought of. Was this clause a twinkle in the eye of the Secretary of State, or was it inherited from a previous draft of the Bill, or did a Conservative Member—perhaps the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls)—decide that it was a good clause to add to the Bill? Can the Minister answer that question in his reply?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have there been any discussions with the unions about the clause, or is that a course upon which the Government do not like to embark? Are there any hidden reasons for the introduction of the clause? When debating previous clauses my hon. Friends referred to the Government's possible hidden agenda. On close examination of the clause, it appears that it may well make employers more ready to challenge a result, in defiance of the majority view properly expressed in a ballot. Some of the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden about clause 15 apply also to clause 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses supplied by the Government state that a trade union should
	<br><blockquote><p>"take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that every 'relevant employer'"</p></blockquote>
is supplied with the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information is described as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number of—

	<ol>

	<li>votes cast in the ballot,</li>

	<li>individuals answering 'Yes' to the question, or to each question on the voting paper,</li>

	<li>individuals answering 'No' to the question, or to each question on the voting paper, and</li>

	<li>spoiled voting papers."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I have various worries about the clause. In the light of what my hon. Friends have said, it is clear that a system that would allow employers to identify individuals is undesirable. If a ballot, for example, applied only to a small number of employees in a firm—van drivers, for instance—would the clause require the employer to be told the result of the ballot of members at that place of work, or simply the overall result of the ballot? If the former, and if only a dozen employees were affected, with seven voting one way and five another, would not the employer be able easily to ascertain how individuals voted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>253</span>
and to put pressure on them to change their minds, or even to take action against them? I hope that the Minister understands my argument and that his assurances given a few minutes ago to my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden can be reiterated, perhaps more strongly, in relation to this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause—and particularly the notes on clauses—suggests, on the face of it, that the employer will have to be given very detailed information, which would allow him easily to determine how individuals had voted. The serious consequence would be the complete undermining of the secret ballot, of which the Government claim to be in favour. Surely the Government do not intend to undermine the principle of the secret ballot? The Labour party is, as the Government have always claimed to be, strongly in favour of the secret ballot and the opportunity to vote without intimidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) earlier gave an example of an attempt by an employer to undermine legitimate union activity in the way I have mentioned. We are worried that, unamended, the clause might allow employers undue influence over employees who are trying to exercise their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first note on this clause states that in order for the trade union to be protected against "certain civil law proceedings" it must give employers the details of the ballot result. If the ballot result is against industrial action of any kind, would the employers still be entitled to the information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about how far down the route of compulsion of trade unions the Bill is intended to take us. It refers to employers' entitlement to information, and also to relevant employers. One wonders whether that means employers who are customers or suppliers of the employer in question. Perhaps every Tory Member of Parliament or candidate will soon have to receive that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is unnecessary at best and sinister at worst. We hope that the Minister will respond to the matters that we have raised, especially about secrecy. Under the Bill, the employer will have the right to a tremendous amount of information. That is ironic, in view of the Government's resolute opposition to European directives that allow employees access to information. Freedom of information for employers is a principle that the Government strongly support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to provide even stronger assurances than those that he gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. If not, our grave reservations about the clause will remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asked why we had introduced the proposals. They will build on, and give the force of law to the good practice recommendations set out in the 1990 statutory code in order to protect the interests of union members, employers and the public. The recommendations do not have the force of legislation. As we stated in the 1991 Green Paper, the Government believe that if workers are entitled to vote in a ballot, the employer should have the right to know about the ballot and its outcome. Employers' and employees' associations have supported that proposal overwhelmingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause inserts a new section, 231 A, into the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Section 231A(1) requires trade unions to
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"take such steps as are reasonably necessary"</p></blockquote>
to ensure that the employers of those who are entitled to vote for industrial action are informed about the result of the ballot The matters about which an employer must be informed are set out in section 231 of the 1992 Act. They include the number of votes cast; the number of "yes" and "no" votes, and the number of spoilt papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady did not give me credit for a twinkle in the eye; my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Minister of State and my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge received that credit. She did not associate me with a twinkle, and I am disappointed. It is a great slur on my character. However, I can live with it. The proposals are not a twinkle in the eye of any of my hon. Friends; they were clearly set out in the Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions will be required to give employers the same information as they have to give to their members who take part in the ballot. The outcomes of most ballots are well known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1991 Green Paper explained the Government's intention to change the law to give employers the right to that information. The responses to the Green Paper and further consideration of the issues led us to conclude that it would be appropriate to require trade unions to ensure that employers know about the results of industrial action ballots in all cases, not only when an employer requests information from the union. The onus should be on the trade unions. It is not satisfactory to require trade unions to provide the information only when employers request it. I do not believe that there will be a problem about knowledge of a ballot's result, as the hon. Lady said. The position on votes answering yes to the question, those answering no and spoilt ballot papers will be as set out in the notes on clauses and the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean that the overall results of the ballot will be given? Alternatively, in a firm in which only a few members of staff fall into the category of those balloted, will the employer be given the results solely of those who voted? If so, he would be better able to identify who in the firm had voted one way or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where the existing law requires separate places of work ballots—provided for in section 228 of the 1992 Act—results are required to be notified for each ballot. Otherwise, the overall ballot result is notified. I hope that I have given the hon. Lady the assurance that she seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify the term "relevant employers"? Are we talking about employers whose employees are directly involved in the proposed action and no one else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is as set out in clause 16, which is not the longest clause in the Bill. It provides that in the proposed section 231A(2) of the 1992 Act, "relevant employer"
	<br><blockquote><p>"means a person who it is reasonable for the trade union to believe (at the time when the steps are taken) was at the time of the ballot the employer of any persons entitled to vote."</p></blockquote>
The term is clearly defined in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not reply to some of my questions. Is it not the case, according to the code of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
practice, that the employer can have the information about the result of the ballot if he requests it but that it is not mandatory? Therefore, clause 16 represents a significant change from the previous position described by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The amendment follows a recommendation in the 1990 code of practice on trade union ballots on industrial action, that trade unions should provide information to employers about the results of industrial action ballots, when requested. However, following the responses to the Green Paper and further consideration of the issue, we concluded that it would be more appropriate to require trade unions to ensure that employers are informed about the results of industrial action in all cases, not just when they request that information.

	<p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That confirms that there has been a change. I know that the Government received representations as a result of the debate engendered by the Green Paper.

Can the Minister reassure us that the secrecy aspect of the clause will be considered and that if there is a problem, he will return to the Committee with further proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall consider the points made by the hon. Lady. However, her fears are groundless.

6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to tell how an individual voted. During a general election campaign, we like to believe what people tell us on the doorstep about how they will cast their vote. However, I went to a house where I was told that there were Conservative supporters, only to find Liberal posters in the window.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no need for the hon. Lady to worry in that respect. However, I shall reflect on what she said. I would not want any employer to know how people had voted.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made it clear why he believes that this is an important matter. My Department's statistics indicate that in the 12 months to September 1992, only some 1.7 per cent of days lost to stoppages involved fewer than 25 workers, and only 2.8 per cent of stoppages involved fewer than 50 workers, it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
is reasonable to ask whether amendments such as those tabled by the hon. Gentleman would in practice be likely significantly to undermine the purposes of the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, of course, firmly committed to the principle of independent scrutiny of industrial action ballots. However, I accept that to impose this as a statutory requirement for even the smallest ballot could impose significant extra financial burdens on a union. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Wallasey is not present, as she believes that we are only interested in imposing such burdens on unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the important additional assurance that the universal requirement for fully postal voting will bring to union members, I can see that there is room for questioning whether the further benefits of independent scrutiny of very small ballots might not be outweighed by the additional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accordingly, although we cannot accept any of the amendments in their present form, I am prepared to offer an explicit assurance that the Government are prepared to reconsider the concerns that gave rise to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can go further and tell the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden that the amendments that we envisage are likely to contain the idea of a threshold of 50 members, below which there would be no requirement for industrial action ballots to be scrutinised independently. I can give a further assurance that we shall do our best to table such amendments as Government amendments on Report.

I said that the hon. Member for Wallasey bad missed my concession that will remove much of her worry about financial costs for unions, but she has now returned to the Room.

	<div class='title'>NOTICE OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION FOR EMPLOYERS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 31, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(iii) where it is to be discontinuous but random, the fact that it will be random.".</p></blockquote>
Clause 18 deals with giving employers notice of industrial notice. The cooling-off period will be the subject of amendment No. 83 and in the debate on that amendment we shall explain the main thrust of our argument against the clause. However, amendment No. 68 would give trade unions reasonable freedom of action and prevent unnecessary litigation arising from the clause's interpretation. Some circumstances in which industrial action may be invoked have not been fully foreseen by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
I hope, Mr. Knox, that you will not mind if I refer to another amendment that was not in order and was thus not called, because I wish to show that industrial action cannot be defined as continuous or discontinuous, as the Bill does. The amendment deals with random industrial action, but it is possible for such action to be both continuous and discontinuous at the same time. A trade union may wish to have a one-day strike every Monday. If my interpretation of the Bill is right, that is discontinuous action. It may also want a ban on overtime, or a work to rule, which are continuous actions. A union can at the same time take continuous and discontinuous action, yet that is not allowed for in the Bill. I do not know why, but I see pens being got ready. I am not trying to be awkward. I hope that a trade union would not be excluded from having a one-day strike every week as well as a continuous ban on overtime or a work to rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem would occur when a trade union wished to take random action. If a union wished to go on strike once a week, but on variable days—it would have told the employer—would that be continuous, discontinuous or random? Does a union always have to give the day of the week, or is it sufficient for it to say that every week, on a day not specified, there will be a strike, and that the day will be randomly selected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Minister realises why I ask. The first problem is that the Bill restricts the unions in taking industrial action. Secondly, it will lead to legal questions being raised in the courts. I would be grateful for an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's attempt to clarify the difference between continuous and discontinuous action. It may help the Committee if I explain the concepts by way of example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If action were to be taken on one day, with no further action on other days, that would be treated as an attempt to organise continuous action. If action was taken on two days, but with an intervening period when work could be done normally, that would be treated as an attempt to organise discontinuous action. It would be discontinuous because it would be continued for a day, followed by a period of normal work and then started again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden asked specifically about overtime. A refusal to work overtime would be continuous action if the workers intended to refuse to do any overtime of any kind. It would be discontinuous if the union intended workers to refuse to do overtime only on certain days when the opportunity arose. I hope that I have made it clear, but I shall happily explain it further if anyone is in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, I cannot commend the amendment. Employers and the public should be protected against the damage that can be caused if unions proceed to organise industrial action without prior warning, and as soon as a ballot has been concluded. The concept of pro viding strike notice, albeit in the context of different institutional and legal arrangements, is familiar enough in other countries. That is why new section 234A provides precisely for that notice to be given.

employers. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not. The Minister's comment has just confirmed some of my suspicions. Why should trade unions have to tell employers what sort of industrial action they intend to take? Why must they reveal their game plan? There is a conception that trade unions are wrong and must be disadvantaged, while employers must be given every advantage. I do not understand on what basis the Minister can make that assumption. Why should trade unions have to reveal their game plan? If a trade union told the employer that it was about to take discontinuous action, say, for one day a week, but it did not specify which day that random action would take place, the clause would restrict such action from occurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Restrictions have again been placed on the rights and freedoms of individual members to take industrial action. More draconian powers are being put in place. I understand the meaning of continuous and discontinuous action, but is it not possible for both types of action to take place at the same time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for me to see how action can be both continuous and discontinuous. If it were intended to take action on a specific day, which would be continuous action, but it was proposed also to begin a campaign of disruption, which would involve discontinuous action, the requirements of the clause mean that the trade union would have to give the employer details of what was proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden referred to trade unions having to reveal their game plan. Industrial action is not a game. The point of the clause is to minimise the disruption that is caused to the employer and to other employees. It would be wrong if we were to accept that such action was a game and a part of the process, given that people's livelihoods and the industry's competitiveness could be undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly proper for people to participate in industrial action. But I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is not proper that the employer should be given proper notice of what is planned so that he can make appropriate arrangements to protect the interests of the work force and to meet the interests of his customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the purpose of the clause was to minimise the disruption caused to the employer. Speaking hypothetically, what would be the Minister's view if he considered that certain industrial action was justified—such a position may arise? Why would it then be important to minimise the disruption to the employer instead of defending the rights of the union or the work force to take such action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not count myself as someone who considers that a strike is justified. A disagreement between employers and employees should be resolved without putting the jobs of the employees and the profitability of the company at risk. That is not to say that I do not believe that people should have the right to withdraw their labour. Some EC countries have the ability by law to stop
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
industrial action and use the police to prevent strike action from occurring. In this country, however, we have not thought it right to embrace that sort of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That will be next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) said, but the hon. Member for Gateshead, East said that we introduce employment Bills every two years. We have no plans to introduce the type of measures that are the products of socialist Administrations elsewhere in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northfield missed the point by asking whether action is justified. The clause will not prevent people from taking strike action, it will simply enable the employer to know of the effects of that action on his business and plan accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That rational employer may be pursuing action that justifies going on strike—I know that the Minister will be rather reluctant to concede that. If it is right that the union should disclose its plans to the employer, it is not equally right that the employer should have to disclose his plans for combating the union's efforts to get what it believes is justified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That does not follow at all. The hon. Gentleman has a confrontational view of British industry and the relationship between employers and employees. The notice is notice of the union's intentions. Whether those intentions are justified is not at issue. The union enjoys a privilege—immunity—and we are considering the circumstances in which that privilege should hold. The clause, which the amendment would undermine, will grant that immunity to the trade union only when it has given the employer due notice of its intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, we have now thought of an example of continuous and discontinuous action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the Minister an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I missed it. Will the hon. Gentleman repeat it if I give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The union might be having a one-day strike that is discontinuous—every Monday or Tuesday—and at the same time a ban on overtime, which would be continuous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and if he had already answered his question, I am surprised that he asked me it. I apologise for having missed the example, which would be an example of continuous and discontinuous action. To answer the second part of his question, notice of both forms of action would be required to be given to the employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return to immunity, does the Minister accept that, because of the framework of our law, without some form of immunity, trade unions would probably be illegal, as collective organisations, for being in restraint of trade? Indeed, that was a problem of 19th century trade union law. Immunity allows trade unions to exist. Companies enjoy similar legal privileges—the limited liability provisions that allow companies to exist in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
Why does the Minister treat immunity in tort as if it conferred hugely special privileges, when it only allows trade unions to exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to stray out of order by following the hon. Lady too far down the path along which she invites me. It is certainly true that the law does not regard trade unions as conspiracies to restrain trade, but the immunities and privileges that unions enjoy and that others subject to the law of contract do not are special. The Government have used the framework of those privileges and immunities to make their reforms of the trade union movement, which have been so successful for it and for British industry. Clause 18 will simply provide, in return for the immunity covering action that is not unlawful, that the employer should be given notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the term "in return". Does he view the immunities as a quid pro quo or does he accept that, in a civilised society, they must exist for ever and that they must be in our law? There must be no trade-off of one against the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go some way with the hon. Gentleman in perhaps not entirely endorsing the idea of a trade-off, but if trade unions are to enjoy privileges, the privileges must be subject to constraints. Given that unions are able to organise strike action and enjoy immunities, it is not unreasonable that employers who suffer as a result of such action should at least be informed of what a union plans. The employer should be given reasonable notice so that he can take appropriate action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to "privileges ". We increasingly doubt that they add up to much, given the way in which the laws keep changing. In so far as they are privileges, does not the Minister accept that immunities are necessary because there are no positive rights for unions, including the right to strike, under British law? Would not he be more constructive in introducing a right to strike rather than continually messing around with immunity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But our policy has been geared to discourage disruption, the unnecessary loss of the capacity to create wealth and the loss of jobs and competitiveness in British industry. The changes which we have brought about have resulted in us losing the fewest working days to strikes almost since records began. That has been the success of our legislation. I thought that even the Labour party had broken away from views such as those expressed by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 83m, in page 31, line 45, leave out "seventh" and insert "second".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 70, in page 31, line 45, leave out "seventh".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put it in a nutshell, the amendment relates to the cooling off period—the seven days' notice, statutorily required, that a trade union must give an employer of a strike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government trailed the matter in their Green Paper, giving several reasons for the proposal. One was that it was normal practice in other European countries. However, that is not actually so. If we examine the practice throughout the EC, we shall see that it is not uniform and varies from country to country. In Greece, 24 hours' notice is required in all cases, except for certain defined public services when four days' notice is required. In—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall be grateful if conversations are kept quieter. It seems that although some hon. Members were deprived of their pudding they were not deprived of their drinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Portugal, the figures are 40 hours' notice in all cases of strike and five days in the essential services. In Spain, it is five days in all cases and ten days in public services. In Italy, there is a range of notices depending on the circumstances. In Luxembourg, no notice is required generally, but in a few cases there is a minimum period of notice. There is no uniform practice or procedure within the EC. The examples that I have highlighted all lay down statutory requirements that are less onerous than the requirement that is set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second factor is that everyone has the right to strike; it is a statutory right. During a strike, people cannot be dismissed. In this country, however, the reverse may be true and there may be a breach of contract on a strike notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two cases that the Government try to make—they are based on practice or procedure in the EC—are entirely different. Reasons are given why a seven-day notice is required. One is not unreasonable and relates to health and safety factors that may or may not be involved, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
is that in itself a sufficient basis for a seven-day notice of a strike? We return to what we have argued throughout our proceedings: it is yet another burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that trade unions have privileges and, with them, must go duties. No one denies that. But when duties are imposed on them, they should have concomitant rights. The balance of the Bill is wrong because of the absence of those rights. The Bill creates numerous hurdles, duties and statutory obligations for unions, but they receive no rights in return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time of notification is too long. We have tabled an amendment to delete the seven days' notice and another which would reduce it if it were necessary to fulfil any health and safety requirements. The provisions in the clause are not helpful. They will not improve industrial relations and there is no evidence that they will reduce strikes or other industrial action. For those reasons, we have tabled the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we must agree to differ about whether it is appropriate in principle to give notice of action. I know that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden feels that trade unions should not be forced to reveal their tactics. We have already discussed that point. If one accepts that there should be a notice period, it is difficult to imagine how one could accept the amendments. I have a sneaking suspicion that the hon. Gentleman tabled them because he does not accept the need for notice. One day's notice is hardly worth having; two days' notice, given that it might follow a weekend, is only slightly better. I cannot commend the amendments to the Committee, much as I should like to help the hon. Gentleman, as he will know from the weeks that we have spent in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seven days' notice is the minimum period that would be appropriate. As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, that was the commitment that we made in the Green Paper and in our manifesto, which was so enthusiastically endorsed by the British people in April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to other examples of notice periods in the European Community. He was correct, but a distinction is made in countries, such as Spain and Portugal, between essential and non-essential services. We have not made that distinction in the Bill. In Portugal, the notice periods range from five days for all cases to ten days for essential services. Therefore, seven days seems a reasonable compromise. I do not want to try to define in legislation what is or what is not an essential service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a word of friendly advice to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, I should avoid drawing parallels with European examples if I were him. He knows that I am reasonable and that I do not wish to make life more difficult for him. However, in Germany, industrial action is lawful only if it is organised by a trade union and, even then, not during the currency of a collective agreement. Union rules mean that industrial action is unlawful unless it is supported by a ballot that produces a 75 per cent majority in its favour. In Italy, the state may intervene to require strikers to return to work and the police may be used to force them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such examples can be found in the European Community, but a Government as reasonable as ours does not wish to emulate them. I caution the hon. Gentleman from using our European partners as case
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
studies because officials in the Department of Employment may be persuaded by the arguments used elsewhere and urge Ministers to greater things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly urge Ministers to examine some of the co-determination legislation that exists in Europe. I did not intervene to make that point, but I should like the Minister further to define what he means by "notice". What if industrial action following a ballot is called, notice is given of discontinuous action and negotiations resume during that action? At present, it would be common for action to be suspended pending negotiations. Under the proposed legislation, if industrial action were suspended while negotiations were taking place, would further notice be required? If further notice would not be required, the matter is clarified. If further notice is required, discussions and negotiations would be interrupted and discouraged from taking place during industrial action. That would not contribute to resolving the dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is clear. If action is proposed, notice needs to be given. If the trade union subsequently decides not to proceed with the action, that is a matter for the union. No doubt it would inform the employer in the circumstances envisaged by the hon. Member for Northfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must remember that the requirement to carry out a ballot prior to industrial action will mean that there are 28 days in which the action can be carried out. The Bill provides for seven days' notice. So there are 28 days in which the action can take place once it has been approved by a ballot. If the hon. Gentlemen were to read the Bill he would find that the wording is related to "genuine intent" to carry out industrial action. The sort of problem that he envisages does not occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the action were suspended, would the union have to give further notice if it wished to recommence the action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has me flying without instruments. He needs to distinguish between continuous and discontinuous action. If the action is discontinuous and the union has given notice to the employer that it will be involved in discontinuous action, the answer to his question is no. The hon. Gentleman to focus on the point that the obligation on the trade union is to give notice to an employer where it has a genuine intent to take industrial action. If the union, as a result of further discussions with the employer, decides not to pursue the matter, it will have met those obligations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us, for the sake of argument, say that the action is continuous: a strike commences, it continues for three days and then there is negotiation between the employer and the union. The union suspends the action—it does not get rid of it—while the negotiation takes place. If the negotiation breaks down, does the union have to give a further seven days' notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the action had been suspended, it would not be continuous because it would have stopped. If new action is proposed, the union would be required to give notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case the clause is surely a disincentive to negotiations? Why should a union, having embarked on action, suspend it, thereby minimising inconvenience to the employer—I understood the Minister to want that—if the only result, if negotiations do not produce a settlement, is that the union will not be able to recommence its action without giving notice again? Surely that will get in the way of effective negotiations, which will minimise the chances of solving a dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds as though the hon. Gentleman thinks that the action is the purpose of the dispute. It is not. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's logic. He appears to be arguing that requiring notice for further industrial action would be a disincentive to ending the action and resolving the dispute. I do not understand that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>8.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When attempts are made to resume negotiations during a dispute, it is common practice for managements to ask for a suspension of all industrial action. I suppose that it is seen as a sign of good will. Unions are often anxious for a settlement and are only too happy to suspend their action to get the talks going. If they trigger the seven-day requirement, it would become difficult for them to get back into a dispute if they felt obliged to do so. That legal constraint will discourage them from suspending their action and accepting a company's offer of talks. That is a common occurrence given the present way of doing business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of the Government, industrial action is not now a common occurrence. I do not understand what worries the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East. A union that wishes to suspend industrial action is free to do so. If notice is required of action being taken on certain days, notice could be given at the time of the suspension of action. The union could say to the employer that it was stopping industrial action, but give notice that in seven days it may continue with that action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are returning to the debate on previous amendments about whether it is appropriate for an employer to be given such notice. In the interests of the company and of security of employment, it is not unreasonable that notice should be required. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that the trade unions will not be able to play the game as they did in the past, that is true. There is every justification for that, which is why we are sitting here tonight. The Bill tries to ensure a proper balance between the interests of those who wish to go on strike and those who wish to meet the needs of the economy and the interests of the work force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall develop that point. In the example given by the Minister, a union gives notice, a strike takes place, negotiations take place but fail, and the union is pushed into taking continuous action again. The Minister said that it then has to give seven days' notice. Can that be done under the terms of the ballot authorising the strike, or is a subsequent ballot required?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it relates to the same action, a further ballot is not required. I am amazed that Opposition

Members are puzzled. It was clearly set out in the original Green paper proposals. I am merely the servant delivering the product, which has been well trailed and discussed and has been subject to consultation for a long time. We made the proposals clear.

	<div class='title'>INDUSTRIAL ACTION AFFECTING SUPPLY OF GOODS OR
<br><br><!-- lb --> SERVICES TO AN INDIVIDUAL</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 33, line 15, leave out subsection (3). Clause 19 has not yet featured in the Prime Minister's list of citizens charters. It is a clause that would probably require a vexatious litigants charter or a venal lawyers charter to do it justice. Amendment No. 71 would delete subsection (3) and get rid of the most absurd provision to have appeared in a Bill for many a long year. That may be a bold claim in a decade that has seen the introduction of both the poll tax and the council tax, but it is difficult to see how the Minister can justify subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of argument, let us assume that a person who suffered directly as a result of industrial action might be entitled to some redress. Under subsection (3), however, people could seek redress for a wrong that they had not suffered. People could complain about not being supplied with goods or services even if they had never been entitled to them. Let us take the example of a train. Someone who had never travelled on a train and had no intention of doing so—that is not a description of Lady Thatcher but it is fairly close; she might turn out to be vexatious for many people—might simply go to court in the event of an industrial dispute on the railways. Someone could seek redress from that extraordinary figure, the Commissioner for Protection Against Unlawful Industrial Action—COPUIA. Someone might even go to court because an empty train was late. The clause would permit all that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
Let us take the example of industrial action closing the railways for a day. Mr. or Ms. Vexatious, who had no intention of travelling that day, could go to COPUIA and even seek judicial review if the commissioner did not further the claim against the people who were considered to have conducted unlawful industrial action. That is preposterous. When there is a failure to supply goods or services for a reason not associated with unlawful industrial action, a locus is required to bring the necessary action. This is apparently a non-locus arrangement, made through a specially appointed commissioner at public expense.

There is no merit in the proposition unless, apart from being the vexatious litigants or venal lawyers charter, it is intended also to be the Freedom Association charter or the Jimmy Goldsmith "Do down anybody who is not on the right of British politics" charter. The provision means that an individual—or an outfit—who has not suffered from the industrial action can pursue the matter with the commissioner and, with the commissioner's assistance, take it to court. If our interpretation is correct, that would be an amazing development in English law. Many people would rue the day that it hit the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, I became alarmed. If the clause had the effect that he described, he would have a strong case. I have every sympathy with him because when I read a draft of the Bill I was filled with similar forebodings. His difficulty arises from subsection (3), which the amendment would delete. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining whether an individual may make an application under this section it is immaterial whether or not the individual is entitled to be supplied with the goods or services in question."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman has interpreted "entitled" in the way that a non-legal person would—meaning not entitled, but likely to use the service. The word "entitled" is deliberately chosen because it refers to whether or not there is a contractual relationship between the individual and the body supplying the service. For example, British rail will sell a person a ticket to travel from London to Brighton, but that does not entitle him to travel. There is no contract. If the train does not turn up—I am looking to people who are not in the Room—he would have difficulty arguing that he was entitled to be transported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That distinction is important. Where there was a contractual relationship and where, as a result of unlawful industrial action, that contract had not been met, there would be a right of action anyway. I expected the hon. Gentleman to argue not that the provision was absurd, but that the provision was redundant because a right already existed to allow employers or people subject to contracts to take action if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<p>9 pm</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman's anxiety, which was clear from his opening remarks, was that the vexatious litigant, who has come into view from time to time during the Committee's proceedings, would appear on the scene. I would be extremely worried if the clause was a busy body's charter which would enable people to get involved in sensitive industrial disputes even though such people had no locus, as the hon. Gentleman called it.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>

	<p>If the hon. Gentleman reads the clause again, having heard what I said about subsection (3), he will find that it begins with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an individual claims that—"</p></blockquote>
and continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) an effect, or a likely effect, of the industrial action is or will be to—

	<ol>

	<li>prevent or delay the supply of goods or services, or</li>

	<li>reduce the quality of goods or services supplied,
<br><br><!-- lb --> to the individual making the claim,</li></ol>
he may apply to the…Court".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>There must be a loss arising to the individual in terms of quality or timeous delivery of goods or services.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman might argue that the first line of the clause—"Where an individual claims"—contains a loophole, as the individual may simply claim but could not reasonably expect to receive that service. However, subsection (4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where on the application under this section the court is satisfied that the claim is well-founded, it shall make such order as it considers appropriate".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>Thus, before the clause comes into effect, the individual citizen taking the action must suffer a loss and must persuade the court that his claim that he has suffered a loss is well founded. The opportunity for spurious action of the sort that worries the hon. Gentleman is constrained by the clause, and he rightly draws the Committee's attention to the fact that that should be the case.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just wondering how many locks this door needs. On earlier clauses we were told by the Minister and his colleagues that protections are built in to ensure that trade unions do not take unlawful industrial action, and that that was the purpose of the strike-balloting process. Now, by some magical form of double jeopardy, just in case the employer overlooks something, the person to whom goods are supplied can have another crack at the trade unions. That suggests that the Government are determined to block any reasonable industrial action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about unlawful industrial action. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we should encourage unlawful industrial action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In which case, the hon. Gentleman and I agree. I hope that I can rely on his support in persuading his hon. Friends to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us accept, for the sake of argument, the Minister's response to my point. I have always regarded myself as a master of understatement, not overstatement, but let us assume that I overstated the position. Proposed subsection (3) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is immaterial whether or not the individual is entitled to be supplied with the goods or services in question."</p></blockquote>
Given the British Rail example, that provision means that the person would not be able to take British Rail to court under any circumstances for failure to deliver him to Brighton. Is the Minister saying that if unlawful industrial action prevented the person from being delivered to Brighton, that person will be able to bring a case? We are told that the individual would not be able to take action against British Rail with which he thought he had a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
contract. Some people think that they have a contract with British Rail when they buy a ticket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider circumstances in which British Rail had taken deliberate action so that the train did not turn up. It could have blown up the line or the chairman of British Rail might have thrown himself in front of the train. British Rail would be responsible in those circumstances. Yet the Minister is saying that the individual would be able to make a case not against British Rail but only against the unions for unlawful action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have known that by using the example of British Rail I would be stepping in a minefield. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is more familiar with the ways of British Rail than me because of his close association with the relevant trade union. Furthermore, he has the considerable presence of British Rail in his constituency. Perhaps I oversimplified the position in an effort to make progress. When a person buys a British Rail ticket he has a contract. But that contract contains certain exclusions, one of which may be industrial action, including unlawful industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me what was going on and whether something new is happening. The answer is yes. We are giving a new right to individual citizens who are stranded on station platforms as a result of industrial action. In those circumstances, they can apply to the court for an order that will bring such action to an end. The provision will at least put those people responsible for the problems in contempt of court if the court grants the order and it is not obeyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will not entitle the man stranded on the railway platform to financial compensation but it will provide for the unlawful industrial action to be brought to an end. As the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said, the provision will give a new right to individual citizens that is similar to the right that British Rail, as the employer, already enjoys under earlier pioneering legislation that was introduced by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us stick with the example of British Rail. It could deliberately allow a strike ballot to go through, so that a third party could do its dirty work and bring a dispute to an end. I accept that I have cited a ludicrous example, but the Minister is aware of the sort of vexatious activity that occurs. When imagining the draft arrangements that could emerge as a result of the clause, its potential is horrendous. When disputes arise, common sense does not always follow. I urge the Minister to consider carefully the potential under the clause for damaging well founded industrial relations systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about British Rail allowing a ballot to go through on the basis that a third party will intervene. He has not grasped my earlier point that the clause relates to unlawful action. If a ballot has been organised properly and action is carried out as a result, it does not fall into the category of unlawful action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the duty imposed on the trade union would cover that point. If action occurs outwith the framework of law and without the support of a trade
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
union, the union can hardly be held liable for the wildcat actions of its members. I am sure that the Minister is not claiming otherwise, or is he? If he is saying that the union would be held liable for wildcat action that occurs without its authority, that is one interpretation. The other possibility is that if action has been given the go-ahead by the union, but wrongfully in law, the employer has at his disposal a tool to stop that action. An unfair burden is being imposed on trade unions because employers have the right to stop such industrial action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in a terrible muddle and is confusing official action with what is not, and lawful action with unlawful action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with unlawful action, and it can be either official or unofficial. That depends entirely on the attitude of trade unions, but that is not relevant to a commuter who is stranded on the platform of a railway station and wishes to seek a remedy. Action has taken place which is unlawful and it may be official or unofficial, depending on the attitude of a trade union. The hon. Gentleman was right in this respect: if the action is unlawful, an employer has the means to seek a remedy under measures introduced by the Government, which were no doubt opposed at the time by Opposition Members in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are giving the citizen who suffers a loss as a result of unlawful action the right to go to court to seek an order to bring it to an end. If an employer had already taken that step, that right would clearly be redundant. There may be occasions, however, when an employer does not act and citizens suffer inconvenience. In that event, the provisions in clause 19 would come into effect, and quite right, too. Why should citizens be inconvenienced because a gutless and spineless employer fails to see a remedy for unlawful action which results in loss?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should not a commuter who has suffered as a consequence of unlawful action also have a right to damages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is much more radical than I am. If we were to go down that road, I suspect that Opposition Members would be even more concerned about the clause. In any case, you, Mr. Hogg, would rule me out of order, so I had better not pursue the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to focus on what we wish to achieve, which is the end of unlawful action, not the reimbursement of a commuter. Other aspects of the citizens charter proposals may allow an employer, such as British Rail, to offer redress and compensation to the commuter. But that would be a matter between an individual customer and the company which provided a service, and we should not trespass on it in the context of industrial relations legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify the point with my hon. Friend so that I understand him. Let us assume that I commuted regularly on a train service and a union called a series of strikes—perhaps a one-day strike per week for several weeks—without holding a lawful ballot. Would I be able to go to the courts after the first strike to prevent future actions, should that first action have been unlawful and supported by the unions? Is it the case, however, that I would be unable to do anything to cover myself for the losses that I may have already suffered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend has put his finger on the key point. We must think, however, about what is likely to happen in the circumstances most likely to arise. It would be comparatively unusual for the company concerned not to take action. That is a point that I would have made had I been an Opposition Member. I freely admit that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is right if his case is that it would be unusual for the employer not to take action. Therefore, I am astonished that he is so concerned about the clause. I look forward to him supporting it on the basis that it would be very unusual for it to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the golden thread which I mentioned earlier. While making our step-by-step reforms, we have built on a structure which is related to trade union immunities and the circumstances in which those immunities apply. We discussed that structure during the debate on the previous clause. We are now discussing unlawful action. It is right and proper that citizens should be able to bring unlawful action to a close by taking action in the courts. The issue of compensation would take things considerably further and challenge the basic immunities which are enjoyed. My hon. Friend may wish to pursue that matter with Ministers in other Committees rather than during our debate on the clause. I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, for your indulgence in allowing me to go into the siding to which my hon. Friend diverted me.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should at least have had a card vote on the last amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain our objections to the clause, as drafted, which will show why we tabled the amendments. Clause 19 seems likely to give the ultimate encouragement to the famous, ever-hovering, vexatious litigant. The Government are setting up a commissioner for protection against unlawful industrial action, to help people who will not have the right to go to court themselves. The office is being set up at the taxpayers' expense; it will relate to matters affecting the supply of goods and services but the special arrangements are available only if the supply of those goods and services has been affected by unlawful industrial action. We must ask why there is to be this extraordinary arrangement. The number of such actions that affect the supply of goods and services is minuscule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right that the hon. Gentleman proposes, that costs should be awarded against the applicant whose request is not granted, available to the Equal Opportunities Commission or to any other organisations that help people to bring actions? Does the hon. Gentleman propose that that right should extend to all commissioners who have a similar function?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to make is that they do not have a similar function. There may be hundreds of thousands of cases a year in which legal action is taken over matters affecting the supply of goods and services. The small claims court and the county court would cease to exist were it not for such cases. Certain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
divisions of the High Court also spend a considerable amount of time on those matters. In 99.9999 per cent, recurring, of such cases, people must rely on solicitors, if they can afford them—or on law centres or the citizens advice bureaux, if they cannot—but they cannot use clause 19's special provision affecting the supply of goods and services because it applies only to matters relating to unlawful industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the amendment is accepted, when the commissioner says to the vexatious or just plain daft litigant, "No go, Sunshine. No prime facie case, you're on your own. It's nothing to do with me", that litigant will not have to pay any costs, even though the police, the citizens advice bureau and the local Member of Parliament know him or her to be a timewaster. We believe that there are circumstances in which the complainant may have to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 69, which is being taken together with amendment No. 73, deals with the ability of the commissioner to indemnify the complainant, in effect for all legal expenses in virtually any set of circumstances. I know that the Government are keen on encouraging the idea of contingency fees for lawyers, which can be translated as no win, no pay. However, clause 19 means that win, lose or draw, the taxpayer will pay, although only in the peculiar circumstances described in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complainants will not be able to lose, no matter how silly or preposterous their case may be. Clause 19 is an extension of public support from public funds into an area where there is little evidence of demand. It is being proposed at a time when the Government, through the Lord Chancellor, wants to reduce the availability of existing legal aid to tens of thousands of people. Eight or ten years ago, about 80 per cent of the population were entitled to legal aid. The Lord Chancellor's proposals mean that fewer than 25 per cent of the population will be so entitled, supposedly because public funds will stretch no further. It is wholly and grotesquely inconsistent that the Government are happy to spend public money on the tiny category of potential cases covered by clause 19 but not on legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast to the treatment of a person who may want to pursue a case under clause 19, the cuts in legal aid may mean that no one who is not on income support or its equivalent will be able to get legal aid. That could affect cases involving women seeking advice and assistance for divorce, as legal aid is not available for divorce. Most families in which the breadwinner is injured in an industrial accident will not be able to get legal aid, but their priority for public funds will be lower than that of the possible vexatious litigant described in clause 19. Parents whose children are improperly removed from their care by local authorities, which happens only occasionally, will not be entitled to legal aid. There is not enough money for that. Many criminal defendants, all of whom, according to the principle of English and Scottish law, are innocent until proved guilty, should be eligible for legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider some of the people who will no longer be entitled to legal aid and compare that with the Government's generosity in this scheme. A couple with
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
two children on a gross income of £11,800 do not contribute to legal aid. But because of pressure on Government funds, that couple will be liable to pay £580. A single parent bringing up two children on an income before tax of £8,000 receives legal aid. The Government's proposals will mean that that person will have to find £468 to put towards her case. The Conservatives, in their manifesto, said that they were committed to enabling people with limited means to have access to justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements in the clause would not provide funding just for those with limited means because there is no means test. A millionaire toff on the Brighton line could claim that money, while a single parent divorcing a husband who, perhaps, beat her, could not get legal aid. That is a preposterous set of priorities. Anything to do with undermining or having a go at trade unions is given endless funding, but no money is found for serious matters affecting tens of thousands of our poorest citizens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At earlier sittings, the hon. Gentleman made great play of claiming that the Government's measures were inconsistent. I am worried that the two amendments deal with circumstances that almost parallel those of a complainant of sex discrimination or of race discrimination. Is the hon. Gentleman proposing, first, that there should be no indemnity for a person who complains to a commissioner and, secondly, that if the commissioner does not take up the complaint, that a financial penalty should be imposed on the complainant? If that is the case, the hon. Gentleman would introduce a dangerous principle, which would relate to a range of legislation including that of sex discrimination and race relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not such a principle. To stand here and listen to Conservative Members talking about principles is galling at 9.35 pm when we all want to go home. There is no comparison between our provisions and those relevant to the Equal Opportunities Commission. With the possible exception of some Conservative Members, most people believe that the Equal Opportunities Commission, under its Tory chairmanship, has done and, no doubt, under its next Tory chairmanship, will continue to do a good job. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Tory Ministers do not appoint Labour women to chair such organisations as the Equal Opportunities Commission. Ministers should know the political persuasion of the present chair of the commission—although that was her political persuasion before she became aware of the prevailing situation. If the Conservatives cannot pick the right person, that is their problem, not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is enormous sex discrimination and the Equal Opportunities Commission does not have the resources to pursue all the cases that it should, or to deal with all the complaints that it receives. It needs more resources and anyone who suggests otherwise is plain daft. To suggest a parallel between the Equal Opportunities Commission, with its potential group of complainants who comprise more than half the population, and this pathetic outfit that the Government propose to set up, is preposterous and insulting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just described the position of the new commissioner as pathetic. Would he feel the same if the jobs of the new commissioner for protection against unlawful industrial action and the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members were combined, as suggested by the Institute of Directors? There would be sufficient capacity to take on that additional duty. From calculations that have been done, it would mean that there would be considerable savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were considering proposing that idea on Report, and we may still do that. However, the Bill makes no such proposal. If the hon. Lady thinks that there might be a saving to the taxpayer, because there will not be much of a job to do and it could be done by a body that already exists, I should probably agree with her. The provision, however, aims to establish a pathetic function and a pathetic outfit. The provision must be set against the trade unions' experience of the courts. Those courts have generally been prejudiced against the unions. In any survey of union court cases, it would be easier for me to find that courts are prejudiced against trade unions than for a Conservative Member to find them prejudiced in favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the provision is that the boundary between lawful and unlawful is not always clear. The courts have been resorted to on several occasions about what is and what is not lawful industrial action. If people, perhaps, heaven forfend, acting on legal advice, take action that they hold to be lawful, and at a later stage a court concludes that that action was unlawful, the people will be exposed to the vexatious litigant who is financed by the taxpayer and assisted by the COPUIA commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent example of the bizarre decisions taken by the courts in such matters concerns Middlebrook Mushrooms Ltd, which is involved in an industrial dispute. In the middle of that dispute, on 26 November, the company sent a letter to the trade union's lawyers, which proposed to challenge the action in court. The affadavit from the employers was not available until 11.15 am the next day. The court sat at 2 pm, and at 4 pm an injunction was granted to the employer, restraining the union—get this—from leafleting a shopping precinct where the mushrooms were sold. The court found that there was an arguable case that leafleting in a shopping precinct constituted unlawful industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, someone who was deterred from buying mushrooms by those distributing leaflets could, as I understand it, go to the commissioner and, with his help, go to court on the ground that the unavailability of mushrooms on that day was the result of unlawful industrial action. If that is not crackpot law-making, I do not know what is—that is a bold claim in the decade that has given us poll tax.

I urge my colleagues to support the amendments and, ultimately, to vote against the clause. The clause is unnecessary and will cause much trouble. If taxpayers' assistance is to be given to people with legitimate legal
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
grievances, there are far more deserving cases than the newly invented litigants whom the Government introduce though clause 19.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment on the amendments and request information from the Minister.

It seems that Conservative Members are drawing a parallel between the claims of a frustrated commuter or someone who has been denied access to goods or services because of unlawful industrial action, and sex discrimination or race discrimination. It is almost as if Conservative Members are introducing a new human right—the human right to have goods and services delivered—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is not a human right. It is a service that we all expect to receive but to bloat it to the level of a human right seems to be going too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the Opposition will vote against the clause, on the basis that they do not believe that a commissioner is desirable in the circumstances. That is a difference between our parties, which I understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the amendments, about which I should have thought that the hon. Lady would be concerned, is that, if they are accepted, people who apply to the commissioner in the hope that he will support their rights could find themselves lacking indemnity should proceedings go ahead, or will be subject to a financial penalty if the commissioner says no. That must be undesirable and has much wider applications across the public sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. He made a similar point during the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. He assumes what I was questioning—that there is a direct parallel between not having a good or a service delivered and sex discrimination or race discrimination. Once again, the hon. Member for Elmet has elevated the right to have goods and services delivered to a human right. I do not accept that. That was the point that I was trying to make when the hon. Gentleman intervened. I do not accept that parallel. It does not stand up to scrutiny. The hon. Gentleman begged the question.

It has always been accepted that an individual who takes a complaint to law may face a financial loss if the court's time is wasted. The recent increase in the deposit paid by candidates standing in general elections was to ensure that frivolous or silly candidates did not bring the entire process into disrepute. It is reasonable to deter such vexatious activity. I speak as someone who has the 11 most vexatious litigants living in her constituency, some of whom are known to Baroness Chalker. To ensure that the law is not brought into total disrepute and that the process is not held up to ridicule, we need the safeguards proposed in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have estimates of the cost of setting up the new commission been based on the experience of the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members? It is an ugly name and I do not intend to repeat the acronym, it being so late. Since it was founded, the commissioner has succeeded in spending a great deal of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
public money to almost no effect. In its first year, there were ten applications. So far it has received 137 applications for assistance, according to an analysis of its annual reports. I have more case work in my constituency in one week than the commission seems to have amassed in four years. It has been estimated that the average cost to the taxpayer has been about £250,000 a year. I am not a great mathematician, but I think that that works out at about £60,000 a case. I wish that I was paid that much for looking after my constituents. I would be a rich woman after only six months—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not saying that that is one of my aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister say whether a cost-benefit analysis has been made? Has an estimate been made of the number of cases that the commissioner will have to deal with? It seems to be an extremely cushy job. What salary is the commissioner paid for doing that onerous job?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said, people who are in more difficult circumstances are being denied legal aid. Although state aid is being withdrawn for ballots and trade union education, it is being sprayed almost with impunity in other directions, encouraging people who do not need to pass a means test to use the law to harass trade unions and bring them into disrepute. I support both amendments and look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me respond quickly to the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras made continuing references to the poll tax. I confess that I wrote a pamphlet for the Conservative party entitled "The Case for the Poll Tax". I understand that it is now out of print.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey asked about the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union members. That will be a part-time post and the rate of pay will be £250 a day. The hon. Lady should realise that it is part of her job to prevent cases coming before the courts and she should not judge her output in those terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras mentioned legal aid and the proportion of people entitled to it as a result of changes in Government policy. He should have focused on the huge increase in the legal aid bill which has occurred under this Government. I do not expect many cases to be brought as a result of the provisions in the clause. Labour Members are in a better position to influence that than I am because the Government clearly wish to avoid unlawful industrial action that is not brought to a speedy end by an employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) asked whether we could combine the functions of the commissioner for protection against unlawful industrial action with those of the Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members. I am happy to tell the Committee that that is precisely our intention. My hon. Friend will find the costs set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras to withdraw the amendments. Amendment No. 73 would put a penalty on people who went to the commissioner for protection against unlawful industrial action for help, and that would be unreasonable. There could be legitimate reasons for the commissioner to refuse
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
assistance, other than the fact that the case was frivolous. For example, more than one person may wish to take action and it would be clearly a waste of public funds and effort to pursue several independent actions. It would be harsh if the person whose action was not pursued found himself with a bill for having raised the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree to accept amendment No. 69. The Bill provides for the commissioner to give help and an indemnity when damages are sought, following an interdict in Scotland or the equivalent interlocutory order in England, in which a claim for damages was made after the interlocutory procedures has been completed and it was found that the case was not successful. New section 235C(1) will clarify that the commissioner may give such an indemnify. Although the amendment would not necessarily remove the commissioner's liability to indemnify in respect of damages specified in the section, it is important that it should be beyond doubt that the commissioner will have those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras questioned whether it was right that a millionaire on the London to Brighton line should be helped in that way. Would he have the same attitude towards a millionairess feminist active in public affairs who sought to take an action to the Equal Opportunities Commission or to the Commission for Racial Equality when, again, no means test would apply? The hon. Member for Wallasey said that the two cases are not the same, but, to me, they are exactly the same. Why is it all right for a millionairess to pursue a feminist cause at the taxpayers' expense but wrong for a millionaire to pursue the cause of the ordinary interests of his fellow citizens? That is hypocritical. The clause will not be used as often as the provisions that the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
