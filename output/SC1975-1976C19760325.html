	<i>Further amendment proposed to the new clause [23rd March],</i> in line 36, at the end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which will in all cases, sit with two assessors".—[
	<i>Mr. Jopling.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I continue from where I got to on Tuesday morning on the amendment I moved with regard to the possibility of its being mandatory that assessors should join the chairman and two additional members of the Agricultural Land Tribunal in all cases. Reading the remarks the Parliamentary Secretary made I notice he said right at the end:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are in favour of encouraging them to use assessors where they think it is necessary, but we do not wish to make it mandatory …" —[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 23rd March; c. 939.]</p></blockquote>
The position we have had in the past, which I talked about at some length the last time we met, was given in an answer which the Parliamentary Secretary gave me to a Question on 8th March when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I understand no chairman of an agricultural land tribunal has found it necessary to appoint assessors in the last five years".[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 21.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, over many years, apparently, no assessors have been used and from the figures in the answer which the Parliamentary Secretary gave me the Agricultural Land Tribunals have not been used very much. In fact, over the last five years they have met on average throughout the whole of the country, excluding Scotland, less than 50 times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
I submit this is one of the reasons why professional advisers to people in agricultural disputes are loath to take those disputes to Agricultural Land Tribunals in certain circumstances. What we need to do is to try to find something which gives professional advisers in agriculture field more confidence in the tribunals so that they can take cases to them. The Minister said that he is in favour of encouraging the tribunals to use assessors. I think it would be a good thing, and it would give more confidence right throughout the agricultural industry if we were to make this amendment and make it mandatory that in all cases assessors should be added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether any of my hon. Friends wish to add to these remarks, but I do feel very strongly about this matter and I hope the Minister will reconsider his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether the Minister could elaborate a little on what he said at the last sitting:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are in favour of encouraging them to use assessors where they think it necessary but we do not wish to make it mandatory …"ߞ [OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Standing Committee C,</i> 23rd March; c. 939.]</p></blockquote>
Will it be that assessors will normally sit and that only in abnormal cases they will not? I hope the Minster will elaborate on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jerry Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not appreciate that we were likely to have a debate on the virtue of land tribunals at this point, but it was inevitable that it would come at some time during the proceedings of the Committee. Since speaking at the last meeting of the Committee I have had some communications with the Agricultural Law Association. If the Chair does not rule me out of order I would like to refer hon. Gentlemen to new Clause 13(3) by which it will be possible, after the Agricultural Land Tribunal has decided a matter, to refer the terms of the tenancy to arbitration. Is it being suggested, or it will be suggested when we come to it, that in order to save expense and problems there might be a case for this matter being decided by arbitration and not by the Agricultural Land Tribunal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have not yet reached new Clause 13. What we are discussing is whether we shall have two assessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enjoy an argument with you Mr. Costain, but clearly these new clauses are all linked. We were told originally that we would get one new clause and that the object of all these new clauses is one single matter—at least, the principle of one single matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will accept that I have tried to be constructive in my remarks. In my speech I asked the Minister if he would take the advice of the 30 or so lawyers who have the task of actually carrying out this law in practice. I know he probably has not had the opportunity to do so simply because of the time factor involved. I would not press him to be more definitive about his answer this morning, but rather ask him if he would consult with them in the interests of the fairest possible adjudication in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree there will be a problem, particularly where one of two sons of about equal merit have to be chosen by the Agricultural Land Tribunal. There will be many difficult matters the tribunal will have to decide and they will be new to the experience of the Agricultural Land Tribunal. If we could get the right form for deciding these differences of opinion, then some of the major differences which will occur in the countryside through the process of carrying out this legislation would be removed. I would appeal to the Minister to be as sympathetic as he possibly can to the general point I am making in the hope that the system will be seen to be not only fair but efficient and cheap as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to respond very quickly to hon. Members by saying we will indeed consult all these interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said repeatedly, we will be bringing out new regulations under a new statutory instrument to give guidance to the Agricultural Land Tribunals on these matters. I said we will encourage the chairmen to appoint assessors. I can go a little further and tell the Committee that in consultation with the Lord Chancellor's Office, which is responsible for the ALTs, we shall draw the attention of tribunal chairmen to the desirability of appointing assessors in these cases. We will in fact write to the chairman of each tribunal
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
bringing this matter to their notice. I am absolutely sure the points made by hon. Members will not have escaped their attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think hon. Members have argued that it would be a mistake to take this matter away from the purview of the ALTs. They have also agreed, certainly the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), that it would be a mistake to make it absolutely mandatory that in every single situation they would have to have two assessors regardless of the nature of the case. I hope that in view of the assurance I have given the hon. Member will see fit to withdraw this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to prolong this debate unduly but just briefly to describe a certain amount of disturbance in my own mind. I have tried to gather information on the ALTs and it is all very itsy-bitsy. Can the Minister, by nodding his assent, indicate that when he publishes the new regulations to which he has referred some effort will be made to pull the whole thing together in some preamble to put the Agricultural Land Tribunals in proper perspective? The present arrangements are in some respects contradictory, in others ambiguous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will write to the hon. Member if that would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for what he has said. I had it firmly in my mind when we began this debate that we really had to go for the appointment of two assessors being mandatory. I have listened to all of the points which have been made during the debate, and the assurance which the Parliamentary Secretary has given, that he is prepared to write to all the chairmen of the various tribunals and encourage them positively to appoint more assessors, I think probably goes most of the way, and it is, perhaps, something we could agree to. I am glad to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) is agreeing with me, because his experience in these matters is of great help to the Committee. In view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, and because it will, perhaps, be possible to return to this on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment to new clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>945</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn E. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move as an amendment, to the new clause, Amendment (
	<i>a</i>), in line 39, leave out "in agriculture".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we can discuss</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>

	<p>Amendment (
	<i>n</i>), in line 40, after "education", insert "and achieving the relevant qualification";</p>

	<p>Amendment (
	<i>b</i>), in line 42, leave out "three" and insert "four";</p>

	<p>Amendment (
	<i>o</i>), in line 43, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that where three academic years formed part of the seven years mentioned in that paragraph, at least three years were spent engaged in agricultural work on the holding, within the meaning of section 94(1) of the 1948 Act, not including time spent during the three academic years".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We gave due warning at Second Reading that we would attempt to modify or amend this clause in this fashion. I would like, before we come to the specific amendment, to look at the phrase in subsection 3(
	<i>b</i>) of the new Clause, where we talk about
	<br><blockquote><p>"his only or principal source of livelihood".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have already discussed that. We cannot go back to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to dwell on it, only to refer to it. I think this should be defined clearly to say where we are with students. If a parent were to say that a student is already pursuing a course at a college that would imply that the person had only lived on the farm; it would not have been his livelihood. He would have been supported by his parents because he would have been at school. Would "his only source of livelihood" cover him in that case? It is a small point, but surely he can only be a schoolboy in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is quite ludicrous for us to confine this qualification to a course in agriculture. It is totally unnecessary to have this section of the community having to take a course in this narrow field simply to return to the farm to work it. This will only add to our difficulties. It would be much wiser to leave the whole thing wide open, and if people wish to pursue a course of higher or further education, surely that would be right and proper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading it is vital that we protect the lifeblood of small rural communities by ensuring that people
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
such as these can return and live in those communities. We have example after example of people who have received quite advanced education who wish to spend their lives working and living in the small rural parts rather than necessarily pursuing their studies. I have always believed that as many people as possible should have further and higher education. It should be education and not training, and not simply for a career. It should be for its own sake. In which case we would be operating against that kind of idea if we say that these young people's education should be confined to agriculture. They need not be young people; there could be others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that is important is that many university courses today have been extended from three to four years. That is why I have sought this amendment, so that we could, as we ought, cover such cases, so that if, just by a fluke, a person decides on a diploma course he should not be debarred. He would be debarred, unless we were to provide this safeguard. I want to be brief because, to me, the whole case is self-evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little concerned that Amendment (
	<i>n</i>)talks about "achieving the relevant qualification". I see no reason why people in this category should have to get the qualifications at the end of the day. Are the hon. Members who put down this amendment saying that these people must get the qualification in agriculture before they can go back to the farm? This is totally unnecessary, and I would reject that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be directing my remarks mainly to the amendments which stand in the name of my hon. Friends and myself and 
	<i>en passant</i> I shall be referring to some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick). These are extremely important amendments. I would describe them as very fundamental and basic to the future of agriculture in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would mention what the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs said in a paper which, no doubt, it sent to all members of the Committee. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We endorse the requirements of a five-year period of work on the farm in question with the allowance for agricultural education"</p></blockquote>
and "agriculture" is in capitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>947</span>
The hon. Member indicated that he was speaking for the young people or many of the young people who were going into agriculture. The Federation of Young Farmers specifically speaks for those going into agriculture, and their views on this subject are absolutely clear. They believe that if these clauses are to become law then it is vital that there is a requirement for a five-year period of work on the farm in question, with the allowance not just for general education but agricultural education particularly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would refer the hon. Member to the interesting report of the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Education 1966, which sat under the Chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington, Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Education for Industry and Commerce. I spent a considerable time reading through this report. Virtually everything the hon. Member said is confounded; or, to put it more pertinently, this report takes a different point of view, believing that agricultural education is vital for those who are to farm in this country. I would quote the first sentence. I am sorry the hon. Member has had to go. I wanted him to hear this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is also on another Committee and apologises that he has had to go there. There is such a thing as a quorum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This seems to be an extraordinary situation. The hon. Member, after moving an amendment, to which I am endeavouring to put the other side, has moved on to another Committee. It is an extraordinary way for the Committee to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first sentence of this excellent report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The technological revolution which British agriculture has undergone during the past 25 years has drawn on the resources of physics, chemistry, the biological sciences and engineering."</p></blockquote>
Section 5 of the introduction says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The needs now are to secure a progressive system of agricultural courses accompanied by practical (industrial) training, and to complete the integration of agricultural education with the rest of further education thereby ending the present dichotomy."</p></blockquote>
That is a very interesting and realistic way of putting it. From my interpretation of what the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor said in introducing
	<span class='label label-info column'>948</span>
his amendment, the report takes a totally different point of view from what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely difficult to differentiate and to draw a demarcation line between education and training, but the administrators of both agricultural education and education in general have to do precisely this. Training, by definition, and here, no doubt, I am in agreement with the hon. Member, is narrow. It is specific to a job. It is to enable a person to be able to do a job better, whether that job be ploughing, agricultural engineering, dairying, farming estate management, horticulture, forestry, poultry husbandry or whatever. Education, however—and I am delighted to see that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor has returned—is by definition, of necessity, much broader. Far be it from me to say that education and training do not go together and that education is not a vital part of the broad intake into agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the hon. Member is leaving again. I am tempted, Mr. Costain, to ask for an Adjournment of this Committee to enable the hon. Member to listen to the excellent case being put to the other side of the Committee. Perhaps you would indicate by a nod or a wink whet her that would be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I would prefer not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I accede to your sedentary request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it may sound pompous, and I am seldom if ever that, education must be to do with the quality of living. Perhaps this is part of the argument presented by the hon. Member. The quality of living of a person receiving education, and, if he is well educated, his ability to impart that quality to others as well, is a very important element in education in the widest sense of the word. Education, above all in the context of agriculture, has to do with the training of the mind. Here we return to the word "training".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agricultural education in this country could be split into four quite separate parts. First of all there is a degree education at an university; then there are diplomas; then there are certificate courses; and, lastly, there are part-time courses. In a neat and ordered world a man could take a degree eventually leading him to become a research worker,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>949</span>
adviser or teacher, and anyone taking a higher national diploma would become a technologist. Anyone taking the Ordinary would be a technician and anyone taking a certificate would become a craftsman. No doubt the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) will talk about craftsmen in agriculture because she has represented many of these over a number of years. Anyone taking a part-time course, depending on the level, will either become an operative, skilled man or craftsman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is not a very neat and ordered world in which we live. One of the important things for those in education, certainly those in agricultural education, to remember is that education does not give anyone the right to a better job, but merely the opportunity to gain that better job if he or she is good enough to grab it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saying that, I have expressed the sentiments of F. A. W. Peregrine, Principal of the Lancashire Institute of Agriculture, at a seminar held at the end of last year at the Farmers' Club on the agricultural education system. It is important to know that the agricultural industry takes education seriously, and regularly meets the experts within the industry to discuss this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not take one person's point of view. Let us move on to Mr. Huckle of the Agricultural Training Board. No doubt here the Minister's ears will prick up, because the Government, quite rightly, are very much in favour of training and played a big part in the formation of training boards. Mr. Huckle at this same seminar said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is happening is that the training board is able to provide the facilities that are required and if there is a need for definition between education and training, and I do not see that there is, it is that education is learning how to learn and training is learning how to put into practice what has been learnt. These should always be going together."</p></blockquote>
Here is a clear statement from somebody who knows a great deal about the job and the industry—that both education and training are a vital part of agriculture and vital to these young people who are going into the agricultural industry. This point of view totally confounds the views expressed by the hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not stop there, I will quote Mr. Kenney of the Harper Adams Agricultural College, Shropshire. He says:
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The training which comes through the Board "—</p></blockquote>
he is referring to the Agricultural Training Board—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the training we give, and the sandwich training in particular, is giving these people the opportunity to keep track of what is happening. It is a most encouraging situation in this country".</p></blockquote>
And here he is commenting on the fact that general education and agricultural education, following the recommendation of the Pilkington Committee, now go hand in hand and are not separate as they were some years ago—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a most encouraging situation in this country. One of the fears was whether we would get sufficient good training farmers. There is great co-operation taking place on education with the industry, and the links have never been better."</p></blockquote>
This is his comment upon the situation as he saw it in October last year, and I do not think that hon. Members opposite could say that the situation has changed since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to express the views of as many people as possible from within the industry, and I would now quote very briefly from another gentleman who works for the Agricultural Training Board, Mr. R. Swan. Speaking at that same seminar he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the Industrial Training Act enabled the industries to establish their own Training Boards, so that the industry could have training to meet the requirements of an individual employer, that seemed to me to be an opportunity of meeting these criticisms."</p></blockquote>
Of course, the criticisms that had been levelled in the past were about the inadequacy of training and the lack of cooperation between industry and training establishments. So, again, we have a very positive view being expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the distinction between education and training, I shall give just one short analogy. If you go to the dentist—perhaps, Mr. Costain, you do not need to go; you may not have your own teeth—ask him before you sit in his chair whether he is educated or trained. If he says that he is trained but not educated, I suggest that you walk out. If he says that he is educated but not trained, then you should run out. But if he is both, you indeed then have a chance of good treatment. In short, I am talking about a very specialised area of dental surgery, and this could take us through into veterinary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
surgery and medicine, where the education system has a responsibility to supply both education and training within the same establishment. They must be able to go out and make an impact at once, and I believe that it takes a considerable period for them to do this. I say that it takes six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, education in a college is not sufficient in the case of agriculture. There must be education in agriculture as well, and part of that should be spent working practically on the land. That is the industrial training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have consulted a considerable number of people on this subject, because, as I said, these amendments are very important and very fundamental. From the impassive way in which the Minister has been listening to my remarks, I can only assume that he has agreed with the case which I have put forward. Certainly, my case is well supported by members of the Agricultural Training Board, and fully supported and documented by this very excellent report which was published by the Committee sitting under Sir Harry Pilkington, and which emphasised the importance of agricultural training for those coming into agriculture. A part of that agricultural training—I would emphasise this to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—is that part of the education which is spent on the land getting practical experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the reply of the Minister to the case made by his hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor about the young man nearing the end of a college course when his father dies. In those circumstances, all the facts of the case would have to be considered by the Agricultural Land Tribunal, because it could be that the young man did not have sufficient agricultural training to enable him to take over the tenancy from his late father. I have consulted people—but I am not expressing an official point of view—at the Royal Agricultural Society, and they are all very strongly of the opinion that, where these clauses are concerned, the course and training must be in agriculture. I shall go a little further to try to meet some of the objections of the hon. Member for Brecon
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>
and Radnor, and say that they must be in agriculture and related subjects. There are many who feel that only full-time courses should qualify and that day-release courses would not be adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate in his reply exactly what "agricultural education" means. How is it to he defined? Does it include horticulture, forestry and farm and estate management? All should be adequate to fulfil the definition of an "eligible person". One could give details of the very excellent and balanced courses offered at the Cirencester College. Here we have a very fine institution which, over many years, has turned out excellent young farmers who are now taking maximum advantage of the land in order to produce food for this country. May I ask the Minister to define "agricultural education" and "agricultural training " in relation to these clauses, so that we can all be clear in our minds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
University courses in agriculture and related subjects are extremely competitive in this country, and I would make the point, which I hope will be borne in mind by the ALT, that even if a young man does not at university achieve a degree in agriculture he should still be considered, because the quality of these courses is very high indeed, and even a failure could clearly indicate that a person would still be competent in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is running out, and I am tempted to talk about the ONC, the HNC, the OND and the HND, but no doubt the Minister will make some comment about agricultural qualifications. I hope that I have dealt with all the arguments that might be raised on these four amendments, but I remind the Committee that the two amendments in which I am interested are Amendment (
	<i>a</i>), to line 40 after "education" to insert "and achieving the relevant qualification", and I have probably said sufficient on that score.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->

I hope that even the hon.

I also hope that I shall have the support of the hon. Lady the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard), because I know that she represents craftsmen and operatives who are working practically on the land. With those few words, I comend the case that I have put to the Committe and look forward to the Parliamentry Secretary's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When we are told by an hon. Member opposite that he inherited a farm at, for example, Weston-super-Mare at the age of 21 I wonder whether he had the necessary six years of training and education. I should like to know whether all the hon. Members, who have had to declare their interest as owner-occupier farmers, as tenant farmers or as landlords, had the necessary education in agriculture, because the consequence of the argument of the hon. Member opposite is that there should be no farmer left with his farm in England or Wales—tenant farmer or owner-occupier—unless he had both training and education, with degrees, certificates and diplomas for agriculture. Does he really mean that? We know that the majority of Members of the Tory Party, whether or not they declare their interest in farming, have taken a degree in a subject other than farming. That is why I say that the argument was rubbish, and the hon. Member knows that it was rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have these great qualifications in different subjects from Oxford or Cambridge, and they still find themselves with this God-given gift of a farm, because they inherited it at the age of 21. But why, when the qualification does not apply to them, must it apply here? The answer is obvious. They still wish to restrict the opportunities of the relations of tenant farmers to inherit. They are still playing their old game and saying " We are afraid to deny the principle, because the NFU will not like it. We are afraid to deny the principle, because the tenant farmers in our constituency will not like it." Therefore they seek every possible method to narrow it down, even to the extent of making upon these people demands which they do not apply to themselves. I do not do that. Few people would do that. But they do it, and I do not like it.

But it is nonsense to claim that the only people who are farming are those who have taken a narrow degree.

As an expert in Scottish music and Scottish literature, overnight I became a Minister of Agriculture. Of course my hon. Friends and I want to extend the education of the agricultural tenant. If

the amendment included all sons of landlords and owner-occupiers that would be fine, but it includes only a particular group of successors, and that is nonsense. It is part of the old Tory programme of trying to spin things out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should certainly prefer any farmer to have qualifications, training and education in agriculture. The words in the clause are far too narrow. The most distinguished agriculturalist in the Committee, and the most highly qualified, is my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary. I am told that he is a Doctor of Philosophy. We are not talking about Plato and Socrates—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->

The clause is drawn too tightly. The best man we have in agriculture would not qualify. I am not arguing 
	<i>ad hominem</i> for the sake of my hon. Friend but for the dozens of others who would be excluded by this provision. The case has been made out that the words "in agriculture" must go and we must define education less narrowly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to speak for a moment on Amendment (
	<i>n</i>). I have in mind the case of a boy who is studying in agriculture when his father dies. Will he be debarred
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>957</span>
from taking over the farm because he has not completed his course? For that reason alone, we cannot accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Amendment (
	<i>b</i>), we were told by Opposition Members of the need for longer training. That has happened. Courses are extended and many colleges now have four-year courses. Once we accept the principle—and it is in line with the Opposition's argument—"three" must be replaced by "four". I ask my hon. Friends strenuously to resist Opposition amendments and to accept the amendments put down by my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only training I had was a pupilage in dairy farming, and that put me off farming so much that I became a barrister. Having made enough money at the Bar I was able to go in for pig farming where I found similarities between my professional clients and the animals I was looking after. The most useful members of the Bar and the most successful practitioners are not those who come hot from university with a first-class law degree but those who come from another discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Renfrew-shire, West (Mr. Buchan) is that the previous Labour Government sold the pass. Section 44 of the Agriculture Act 1970 sets out the kind of experience that is needed to qualify for a statutory smallholding. If the amendments are accepted, we shall have even more anomalies and nonsenses because the qualifications for taking over a holding from a father will be less than those necessary for taking over a statutory smallholding. For a small enterprise of a few acres the qualifications and experience will have to be greater than are required for taking over the tenancy of a farm of 1,000 acres. That is sheer nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West was responsible for it, but in 1970 the previous Labour Government brought into being the Smallholdings (Selection of Tenants) Regulations 1970, which came into effect on 1st August of that year. Under those regulations an applicant for a statutory smallholding must show that for a period of no less than five years he has been occu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>958</span>
pied in full-time farming. A three years' attendance at a full-time course in agriculture at a university, college or establishment of further education counts towards the five years. The pass was sold in 1970 when there had to be training or education in agriculture, specifically excluding education in any other subject. Now that those regulations are in existence, we are bound to disagree with the proposals of the minority group opposite, unless they would be willing to press the Government to change the 1970 Regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are not opposed to agricultural training or to practical experience, both of which are essential. But let us not restrict education and training to agriculture. It is a question of defining what we mean by "education". I define "education" as the opportunity for a person to develop his potential to the full, not passing examinations or getting a better job.

The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said that education has always been taken seriously in farming. I am not sure that that is correct. I was a member of the little NEDC for Agriculture which inquired into educational standards in the farming industry. We found, as may be seen from the report, that the educational standards in the agricultural industry were really quite low in relation to farmers and farm workers and there has been a tendency in our society to believe that someone who did not get a good education could always go into farming. This is a bad attitude to take towards our industry, and not a very sound one in a logical sense because, today in particular, we need in our industry, which is highly mechanised and technical, people who are very well educated. I remember attending a farmers' conference at which the chairman was a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>959</span>
member of a big farming company. Perhaps he reflected the attitude towards industry of four or five years ago. He said he did not mind farm workers being trained but he really did not want them to be educated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That attitude is bad for farm workers and industry and I hope the Government will accept the argument we are putting and will not restrict education in this sense just to agriculture. Let us broaden it. That will be good for the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found myself in agreement with much that the hon. Lady said about the need for education in agriculture, but I think the attitude to which she referred, of saying if someone is no good at anything else he should be put into agriculture, went by the board long ago. It was nonsense years ago, in the 1930s, because even then the agricultural worker had immeasurable knowledge which had grown up by custom, through living on the farm and in the village; knowledge of where watercourses were, or where drains had been put in by his father or his grandfather. He was a skilled man, though not a specialist as so many are, and have to be today. He was a skilled man with many skills. The herdsman was probably one of the most highly skilled, as was the shepherd, always a lonely man and rather resented because he always wanted the best fields for his flock on his share of the farm.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe it is a good thing to leave out the words "in agriculture" because I believe that if I boy or girl is bent on taking over the father's farm he or she would have wanted to go in for an agricultural education. This is a point which must be considered in these circumstances, in relation to someone wanting to be considered for a holding. He would not have gone to take a course in law, political philosophy or other such things as one can take today. Personally. I have no such qualifications whatsoever. I would have loved to have had an opportunity, such as so many people have today, of going to university and studying other things though I do not believe I would have got

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision in the clause is something we have to hang on to, and that is why I disagree with the hon. Member who wishes to leave out the words "in agriculture" because I believe that a son wanting to learn as much as possible at about the age of 18, in the time he spent in further education, taking it in the wider sense, would have taken a course in agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with what has been said on the other side of the Committee this morning. With regard to the observations of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) in attacking Tory Members and the Tory Party, there are such individuals as the noble Lord, Lord Ryder, who as a financial journalist is an expert in that and has evidenced other virtues and capacities; and there is also Sir Richard Marsh, similarly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point which the hon. Gentleman is missing and which I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take up is that this educational provision is a default qualification which would exclude an inheritor who has not worked on the holding by reason of having pursued education, and that brings us automatically to an age group. That raises the question of what will happen to a son if the death occurs when he is just on the point of completing his course, a point with which we have not come to grips. But by definition almost certainly it would apply only in the lower age structure, as I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would confirm. It follows, therefore, that one should be looking for evidence of intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having failed to work on the farm, what is the next best thing? Surely, it would be to take a full-time course in agriculture, and agriculture can be very widely defined. If we were to put down an amendment on that, Mr. Costain, I believe you would have enormous difficulty in restricting it. It covers an enormous field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would challenge hon. Members opposite on this question of obtaining education in agriculture, and I do so in relation to the facilities made available by county councils for further education in agriculture. They are unrestricted, and there is no particular difficulty over
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
admission. Were one to consider the situation critically one would put at the top of the list the low academic content required of a candidate to gain admission to those establishments. I am not saying they are not looking for practical people, but the requirements in terms of numbers of CSE and 0 levels is often lamentably small in this context, so that access is perhaps all too easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision being a default qualification it follows that it should be reasonably related to the object of working on the land, which brings us to the purpose of the course, which, therefore, should be agriculture. It would follow also that by definition the full-time course would apply almost exclusively to the young person. I can see no justification for Amendments (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendment (
	<i>n</i>) seeking to insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and achieving the relevant qualification"</p></blockquote>
I see some merit in that. Perhaps it is mandatory. We would like to know the views of the Parliamentary Secretary on this. There is a snag in the amendment in that in the event of death it might not be possible for the educational course to be completed. The death might frustrate completion of the course for natural and proper reasons. Although there is difficulty over the exact wording of this amendment it has virtue.

Friend said, and the research he had quite clearly done, are of immense value to the Committee in considering just what our attitude should be to agricultural education. I feel this has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>963</span>
been a debate of extreme value. We have heard from the other side a number of remarks which I shall come to in a few moments, and which display extraordinary ignorance about the qualifications, both practical and academic, required by someone who is to be an efficient farmer in the modern context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West has a habit of getting up and making the same speech on every occasion. I would nut accuse him of doing it in the same way as some of his anti Common Market friends do—and I am not thinking of my hon. Friends: I was thinking of some of those Labour Members who sit below the Gangway. Indeed the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West rather reminds me of Bing Crosby, who used to be called Old Groaner. In this matter the hon. Gentleman becomes the old gramophone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to lay at rest one remark he made when he argued that many of us might not have qualified when we started farming. As far as I am concerned, I believe I have qualified sufficiently, having spent three years at university doing a degree in agriculture. I suppose, taken to its logical conclusion, he is saying that every MP should have a degree in politics. It seems to me to be rather a strange argument. Of course it is possible, and it is very often the case, that somebody with one academic qualification or training embarks on work in a totally different field. One has heard of farmers who have successfully taken degrees in anthropology, history, philosophy and all sorts of other disciplines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these proposals we are talking about something quite different. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) put his finger on the button here, and this has been repeated constantly by the Parliamentary Secretary when he told us of cases where there was serious hardship where the young man was hell bent on becoming a farmer. I think my hon. Friend was right when he said that it would be natural to expect that the sort of people that this clause should aim at covering would want to embark on an academic course on agricultural training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would think, listening to some hon. Members opposite talking about agricultural training, that it was highly technical,
	<span class='label label-info column'>964</span>
but in the educational sense this is totally untrue. What I think has not been accepted is the fact that a degree in agriculture does cover a very broad area of human experience and knowledge. It covers a number of things besides the pure science studies such as botany, sociology, and veterinary science. Certainly my own course covered such things as building design, economics, and a certain amount of law. No one can say that at the end of most agricultural courses at farm institutions and university the students are merely trained and not educated. This is a delusion we have been suffering from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I would like to do is to comment on the amendments one by one. Taking Amendment (
	<i>a</i>) to begin with and the remarks of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick), I think I have dealt with this. Here we are considering cases of hardship, and we are thinking about those young men who are, to use a phrase, hell bent on going into agriculture. If they wish to go off and spend three years at university reading philosophy or anthropology or something quite different from agriculture I do not think we can then say that these are the ones who will suffer from hardship. When we are dealing with those people who are suffering from this hardship it would be reasonable to suppost that they went to university or had an academic training with the intention of going into farming. I think it is quite right that the Government have put in the words "in agriculture" and I hope very much that they will not be withdrawn. I think that that would be totally wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment (
	<i>n</i>), my hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton) thought it a little too mandatory. I can quite well see the hardship which might arise where a young man was on the point of taking his final examinations and then his father died. At the same time, we ought to approach this problem by trying to help a young man who is wanting to get into farming. It is not unreasonable to expect that he should qualify. I think the Committee will agree that this amendment goes some way in suggesting what the Committee's attitude should be to these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to Amendment (
	<i>b</i>). What
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>965</span>
the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor is wanting to do is to open the way for a young man who wants to embark on a course at university or other institution which involves a four-year course rather than a three-year course. The hon. Gentleman is a school-teacher and he may know more about this than I do, but I think that when I was at university virtually all the courses in agriculture were for three years. The hon. Gentleman did not give us practical examples of what he had in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general it is true to say that most postgraduate courses in agriculture, in my experience, are devoted to research of one sort or another. While it is important that a practical farmer should have some knowledge of research, I would have thought that in general it is unnecessary in terms of practical farming to embark on a course of more than three years. I remember that I considered quite seri-
	<span class='label label-info column'>966</span>
ously the possibility of continuing to do a postgraduate year, and in the end I decided it would be unnecessary. In my own experience the vast majority of young men who go to university and who are intent upon farming come to the conclusion that a postgraduate year is quite unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps in his remarks my hon. Friend will stress again that the whole purpose of the clauses now being debated is to remove cases of hardship. I do not think any hon. Member would not wish to see the improvement of agricultural education in the widest sense, but we are trying to remove hardship. Surely some of what has been said by hon. Members opposite has nothing to do with hardship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I have used this word "hardship" regularly during the course of my remarks. Hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if we accept that hardship is the

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I do not believe it is right that Parliament should say to every owner-occupier or farmer "You should do this or you should do that". I do not take that view. If the hon. Member takes that kind of Marxist view that is something with which we on this side disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to ensure that within the seven-year period three years are spent on academic courses. That would mean that only two years would be spent in practical farming. Two years only of practical farming is not enough for somebody who is going to set tin as a farmer. I must stress the importance of practical experience in farming as well as academic training. Both are absolutely vital. It is essential that as many young people as possible who embark on farming have both academic and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>967</span>
practical experience before they do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our amendment (
	<i>o</i>) is to change the situation whereby a young man over the seven years before his father's death could have spent three years at university, two years on the farm and two years going round the world perhaps. Our view is that those two years' practical experience are insufficient in most cases for a young man to set up as a farmer. The amendment seeks to exempt from the three-year proviso any time he might have spent on the farm during the three-year period at university. Practical experience in farming is best achieved over a longer period rather than during little periods at Christmas, Easter and during the harvest period in the summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would the hon. Member deal with the case where the farmer dies during the year in which his son graduates, or perhaps the year after?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is a borderline case, as hon. Members opposite seem to be suggesting, how would the hon. Member deal with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must ask the Government that question. This is a practical difficulty implicit in the new clause as it stands. If there is a young man who left school, say, when he was 17, and whose father dies at the end of the seven-year period, when the young man is 24, and if he has spent two years going round the world, or two years in the Army—as used to be the case—two years working and three years at university but has not spent even one year of practical experience, he will have another year's practical work to do under the terms of the clause as it stands, as I understand the clause. It will be too bad. The young man will be excluded. He will not be an eligible person—I think quite rightly. I think it would be unreasonable to expect a young man to take over a farm tenancy if he had had only one year's practical experience on the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress again the importance of both academic and practical experience. The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West, who has gone, and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor, who is still here, are both schoolmasters. In that sphere
	<span class='label label-info column'>968</span>
there is a classic example. Young people are taught to teach in a teachers' training college where they are taught the nuts and bolts of what they are going to teach to their pupils. No one suggests that they are then to be let loose willy-nilly on the young people. They then embark on a practical course of teaching which overlaps with the academic training. This is a perfectly clear example applicable to the need for agricultural training. Any hon. Members with experience of engineering will take the same view. No one would let the young engineer, just after he had finished at university, loose to build bridges all over the world before he had practical experience of turning into practice what he had learned at the university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the purpose of Amendment (
	<i>o</i>). Three years' experience at university with two years' practical work is not enough for a young man starting farming. He should have a further year of practical experience. The Parliamentary Secretary, when asked whether he would qualify to farm as a tenant's son under the provisions of this new clause, said he would not. I do not know much about where the Parliamentary Secretary spent his life. I do not know how much practical experience he had working on his father's farm, but unless he has had a two-year period—unless he is highly exceptional—I would have thought it would be wrong for him to take over the tenancy, not having had the practical experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been interrupted a great deal. I am sorry I have been so long. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will say that he sees the purposes of our amendments and agrees with them and that, although they may need some change in detail, he accepts the spirit of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should preface my remarks by saying that I have no personal interests in this matter. The legislation applies only to England and Wales. There is no question of my having a vested interest in the decision. I have no aspirations to take over the tenancy of my father's farm, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of this whole argument is the fact that the Government have taken the view from the outset, as have all hon. Members, that the right to apply to the ALT for the tenancy of a holding should be a qualified right and should not be an automatic succession for any son. When
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>969</span>
we decide that, inevitably, there has to be a cut-off point. Inevitably we have to draw the line somewhere, and that means there will always be some people who will fall outside it and who will fail to qualify as eligible persons as far as the ALT is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided that it was important that the son should have some association with the holding and that he should have worked five out of the previous seven years on the holding in order to be deemed a suitable applicant for the tenancy. As soon as we took that decision it struck me that if we did not make any concession—if I could use that word, though it is, perhaps, not quite the one—for farmers' sons who wanted to go to university or college we would have built in a real deterrent, particularly in the situation where, perhaps, the farmer and father was not healthy, or was, perhaps, getting on in years. Naturally if the son aspired to take over the holding he would be positively deterred from going to any form of higher education because his overriding objective would be to clock up the five years in order that he should be an eligible person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) was right when he said that the criterion which has been used in this new clause is exactly the same criterion as is currently contained in the Smallholdings (Selection of Tenants) Regulations 1970. So it does have a precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have got to consider this matter carefully. First of all one could argue that the position of the smallholding is a specialised one where we are by definition talking about a small unit where we would expect the tenant to be spending a large proportion of his time working practically on the holding, whereas in the case of a larger farm one would not necessarily expect this to be the case. The Government have given careful thought to this and have listened carefully to the arguments and representations on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "agricultural education" is narrowly drawn. It applies only to university courses—agricultural degree courses at Reading or Wye for example, schools of agriculture such as the Harper Adams Agriculture College, or colleges of agriculture such as the traditional county council institute. My hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>970</span>
Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) and others have argued that this should be widened to enable farmers' sons to study subjects other than agriculture at university, and, furthermore, spend four out of the five years rather than three in this period of higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have thought about this carefully. I would argue that it is restrictive in the sense that one could have instances where the son could well want to take a wider training which would be helpful and relevant to his future farming career; for example, where the son might want to take a course in business management, or take some of the basic agricultural sciences. Is it really the case that we want to exclude someone who has, perhaps, done a degree in agricultural science but who, having had that experience, wants to live and farm with his father? After all, he will have had to work two years full-time on the holding, in addition to training at university. So that is a pretty good safeguard to meet the situation where the son, immediately on qualifying at school, went off to university and entered into training which had nothing to do with agriculture, and did not spend a single year on the holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards the two years, is it continuous work on the holding and not intermittent, such as in vacations from university and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we have said in the clause is that the five years could be in two periods, where it is five out of seven. So this would apply also to the rest. We are simply talking about education as part of the five years, so there could still be a split there. The important point is that the near relative has clocked up five years, three of which can be at college, but there can be a gap of a year between college and gaining the agricultural experience, and it can be at either the beginning or the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the comments which have been made, and particularly in view of the remarks of my hon. Friends, we have decided to broaden this definition by accepting Amendment (
	<i>a</i>), but not to accept Amendment (
	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would make this point to my hon. Friend, who may be disappointed that we cannot also accept four years. If a son
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>971</span>
has done a four- or five-year course and then comes back to work on the farm, as soon as he has done his two years he has clocked up his qualification, because the last three years of the four- or five-year course will be eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that this is a fair balance. It would be too restrictive and narrow to lay down that it must be agricultural education. Remember that the Agricultural Land Tribunal will be charged with responsibility for seeing that the individual is a fit person for farming a holding; that once he becomes an eligible person he still has to go through the next hurdle, where the landlord can object and argue that, though he is an eligible person, he is not a suitable person to take over the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other two amendments. As regards the amendment which lays down that where an educational course is being taken in place of a year's work on the holding, a person must pass his exams and get the relevant qualification, it has been pointed out that this could create some hardship where a son found it impossible to complete his course, perhaps because his father was taken ill, and had to go back to the farm. I would not put too much emphasis on qualifications. Far too frequently now in this world we put too much emphasis on academic qualifications, although experience is equally important. Many people are self-educated. Indeed, the hon. Member for Holland with Boston made the point in relation to his own specialised legal profession, that many of the more able and effective people in some walks of life have not acquired the appropriate academic qualifications. I happen to think that training at a university or college is a very vital experience. It helps to broaden one's outlook, to help one think more clearly and to evaluate the difference between facts and opinions. But I certainly would not rely too heavily on the nature of the qualification which one receives. The hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Joplin;) appeared to concede that he felt this would be somewhat rigid and demanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendment (
	<i>o</i>), I must say to the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr.Stainton)—with whom I often agree on this Committee, if that is not embarrassing to him—that I did
	<span class='label label-info column'>972</span>
not find it ambiguous. I thought it was fairly clear. What it is saying is that where three years have been spent in agricultural education it will not be enough to do two of the remaining four on a farm, and in that situation a person will have to do three out of four. In other words, in that situation the total requirement becomes six years, which is arguable. That is certainly how I read the amendment, and, once again, it is a little restrictive. I have stressed that such a person will have had to work two years on the holding. I would not want to go so far as to say that, where he has taken advantage of the educational qualification, we should somehow impose a more stringent requirement than two years' practical work on the holding. Two years with the higher education, the broader education, will, I hope—if hon. Members agree to the amendment—be a fair balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, this is all a question of judgment. Obviously, there can be no hard and fast question of being right or wrong. We are trying to achieve a fair balance. We have listened very carefully to the views of hon. Members and have decided that, on balance, it would be better to broaden the definition "agricultural education" and enable it to include educational experience at a higher institute. I hope that hon. Members will agree with our views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let this occasion pass without welcoming the remarks of my hon. Friend, and the fact that he is accepting our Amendment (
	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is a great deal of confusion in the minds of hon. Members about the differences between education and training. We certainly believe in agricultural training, but agricultural education is another matter. We are talking about education, and that is why we want to broaden the definition. A degree in agriculture is not necessary for a farmer, but training in agriculture is vital. That is why a degree is not essential, but it is very good if there is higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the four-year course, graduates qualifying as teachers have a four-year course at university, and engineers also have a four-year course—sandwich courses, six months out and six months in—and one needs to be an engineer to work on a farm. In view of my hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>973</span>
Friend's remarks, I will accept that a person who does a four-year course can still qualify. I welcome very warmly the fact that people will still have this right to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take exception to a remark by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body). It may be an accident, but it keeps cropping up. He mentioned a compulsory takeover, but there is nothing in the Bill which says that a relative can compulsorily demand a tenancy. The fact that he has the right to apply to the ALT is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has come out of this debate, and I am sure that it can only lead to the improvement of agriculture if people can pursue university courses and so on. If we were to pursue logically the arguments of hon. Members opposite we should have to demand that Members of Parliament take a course in political science and achieve a qualification in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, let me say that the remarks of the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) were, as always, Marxist meanderings. He described what I said as totally irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, I was speaking specifically to my amendments. But a lot of what has been said has been taken on board and referred to by the Minister, so the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West must also direct his remarks about rubbish to his hon. Friend on the Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am absolutely amazed that the Minister has been prepared to recommend to the Committee that it should accept Amendment (
	<i>a</i>), which seeks to leave out the words "in agriculture". I referred in an intervention, when my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) was speaking, to the fact that these clauses are
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
being put into this Bill by the Government in order to remove cases of hardship. As we go through this Bill, the Government seem to be widening still further the scope of eligibility, which is placing the bias nearer and nearer the tenant and the range of people who can apply, and further and further away from and to the disadvantage of the landowner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can only say to the Minister that he is going against all the advice of the industry in accepting this amendment. He is going against the advice of those on the Agricultural Training Board, against the advice of those in agricultural training establishments, whether they be universities or local authority institutes, or fine schools like Harper Adams or the Cirencester College. If the Pilkington Committee were sitting now, I am convinced that it would also disagree with the decision which the Parliamentary Secretary seems to have made, and no doubt hopes his friends will accept when it comes to a Division. I must say—and I am speaking for my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland—that we could not possibly accept this amendment and we shall put it to a Division, because under the heading Education and Training, the Pilkington Report gave these principles:
	<br><blockquote><p>…we have been guided by the following principles:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<i>First</i>—Further education, insofar as it is distinguishable from practical (industrial) training, may be regarded as being generally the responsibility of the education authorities;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<i>second</i>—practical (industrial) training may be regarded as being generally the responsibility of industry; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>
	<i>third</i>—further education and industrial training are complementary aspects of a single process and must be planned and supervised as a whole."</p></blockquote>
That is important and is very sound indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me go further and quote from Chapter 1 of the same report, dealing with examinations. The Minister seemed to imply that examinations are not at all important, and I find that extraordinary, but the report clearly stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"
	<i>First</i> Courses must fit the needs of industry and students".</p></blockquote>
The amendment of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick), which has now been accepted by the Parliamentary Secretary, deals only with the interests of the students, but the Pilkington Committee stated that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>975</span>
must fit the needs of industry as well as students, and examinations should fit the courses. The report went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"
	<i>Second</i> Teaching establishments should have freedom, within the context of the basic course content, to evolve their own teaching syllabuses and teaching methods ",</p></blockquote>
and I entirely agree with that.

The paragraph continues:

In taking the course he has, the Minister is going against the recommendations of the agriculture industry and all the learned people who sat for some time considering the needs of agriculture and agricultural education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to what Mr. Huckle said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"education is learning how to learn and training is learning how to put into practice what has been learned."</p></blockquote>
It is vital that a person who is thrown into the difficult task of taking over a holding, whether it be expected or sudden because of the death of a parent, must have some understanding of agriculture. Inevitably that person must be someone who is hell bent on making agriculture his career and livelihood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Committee will reject Amendment (
	<i>a</i>), which the Government are prepared to accept, and give sympathetic consideration to Amendment (
	<i>o</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised when the Parliamentary Secretary accepted

Amendment (
	<i>a</i>). I understand the principle and I see nothing wrong and much good in taking broad courses. I wish that I could have had the chance to take broad courses in many subjects instead of just studying for my professional examinations. Here we are considering someone who badly wants to follow his father in a holding, and before he can go before the ALT he must have taken a course in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look again at Amendment (
	<i>o</i>). The safeguards provided by the amendment are even more important now than they were before. If Amendment (

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has said it all, but I wish to put two questions to the Minister in view of his extraordinary statement. If the Minister is prepared to accept Amendment (
	<i>a</i>), which provides that the period of academic training need not be in agriculture, how does he justify his acceptance of the amendment on Tuesday to the effect that the work that is done must be in agriculture? A young man might spend three years on a course which had nothing to do with agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a young man can claim to be an eligible person for the tenancy if over the previous seven years he has spent two years working on the farm, three years at a university reading Arabic, and two years doing something which has nothing to do with agriculture. Does not the Parliamentary Secretary have some qualms about a person with two years practical experience who has spent five years out of the previous seven years on nothing whatever to do with agriculture? It is utterly illogical. If the Parliamentary Secretary can explain those two points, we might take a different attitude to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no comparison between Amendment (
	<i>a</i>) and the amendment we discussed on Tuesday when we wished to preclude a journalist from the farm. We expect the two years to be spent working on the farm. On the hon.

now that provided a man notches up the two years' experience he can do what he likes with the other five years. He has turned the proposition upside down.

Mr. Costain, I do not wish to question your selection, but it seems to me that we shall have a repetition of the previous debate. Amendment (

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the new clause, Amendment (
	<i>c</i>), in line 75, leave out paragraph (
	<i>f</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated this subject previously both on Second Reading and in Committee so there is not much new information we can share. It is a question of ensuring that we do not create difficult situations and anomalies. In the past people tended to talk about two transfers involving two generations.
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
It is not two generations but two transfers, because the transfers may be from brother to sister or from brother to brother. In that situation the application of the Clause could finish a farm within a year or two. There could quite easily be a situation in which two transfers occur within a couple of years. To my mind that provision is far too restrictive and for that reason alone I am proposing that we leave out paragraph (
	<i>f</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, we are to have a situation where, for example, every farm has to be registered, to decide on such matters as education, and we have to ensure that we keep within the law. I believe this would lead to an impossible situation and I would like the Minister to consider very seriously whether in this provision we are not embarking on a dangerous course. We are breaking new ground and have already done so. This amendment is a further attempt to try to improve the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must come clean. If he removes this provision he will perpetuate the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be. The opportunity would be there, but it would not necessarily apply. This is always a safeguard, and what we have really been seeking is a fair chance for both landlord and tenant and for that reason I would ask my hon. Friend to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Committee is considering this amendment with the others that have been selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it was the wish of the Committee that this should be taken separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case it might be better if my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) caught your eye first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to hear the Minister first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no point in beating about the bush. The amendment of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) means that, provided a tenant farmer can provide a successor
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
falling within the basic requirements, the farm will be let for ever to those eligible people through the normal processes of succession, as set out in the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of the request of the National Farmers' Union, at no time and certainly not in the infamous blue document did it ever suggest that a farm should be let for ever to the same family. As I understand it, its representations have been that the farm should be let for only one succession to the son or close relative of the person concerned. As it is, the new clauses have gone further than the NFU ever envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment really goes to the point where it will no longer be possible to say that the farm belongs to the landlord at all. It will belong effectively in perpetuity to the tenant. If that is the hon. Gentleman's intention he should take advice, for there are other, more honest, ways of ultimately destroying the system. It would seem that this amendment, if accepted, really writes the death knell of the system in every possible manner. I and some of my hon. Friends believe that these proposals already go too far, and that to accept such an amendment would be the final death knell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, and although I appreciate the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman for opposing it I feel he would have done better not to have attacked my hon. Friend in the way he has done, suggesting that he was trying to destroy the system. My hon. Friend made a very valid point, a genuine one which, I hope, the Minister will take on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are writing into the Bill a number of very specific things. I begin to see the Bill as a very complex one which will create a degree of hardship unless it can be made slightly more flexible. I have referred to my own misgivings in relation to subsection 3(
	<i>b</i>). This morning we have debated something which, I believe, will cause genuine hardship by making ineligible to succeed sons whose fathers died before they could possibly, by reason of age, have completed seven years' working on the holding. These are cases where genuine hardship, quite apart from injustice, could arise. There are a number of cases, and particularly that which we are discussing, where a set of circum-
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
stances, though not common or usual, could arise; and we could literally be excluding the possibility of succession to a tenancy within two to five years, which is clearly outside the meaning of the Bill and what we are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Somewhere between the view of the hon. Member for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) and my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) there lies a happy mean. It seems to me there is an opportunity for the Minister to take on board the fact that such a happy mean may be prevented by the way the Bill is drawn, thus giving him an opportunity to bring forward other amendments allowing an amount of discretion to the tribunal to cover the serious point of the father dying before the son can physically have completed seven years' working on the holding, and secondly, to overcome the difficulty of this clause which, clearly, is not intended to take out the possibility of succession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks of the concept of hardship. The most ardent protagonist of the Bill has drawn a picture of a man gaining a living from the holding, Now he is talking of people who have not even been on the holding earning a living. He must decide what is the principal hardship and must not start introducing other concepts late in the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made clear that as far as I am concerned the principal hardship is something which has been introduced by the Government. I am much more concerned with the concept of justice. I believe justice and hardship combine, particularly in the case of a family who may have lost their breadwinner and been deprived of their means of livelihood, which is one of the most extreme cases of hardship which may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to push this matter, but in support of my hon. Friend I must say I hope the Government will take an opportunity of looking again at one or two of the inflexible points being put into the Bill, points which I do not believe it is the wish of the Committee to see written into it in such a way that there is no possible opportunity after a couple of nominal exchanges for the farmer to continue to be in tenancy of the farm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend. We are not dealing here with generations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>983</span>
but with new transfers which can happen within a very short space of time—two, five or six years. Apart from the examples of hardship which have been given by my hon. Friend I feel that we shall not solve problems of hardship and injustices by postponing them, even on a generation basis. I cannot see the logic of saying we may have an eligible person succeeding but that in a couple of years there will be an ineligible person succeeding. I do not see how we can envisage a situation where there is hardship to a tenant in 1976, and hardship to the family and the spouse of a tenant then, and say that for some reason that hardship will not exist in 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union is of intelligent people and they realise the situation. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a certain illogicality in limiting a scheme largely based on hardship to two transfers beyond the existing tenancy. However, in the numerous discussions between the Union and the Country Landowners Association on this subject in recent months, the landlords' representatives have strongly argued that a limitation of the number of transfers would encourage landlords voluntarily to grant new tenancies. The Union therefore accepts that limitation, since it will overcome existing hardship cases, and give ample opportunity to study how the scheme operates in practice."</p></blockquote>
They accept the limitation for two reasons, one being that the provision will help to deal with existing hardship cases. The only way we can legislate for existing hardship cases is to have retrospective legislation, which we do not have. I tried to deal with that point, but was shot down in flames on it. Such transfers can occur twice within three years and, therefore, I cannot really accept the argument that has been advanced, largely, I suspect, and not surprisingly, so as to help to keep good relations with landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is suggested that ample opportunity will be given to study how the scheme operates in practice, so that we may come back to it when we see how it operates. Through the attitude of the NFU we see clearly a recognition of the illogicality of the limit and the recognition that the scheme should be extended
	<span class='label label-info column'>984</span>
or be left open. I would say there is no case for legislating in this way. It is no good saying we are going to deal with only one or two forms of hardship but will try to deal with future cases of hardship so far as they can be envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole basis of the British Parliament is that there is the sovereignty of Parliament and that it cannot be bound by previous Parliaments. We can change the law. This is our Constitution. It is, therefore, a very dangerous precedent to say we are bringing in legislation to deal with enormous hardship and injustice but that we will limit it to two such cases. It is like saying we will pass a pension for widows but the next generation of widows will not get a pension. We cannot do that type of thing. It is the introduction of a very serious principle that I have never heard applied in any other aspect of British law, and I chat lenge the Chairman or the Committee to tell me of anywhere that this has occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now deal with the other argument, that this may have the effect of encouraging landlords to seek new tenants. If a landlord is reluctant to grant a tenancy he will be reluctant to grant one on a basis of this law because it may last for 50 years. We do not know how long the new tenancy will last. Certainly, 50 years is a fairly long time for anyone. I do not believe we can distinguish between 50 years in the case of one tenant when over two long generations the period may be 100 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
