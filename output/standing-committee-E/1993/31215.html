	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>FISHING FLEETS CAPACITY</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Scrutiny Committee has recommended that, alongside the documents referred to in the motion which we shall debate later, we should consider a commission working paper on the measures that member states are taking to meet their current multi-annual guidance programmes. I hope that my comments on it this morning will be helpful to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first document that we shall consider is the European Court of Auditors report on the implementation of measures for the restructuring, modernisation and adaptation of the capacities of fishing fleets. The report reviews the structural measures in place throughout the Community during the period 1987–91 and examines the efficacy of the multi-annual guidance programmes for managing structural policy. The report includes an audit of the effectiveness of the different forms of aid, including the decommissioning grant. The criticisms to which it refers are now being considered by the Commission and member states through the framing of new measures, such as the proposed regulation on structural assistance. More generally, the report displays a certain scepticism about the value of decommissioning expenditure on its own. Given last night's debate in the House, members of the Committee will not be suprised to learn that the Government share those views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote one important paragraph from the report. I referred to it in July when we debated the Fishing Vessels (Decommissioning) Scheme 1993 and again in last night's debate. However, for the sake of honourable Members who were not in the Chamber last night, I shall repeat the paragraph, which is relevant to the matters that we shall be discussing. In the report, the Court of Auditors said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It must be said that since the CFP was instituted the technological changes in the fishing sector had been so big that catch and detection facilities have now reached such a level of perfection that the traditional balance between fishing and resources has been destroyed. Any resource can now be located and exploited with an efficiency that has never been known in all the time that man has been exploiting fish resources."</p></blockquote>
That quotation lays specific emphasis on the responsibility that we all have to bring back into a more sensible balance the relationship between catching capacity with in the Community and the volume offish in the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second document that we shall debate is the Commission's report on the results of the transitional guidance programme, which was designed to fill the gap between the 1987–91 multi-annual guidance programme targets and the current multi-annual guidance programmes, which were not agreed until the end of last year. The report is factual and shows that performance against MAGP targets is monitored carefully by the Community institutions. We must bear that in mind as we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
consider how we can achieve the targets in our current MAGP. Any shortfall will be picked up in future reports and we must recognise that if we do not meet our targets, our negotiating position on other fronts may be weakened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third report is a Commission paper on national measures to control fishing effort. It reflects a major innovation in the current MAGP targets—namely, the requirement to restrict fishing effort to bring it into line with what the stocks will bear. That implies reduction in capacity and an adjustment of activity. At least 53 per cent of the overall targets must be achieved by capacity reductions. The remaining 45 per cent may be achieved by measures to reduce activity. It is worth noting that even member states intending to meet their targets by capacity reductions alone must monitor the activity of remaining vessels to ensure that overall effort does not increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report describes the measures that member states are taking to control effort and divides them into three groups: those operating or intending to operate days-at-sea regimes, such as the Netherlands, those operating closures, such as the weekend bans on fishing in Greece, Spain and Portugal, and other member states which are not controlling effort at all except indirectly through licensing and quota restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document was prepared at the start of the current MAGP and does not give complete information on member states' plans for meeting their targets. However, we now know that all member states are likely to be operating decommissioning schemes to a greater or lesser extent. The Commission insists that all member states should submit data on the activities of their fleets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom target under the current MAGP is a 19 per cent. reduction, which we had aimed to achieve by a combination of capacity reductions of 10.5 per cent. and activity reductions of 8.5 per cent. As I said last night, the Government are suspending days at sea and will now consider the way forward. I also made clear last night that I cannot anticipate the outcome of those considerations. However, it is clear from the documents and from what I have said this morning that we face a conservation problem, that fishing effort must indeed be reduced and that the task will require a combination of measures. That is spelled out in the motion, which we shall soon debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to Question Time, which goes on until 11.30 a.m. I would appreciate short, single questions—and, if possible, short replies—so that I can include as many hon. Members as possible, including those who are strangers to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Court of Auditors made criticisms about value for money. Do those criticisms include money spent on tie-up grants, used by Spain and others? The Minister spoke of a 19 per cent. reduction in MAGP. I know that he realises that some of the boats on our register had a low level of activity, which artifically boosted the UK fishing fleet and therefore overstated our actual capacity. Is the Minister satisfied that this issue has been resolved within his target?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: in deference to your request to be brief, Mr. Hill, I refer the hon. Gentleman to the conclusions on page 102 of the Court of Auditors report, especially item 5.1(b), which gives a good summary of the reasons for the criticisms. On the hon. Gentleman's second point, I am aware of the items that formed part of the statistical base
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
from which our targets were calculated. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that has not gone unnoticed by me; I will consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question is more general; it concerns the paper on national measures and what Spain is supposed to be doing or not doing—about which I am rather sceptical. What attempt does the Ministry make to monitor Spain's activities in meeting its obligations—either those imposed by the European Community or those set out in the paper on national measures? What mechanism is there to tell the Minister what is going on in La Coruna and other Spanish ports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that on behalf of the fisherman in his constituency, my hon. Friend is deeply concerned about the activities of Spanish fishermen. His questions concerns enforcement under the common fisheries policy. The United Kingdom carefully monitors the activities of Spanish vessels, using enforcement mechanisms such as the Royal Navy fishing inspectors. As my hon. Friend knows, a prosecution occured yesterday in which an Anglo-Spanish vessel was fined £102,000 and has its licence taken away for two years. That shows that enforcement is effective. We also receive reports from other member states; for example, at the most recent Fisheries Council, the Irish Minister enunciated a list of breaches of enforcement that he had discovered. All such information is used when I meet the Commissioner, as I did recently, to point out our concern about Spain's approach to enforcement. Monitoring Spain's achievement of its multi-annual guidance programme targets is a matter for the Commission, because those are Community targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister tell us whether his abandonment of the proposed measures is permanent or whether it is a temporary bargaining position? The pressures currently being put on the fishing fleet are intolerable. It is impossible for those running boats to plan ahead if they have no idea how long restrictions will operate, what regime will apply in the future or what the cost will be. Will the Minister assure us that what he proposes will be made clear very soon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for her question. The most important thing enabling fisherman to plan for their future is certainty that there will be fish of different species to catch. Everybody agrees with that. The problem is that not everybody agrees how we can achieve the long-term conservation of stocks. "Conservation" is an interesting word. It does not mean freezing in aspic the fish that are in the sea; it means maintaining a level of spawning-stock biomass that will, year-class by year-class, maintain an adequate supply offish for our fishermen to acquire. The measures that we took were a brave attempt to recognise the need for a capacity reduction in the United Kingdom industry and a realisation that, to achieve that reduction, the remaining fishing effort of vessels still in the fleet would have to be constrained. I sought by my announcement yesterday to remove uncertainty over the deadline of 1 January for the introduction of the so-called "days-at-sea" policy. The industry now knows that that policy will not be implemented while the European Court is considering the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The second point that I made yesterday was that in the light of that case, we should now consider carefully how to achieve our existing Community effort-reduction obligations, which remain before us. As I said in last night's debate. I intend to press for a meeting with the Commissioner early in the new year to review the situation and thereafter to make an announcement as quickly as I can to remove the further doubts that underlie the hon. Lady's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press my hon. Friend the Minister further on the point that I put to him a few moments ago? I appreciate that it is the responsibility of the Commission to police Spanish activities, but I think that we are all dissatisfied with the way in which it approaches that responsibility. Do we have an agricultural attaché at our embassy in Madrid? If so, how much time does he spend in the north of Spain, nosing around—as I have done on many occasions, and I have always been horrified—to see what is happening? What reports does the Minister receive from that attache? On my tours around embassies with the Select Committee on European Legislation, I find that there is a glaring gap in what the embassies are doing. They should not monitor in detail, but should check—as we do as Members of Parliament—what is going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. When I first took over responsibility for this area, I pressed our agricultural attaché in Spain to acquire hard data on inspection in Spain. That inquiry elicited the fact that the Spanish Government were recruiting more fishing inspectors. Much has been made of the fact that those concerned appear to be in land-locked Madrid; it is suggested that not too many fishing boats reach that far inland. We do not dispute that fact, but we believe that it is the civil and marine guards and customs officers who are supposed to enforce the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put particular weight on reports gleaned by our fishing inspectors from their opposite numbers. I have said to Commissioner Paleokrassas—I put it bluntly—that if we do not have confidence in the enforcement of a common fisheries policy by all member states, our fishermen cannot be expected to respect those rules. I also presented him with a copy of the "Cook Report" video. His response was positive; he understood my point. I think that under the new enforcement regulation, he will wish to bring forward some proposals to improve the effectiveness of the way in which Community inspectors operate. Pooling intelligence is one idea that he has in mind. I shall continue to emphasise my point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister a question that has been asked many times during debates on decommissioning? I am not aware of it having been answered. It concerns the net cost of decommissioning. How much of the money spent on decommissioning does the Treasury recoup through taxation? The Minister will recall that I attempted to amend last year's Finance Bill to allow decommissioning sums to be paid out tax free. The amendment was defeated. What is the return to the Treasury on tax from sums paid out on decommissioning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer that question. The hon. Gentleman will probably know—he will have studied the matter in considerable detail—that taxation and the receipt of decommissioning grants vary according to the situation of individual fishermen. On any balance sheet, certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
expenses can be defrayed against the receipt of moneys from whatever source. The accounts of individual fishing enterprises determine whether some benefits of a decommissioning grant are taken away through taxation. I am not an expert on tax, but I believe that the cost of decommissioning the boat, for example, could be an allowable expense against tax. It is a matter for the individual, his accountant and the taxman. I am not responsible for such matters and I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an accumulated figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explore a few areas that did not hang together in the Minister's comments on decommissioning? He cites the documents before us to explain that a range of member states do not regard decommissioning on its own as an acceptable way in which to meet the MAGP targets. The documents also suggest that for almost all member states, decommissioning is part of the process. Decommissioning has been blown off course in the days-at-sea limitation, but it has also been suspended, in effect, from March 1994. Why is it not possible for the Minister to say—regardless of other proposals he may wish to bring forward—that decommissioning will be part of the package next year and the following year? Why is it not possible to establish one fixed point in the sea of uncertainty? Merely to cite the argument from the documents that decommissioning on its own is not enough does not answer that question. Will the Minister deal with that specific question, which he managed to work his way round in last night's debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to shine more light on the matter. The hon. Gentleman is right; decommissioning forms an important part of the approach of many member states to effort reduction. Both sides of the House admitted last night that decommissioning, only with effort reduction, is an important part of getting the gains, especially in terms of its effect on fishing boats remaining in action afterwards. We have lost sight of why days at sea was originally proposed. That proposal attempted to put a loose corset, with the strings let out a bit, around the remainder of the industry after boats had been taken out in an effort to constrain fishing efforts. If pressure on fish stocks is reduced, one cannot allow the slack to be taken up by remaining boats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know what the hon. Gentleman is getting at. I remind him that I made my views clear in the debate on decommissioning in the Chamber. I said that when the remaining policy on decommissioning was clearly in view, we should want to look at the lessons that we had learnt from the first tranche of decommissioning—which will continue to finality. We want to see how it has worked and whether adjustments to the eligibility criteria are needed. We have not yet reached the end of the first tranche of decommissioning. I went as far as I could to confirm to the House last night that those who had applied for part one, and whose applications had been accepted as fulfilling the scheme's criteria, would receive their money within the date and time that I specified in the parliamentary question. I said that I would carefully consider the representations received on subsequent decommissioning in the light of the changed circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, we have not learnt the lessons because we have not reached the end of the scheme. We have never given cast-iron timing for the next stage of decommissioning because we are still learning about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
first scheme. I want the opportunity to discuss with the Commission and the industry where we go from here. We all agreed last night that decommissioning per se, without some element of effort control, would not deliver the full value. Those are important matters which we must consider. The questions being asked are not lost on me, and I have taken proper note of what has been said. One or two hon. Members were kind enough to say after the debate that they understood the position and that we needed time to think through our policy carefully. I am well aware of our Community targets on effort reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister prepared to talk seriously about enforcement and the existing controls used in other cases? For example, satellites are used in merchant shipping. The Commission is spending vast amounts, without any obvious effect. As enforcement is fundamental, the Commission should be examining other methods outwith the existing inadequate terms. Frankly, no one will accept a common fisheries policy that means that some nations suffer directly and inappropriately while others can do what they like. Clearly, enforcement is not working, so will the Minister consider other methods to ensure that it does?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady has seen other Community documents, she would know that under the new enforcement regulation, which will apply from 1 January, a trial using satellite technology in all member states is proposed. The location of fishing vessels will be known. We have put forward our own United Kingdom proposition that automatic position recorders should be used in the trial. I have seen printouts from using such equipment; it is an effective way in which to show where a vessel is at a particular time. Both those methods will be used in trials. The hon. Lady is right to say that enforcement is a key issue. As I said to the Commissioner, if people do not believe that the rules are being followed by other member states, how can I persuade our fishermen to play the rules? The hon. Lady has my assurance and that of the Commission that trials will take place using the technology to which she referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to the vexed question of capacity. In the context of the European Communities (Spanish and Portugese Accession) Act 1985, will the Minister clarify the legal base that the Government will use in their discussion with the Council of Ministers? Will they continue to base their proposals on articles 162 and 350, as has been suggested? Will the Minister assure us that there will be no diminution of that stance? Will he also advice us what steps are being taken under the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1992 to prevent the use of hidden fish rooms in the Spanish trawlers that so often operate in our seas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a point of detail that I should explain. It is not the United Kingdom Government who are proposing the changes under the European Communities (Spanish and Portuguese Accession) Act 1985. We made it clear that the legal base of the initial Commission paper on this was suspect in legal terms. That has now been replaced by a presidency proposal, and other compromise ideas may come forward at the Council meeting. At the previous Council, the advice of the Commission's legal services department was sought. It agreed that the presidency
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
compromise proposal was in accord with articles 162 and 352 of the treaty. On that basis, all member states agreed that the matter could go forward for discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was article 350.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have the articles in front of me. Article 352, interlocking with article 162, is the legal base on which the matter is being considered. If hon. Members want to press me on article 350, I shall certainly deal with it, but I assure them that the matter was clarified by the Commission's legal services department. The reference to article 350 may be due to the fact that hon. Members have seen exchanges of correspondence between me and a well-known Member of the European Parliament, in which articles 162 and 350 were queried. I assure hon. Members that the Commission's legal services department has pronounced on the doubts concerning the original Commission proposal. That has been withdrawn and we shall now consider compromise proposals from the presidency and possibly from other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about hidden fish rooms. She will be aware that we closed a legal loophole that was inhibiting prosecutions in that regard. We now require all vessels to carry maps of their fish rooms so that we can track them down and, if necessary, seek appropriate prosecution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend a question relating to the special report by the Court of Auditors, specifically pages 74, 75 and 76? Those pages contain criticisms by the Court of the way in which some member states, including Spain, Germany, France and Italy, have provisions for what can be described only as national aids to their fishermen. In some cases, the money paid to the fishermen has been above the 30 per cent. limit laid down by Community regulations. The Court of Auditors points out those breaches. Does my hon. Friend know what action, if any, has been taken to recoup money paid by the Community which should not have been paid? It is clear that surplus amounts have been paid. What attempts are being made to get the money back from those countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reasonable though my knowledge is of some of the issues that we are discussing, that is not one that I have had an opportunity to study in detail. I recall seeing a long list of recovery money some time ago in a Court of Auditors report. I will investigate the matter and write to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On several occasions last night and today, the Minister has said that he believes that decommissioning should not operate on its own, and that back-up measures are needed. He said last night that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the maximum effectiveness of decommissioning is derived when the central issue of effort control for the remainder of the fleet is addressed. In all honesty, nobody can run away from that point."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 December 1993; Volume 234, column 901.]</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister familiar with papers that were presented as part of the case of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations in the High Court? One paper by Mr. C. E. Tucker, dated 30th August 1991, was entitled "An analysis of the change in individual vessel activity levels over the period 1983–1990". It concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the catch per unit effort (and/or real prices) have risen, which would be the eventual impact of decommissioning a reasonable proportion of the UK fleet, the general trend appears to be for individual vessels to reduce their activity levels. Therefore, in order to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
limit aggregate effort in a post-decommissioning regime, the priority may be to limit any potential growth in capacity as opposed to individual vessel activity levels."</p></blockquote>
There is also a report of the same date by Mr. Gregory Valatin entitled "The impact of a decommissioning scheme on aggregate fishing effort, the variability in effort of similar boats". It concludes with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if a decommissioning scheme was to remove 40 per cent. of the fleet, as some estimates of overcapacity suggest is needed, (and also probably if 25 per cent. of the fleet was decommissioned), the above analysis suggests that (ceteris paribus) the remaining fleet would be unable to expand its efforts to its previous level. Thus in terms of activity levels, in the aftermath of a decommissioning scheme on such a scale the remaining fleet would appear very unlikely to be able to expand its effort to its previous level."</p></blockquote>
Does that not suggest that there is, perhaps, a greater validity in the view that decommissioning can achieve some of those objectives than has been believed to be the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detract from the obvious benefits of decommisioning. We would not have embarked on a programme of spending £25 million of the public's money if we had not thought, learning from the mistakes of the previous scheme, that it might well achieve something. Unfortunately, the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations did not send me all its evidence—that might have been going a shade too far in playing fair in court—so I cannot comment in detail on documents that I have not seen and without knowing what the precise terms and measurements are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first quotation read by the hon. Gentleman mentioned the subject of growth in capacity. One needs to study the word "capacity" very carefully because, as the hon. Gentleman knows, there are several definitions of it. The one that we use relates to vessel capacity units and to the fact that there are different ways, within the existing size of a fishing vessel, in which to increase its fishing capacity, such as putting a larger engine into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, I would welcome the opportunity to study that evidence to know precisely what the gentleman who wrote the report meant by the use of the word "capacity". One problem is that although we might end up with a fleet of a given size after a decommissioning scheme, the efficiency of the remaining fleet could increase unless there was some restraint on capacity development. That is why licence aggregation, one of the forgotten elements in reducing efforts, puts a penalty on increasing effort by, for example, joining boats together to make a so-called "bigger" boat. There is a 20 per cent capacity reduction penalty on that and, beyond certain limits, there are capacity reduction penalties on engine sizes. As one who studies those matters carefully, I am sure that the hon Gentleman will be aware of the many variations on the subject of capacity. It must be considered most carefuly, otherwise one can be seduced by a simplistic argument and end up with the remaining fleet having a greater catching capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Gentleman's second point, I repeat that I have not read the report. I should want to examine carefully the assumptions that it makes because with more intensive manning of vessels, who knows, what could be done? I do not want to speculate about that. We must reflect on the point that we need to have some constraint on the fishing effort of the remainder of the fleet if we are to get the full value of decommissioning. Without having studied Mr. Valatin's analysis, I do not want to go further at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that both the Select Committee on European Legislation and the Court of Auditors report highlight the political implications of what is happening. The Select Committee asks for the matter to be reconsidered, not least because it has discovered factual differences in some of the tables and has corrected the percentages contained in the original Commission document. That must have direct implications for any decisions that are taken and the House of Commons would be failing in its duty if it did not carefully study what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister comment on the parts of the Court of Auditors report that relate directly to the Commission's method of appraising aid applications, applying regulations late and, in some instances, giving a posteriori support to applications that were not properly written? Will he also tell the Committee how the United Kingdom can support Commission policies that are manifestly not working and are not factually supportable in the decision-making process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my short experience on the Fisheries Council, I often find myself probing policies that I would challenge if they were not properly thought out. The fact that the Court of Auditors—a Commission body—has reported on the matter has taught all member states a lesson about the effectiveness of the common fisheries policy. We differ with our Community partners on such issues. We have a particular and meticulous way of looking at such matters. We probe and ask thorough questions. Others may not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We often find ourselves in the minority when probing the line of argument put by the hon. Lady, because we want policies that work. I find myself in the dock, being criticised, because although we try to learn from mistakes—ours and those of other member states—and to impose clearly defined policies to meet our Community targets, our plans do not always find favour with the industry. At least no one can criticise us for not having a clear and measurable target. As for the rest of the Community, it is my intention to continue to probe and to make certain that those policies can be properly accounted for, thus learning the lesson from the Court of Auditors report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his answer to the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), the Minister spoke of the arguments that he used at the Council of Ministers. As our questions today are vital to the negotiations that start next week, will he ensure that the members of the Committee and other hon. Members who have fishing interests in their constituencies are given a record of what is said at the Council of Ministers? That would be in the interests of transparency, promoted under the Belgian presidency. Although we have no reason to doubt the Minister's words, it would help if we had a written record of the negotiations and discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will have studied 	<i>Hansard</i> and will know that it is my practice, as it was my predecessor's, to issue a statement at the end of the Council meeting, giving a resume of the decisions made, and the positions taken. The hon. Lady also knows that representatives of fishing organisations often attend Council meetings. It is my practice and that of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), to try to keep them up to date in the interests of clarity and transparency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister sounds quite sympathetic to decommissioning. He has said that he needs a little flexibility to reconsider his position after the reversal by the court. He needs time to study the first tranche of the decommissioning scheme. Significantly, both last night and today, when the Minister came to the detail of what he proposes, he read out the response to a written question. That answer gives no quarantee about the future, but simply says that we need to review the way forward. That gives no indication of whether the decommissioning scheme will continue after March next year. If the Minister could say, without specifying exactly what scale of decommissioning scheme he had in mind.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Questions, please,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister say whether decommissioning remains part of his plans for the fishing industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made my position clear on decommissioning last night, when I was challenged on the Floor of the House about whether we had ruled it out. I pointed out that we had not said that we had ruled it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had almost won the argument with the hon. Gentleman when in the first part of his question he was kind enough to mention the problem that we now face-that particular case having been referrd to the European Court. I had hoped that he would put in a full stop before he came to the second half of his question. The short answer is that we wish to consider all options in the light of the changed circumstances in an attempt to meet our Community targets. I do not rule out any of the options available to me. However, as I made it clear last night, and as I have made it clear again today we need time to look carefully at those options. In the new year we shall come to a conclusion and make an announcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last night the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang) asked the Minister, whether, by talking to the Commissioner, there was a possibility of European regulations being made to restrict days at sea. The Minister concluded his answer by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What the Commission may choose to do is up to it."—[	<i>Official report,</i> 14 December 1993; vol 234, c.913.]</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Gentleman have any reason to suspect that the Commission may be considering introducing its own scheme of tie-ups for either United Kingdom fleets or for fleets throughout the European Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the best of my knowledge, that item is not on the agenda for the meeting in December of the Council of Ministers. If, however, the Commission wishes to develop ideas for reducing fishing effort, that is clearly up to it—as I said last night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is decommissioning part of the Minister's future plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said last night and a moment ago, I have not ruled out a range of potential methods to reduce effort with regard to achieving our Community targets. Earlier, I gave what I hope was a helpful answer about the nature of the original decommissioning scheme. I shall certainly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
consider carefully the lessons that we learnt from the first tranche. I do not rule out such action. Obviously, it has a part to play in the overall European position. Other member states have adopted it, but I wish to consider all the options open to us after we have discussed the position with the Commissioner and the industry. As I made it clear last night, if we are to have decommissioning, effort reduction must go alongside it—and that statement was accepted throughout the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We assume that the Minister's preferred course of action would be to implement the days-at-sea regulations. However, events have now taken over that and it is not possible to react to the High Court's decision. Can the Minister, having put the days-at-sea option on ice, identify one measure that he believes will be more effective than a decommissioning scheme, in pursuing the objective fo the MAGP targets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that we have considered several options shows that there is no one solution to reducing fishing effort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is decommissioning part of the Minister's plans? I want a straight answer, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The straight answer is that in considering our future policy, I rule out none of the options that are available on effort reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister a more detailed question about the MAGP targets. I understand that, for the pelagic fleet, Britain has already reached the target set for the end of the MAGP period. Why, prior to the court's decision, were the Government nevertheless intent on applying day-at-sea restrictions to pelagic, vessels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that, in the calculation of the previous target different sectoral allocations were made. We carried over a deficiency from the previous target of 9 per cent., which was distributed within the fleet. I was aware of the representations that he and his Friends made about the relationship between net effort reduction and the pelagic fleet. However, consideration of many of those representations about how we might modify our original proposals for days at sea could not be concluded with the announcement that I had hoped to make that would have shown easements in the original policy. As the matter has now been taken to the European Court, such announcements are no longer relevant. I listened carefully, however, to what the hon. Gentleman and many representatives of the fishing industry said about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The questions are becoming repetitive. Will members of the Committee ask some fresh questions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have participated in fishing debates for many years, and the same issues keep recurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was confusion about the articles under the European Communities (Spanish and Portuguese Accession) Act 1985 on which the presidency document was based. He said that it was based on articles
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
162 and 352. I shall quote from a letter from Sir John Kerr, which I am willing to make available to the Minister. It is dated 29th November and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Articles 162 and 350 of the Act of Accession" are the articles on which the presidency document bases itself. There seems to be considerable confusion, which is not restricted to one side of the relevant correspondence. Perhaps the Minister can shed some light on that matter. It does not augur well for the negotiations if people do not know on which articles the document is based.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely clear upon which articles our proposal is based. Article 350 is relevant, as is article 352. In case the hon. Gentleman did not follow the argument, the legal base of the original proposal made by the Commission was questioned and, effectively, found wanting. It has now been replaced by a presidency compromise. The Community's legal services made it clear that there was a proper legal base for that to be decided by the Council, and we shall proceed on that legal base. Articles 162, 352 and 350 are relevant. There can be no doubt that there is a proper legal base for the decisions to be made. I am clear on that, as are our lawyers and the Community's legal services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill.

	<p>11.16 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley (Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The documents deal with a wide range of matters, many of which are familiar to members of the Committee who have attended fishing debates regularly over the years.

I ought to begin by picking up points made during questions about the decommissioning scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster (Paisley, South)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. While I do not want to challenge your ruling of a moment ago, could you clarify it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Clerk gave me incorrect advice. For a period of time, we did not have a quorum. Now we again have a quorum and may proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill. What would have happened if the correct advice had been given by the Clerk? Would the Committee have been declared inquorate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, but the sitting would have resumed as soon as the quorum was re-established. We now have a magnificent quorum and must continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does the industry a disservice by being evasive about the direction questions that he is being asked about decommissioning. I do not believe that he is suggesting for one moment that we abandon decommissioning as a central feature of structural change within the fishing industry. The documents make it clear that decommissioning must be part of any effective restructuring to match effort to available fish stocks—albeit, as the Minister rightly suggests, as only part of a package. Evasion does no one any good. It would be much more helpful if the Minister said, "For the benefit of the industry, yes, decommissioning will continue." Of course the Minister must have talks with the Commission, particularly in the new circumstances in which he finds himself, but there is no point in playing with the issue and causing concern within the industry. People have to make plans and decide whether to make applications for their boats in the next round. The Minister owes it to the industry to make it clear where it stands and ensure that there is stable progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want anyone to assume that part of the problem with decommissioning has been caused by the recent court case and the doubt that it has thrown on the Government's policy. As we have been saying in these Committees and in debates for many years, the problem is that this country has made little progress in meeting its MAGP targets. The tables circulated with the documents show that the United Kingdom has the worst record of all member states on reducing its fleet in line with targets. The reason we have the worst record is that for years, when Members of Parliament pressed the Minister's predecessors to introduce such a scheme, there was only delay and prevarication. That is why we have such a large overcapacity within our fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Court of Auditors' documents there is some criticism of the Government, especially of their policy on modernisation grants. When it became clear that there was a problem with overcapacity in the UK fleet, our Government were still allocating modernisation grants to increase capacity. There is worse still. On page 82 of the Court of Auditor's document paragraph (c) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"particularly in Denmark and the United Kingdom, the necessary checks to verify compliance with the provisions of Article 9(3)c of Regulation (EEC) No. 4028/86 (according to which modernisation work should not exceed 50 per cent. of the value of a new vessel of the same type as the one being modernised) are not systematically carried out."</p></blockquote>
The Government are criticised for giving modernisation grants and for not ensuring that they are used and implemented in accordance with the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a few words in criticism of another member state—Denmark. The Minister may be aware that for some years I have been arguing that one problem in the North Sea has been the effects of industrial fishing. It is principally the Danes who carry out such fishing. I was disappointed to read in paragraph (c) on page 86 of the Court of Auditor's report that the Danish industry received considerable modernisation grants. Those grants were supposed to move vessels from industrial fishing to fishing for human consumption. Paragraph (c) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"industrial fishing had been continued at the same rate as before, whereas, given that the period in question was characterised by a fall in fish meal and oil prices, the time seemed to be ripe for a genuine conversion of use."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
I wholeheartedly endorse that criticism. I hope that if the Minister gets the opportunity in discussions at the Council of Ministers, he will stress that there must be a major attempt to reduce the effect of industrial fishing in the North Sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have no argument with the idea that there should be proper accountability for public funds, that the money should be applied efficiently and that there should be value for money. I have been critical of modernisation grants. They were continued in this country at an inappropriate time, which has in _part led to the problem of overcapacity. The Government must take responsibility for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that the documents make it clear that people are eligible for modernisation grants if they intend to develop an under-utilised fishery resource. The Minister may be aware that applications have been made by some UK pelagic companies that wish to develop deep sea fishing off the west coast of Scotland. I understand that the French have benefited from quite large sums of money to develop that particular fishery. I know that some of our trawler companies have made applications. I do not know whether the Minister will be able to say whether those applications have been approved or whether the European Community has given any money to re-equip boats to enable them to pursue that sort of fishery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents provide a good overview of the various attempts that countries are making to reduce their effort and deal with the problem of overcapacity. There is a fair summary of the arguments for and against the different methods, and the advantages and disadvantages of decommissioning and other measures. One aspect, however, disappointed me. The Court of Auditors argues that future decommissioning should involve the destruction of boats, which has been an element in the UK decommissioning scheme. I see the logic of the argument. Other countries that have had decommissioning schemes have sold the boats to third countries, creating a potential for rivalry with other fishing fleets and failing to reduce capacity, as intended. I wonder how far that is due to poor planning, enforcement and implementation by the countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had discussions with organisations that are trying to develop third-world aid and would be keen to make use of surplus fishing boats. As the Minister knows, I have raised the matter before. The cost to our own fishing communities of disposing of boats must be taken into account in relation to the decommissioning money. Despite the problems that may have arisen in the case of other member states, I hope that in the Minister's talks at the Council of Ministers, consideration will be given to a properly organised scheme, possibly with the involvement of Goverment aid agencies, to use surplus vessels as part of an overseas development aid package, whereby they can be removed from European waters and safeguarded to ensure that they do not return. One way of ensuring that would be a strict and effective licensing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister drew attention to comments in the documents referring to decommissioning, the difficulty of implementation and the fact that on its own it was not the complete answer to problems of overcapacity. I do not dispute that, but the documents also contain fair comment about the problems associated with days-at-sea measures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
and the severe disadvantages that they entail. There are plus and minus factors connected with all the proposed measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents deal with sectoral management and to some extent regional management, although by that I do not mean the exclusion of fishing vessels that have historic rights in various regions of our country or other EC countries. When we discuss effort control linked with a decommissioning scheme, perhaps we should give more careful consideration to licence applications and conditions of licensing for particular, directed fisheries. I was interested to read, for example, about the problem of hake in the west coast area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, last night we discussed the significant proposed reduction in the hake catch in the western approaches. Our south-west-based fishing boats tend to fish for hake with gill nets. It is an extremely selective fishery, has a low discard rate and is conservation-minded, as it catches large fish. Some Spanish boats and flagged boats do not use gill nets for this fishery, which is one reason why hake stocks are under pressure. Has the Minister considered, as part of effort control, issuing licences for particular fisheries using particular sorts of gear? Those who use selective and conservation minded gear should be encouraged and supported, and perhaps steps should be taken against those who use gear that is clearly damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the problems of the register, and the Minister has given us some assurances about that. It would be wrong for this country to be penalised because we are trying to reduce our fleet of boats that do not fish in our own waters. That is another argument for a strict and effective licensing regime, so that we can have a clear idea of who is fishing where, how many boats are included and what they are catching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional aid is another important issue. I am glad that in discussing MAGP targets, the Commission recognises that if fishing fleets are being decommissioned, there must be an element of regional aid. I do not believe that in our discussions we have given enough consideration to the impact on communities and shore-based industries. I hope that the Minister will ensure that there is an adequate and effective regional aid package for the communities that will undoubtedly suffer when the fleet is reduced. Although we rightly argue for decommissioning, there is no doubt that it will affect jobs, and we must never lose sight of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criticisms of the Court of Auditors were fair in many cases. The reduction in capacity is not a simple issue and it must be carefully considered. The Minister challenged the fishing industry to suggest its alternatives to his proposals and the industry has done so. There are differences of opinion between various sectors, but the industry has made some workable suggestions. Those include issues, such as preserving and managing fish stocks, and improving the position of stocks that are at dangerously low levels. We must ensure that we restructure our fishing fleets and provide financial support under the decommissioning scheme. We must not bankrupt our fishing communities. In trying to achieve the important target that we in the Opposition support, we must ensure that people who have depended on fishing for their livelihoods are adequately rewarded in a structured, orderly way. We must ensure that our fishing fleets are of a size that they can operate without
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
undue restrictions and that our fish stocks remain at a sustainable level. We all share that target and the argument is about the best way of achieving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister had a setback in the recent court hearing. He now has the opportunity to suggest a more structured approach. The documents outline a range of measures. Some have advantages, while others have not, but they can all be carefully considered as part of a new approach to fisheries management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we cannot have a rerun of last night's debate, but inevitably some of the points that were raised then have already cropped up and will continue to do so in today's debate. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) for raising the vexed question of the hake total allowable catch and the dramatic decrease of 50 per cent. that is being proposed. That will have serious implications for fishermen in the south-west. The hon. Gentleman made a valid point about gill nets being much more selective in fishing than the methods used by the Spanish, in particular. That is a valid point that I heartily endorse. In drawing conclusions from that, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the important need to have much tighter management areas to safeguard the future of hake stocks. Instead of having a wide area, it should be broken down to areas such as 7a, 7f, 7g and so on. I trust that he will consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I praised the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe, but now I take issue with him to a slight degree. He was somewhat unfair to the Government in placing the whole blame for the failure to meet the United Kingdom's multi-annual guidance programme targets on the lack of a decommissioning scheme. He knows that my view on decommissioning is not too different from his, but I believe that there is another reason why we dramatically failed to reach our target and, again, it relates to the Spanish. I am sure that the Minister's predecessors were banking on the removal of ex-Spanish boats from our register under provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts in order to show a dramatic reduction in our fleet. They should not have been on the register in the first instance, and getting rid of them would have shown a reduction on paper. That was frustrated by the famous case in the European Court. As a result, a number of those vessels have come back on our register and have made the position of the United Kingdom much worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe is a fair man and must recognise the difficulties that my hon. Friend the Minister faces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Gentleman nods in agreement. Any Member from my party or that of the hon. Gentleman who had responsibility for the fishing interests of our country would have to deal with the problem that the targets are set, with all the difficulties to which I have alluded. Obviously, we are coming under increasing pressure from the Commission to make progress in reducing the capacity of the fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is how best we should go about achieving those targets. Again, I make common cause with the Opposition—I am not happy to do so—against the restrictions of days-at-sea regulations. I have always said
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
that there is a need to take painful decisions, even if days-at-sea restrictions do not go ahead. As I said last night, I do not believe that they will, but painful decisions must still be made about how to reduce our capacity. Of course, that problem faces other countries, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful for the various reports that we have because some of them show that although certain countries seem to be making progress in achieving reductions, it is questionable whether all have done so. That brings us back to the vexed questions; on which the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich focused, about the need for monitoring and enforcement, and how we satisfy our fishermen as best we can—to be honest, we never will—that other member states are taking reasonable steps both to control their fishing effort and to comply with European regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the rather narrow reference to the use of structural funds in the report of the Court of Auditors, we find plenty of examples of how member states have not stuck by the rules, even in handling cash transactions. If they are not doing that, they are certainly not acting properly in relation to other issues which concern all of us such as in implementing the conservation measures required by the Commission. The central weakness of the common fisheries policy is that unless there is an overall genuine attempt to stick to the rules, it will not work but will collapse. I welcome the Commission's control measures. They will help, even if taken belatedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my questions, it is important, not only in this matter but in many others, that Government Departments should be able to monitor what other member states are doing, not in precise detail but at least in general. That information would strengthen the hand of Ministers at Councils. Many member states—particularly those in the Mediterranean area—are happy to sign various directives or regulations because they know that they will not keep to them. Indeed, they often do not have the mechanisms to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on European Legislation was in Greece two weeks ago. We found that even income tax cannot be collected there. If income tax cannot be collected, how can the various EC regulations be kept that are so readily agreed to? That is so wrong. We need greater enforcement. We must be seen to enforce the rules and Ministers must be able to make checks. I serve warning not only on the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—the Ministry itself is not doing enough—but on other Departments that whenever I go to Europe and visit an embassy my first task will be to ask what it is doing to check how that member state is complying with the requirements of European legislation. That leads me to the main point about the Court of Auditors' report. One can pick out parts of the report, saying that this or that part is dreadful but, far worse, the report shows up the inconsistency of Community policy. The hon. Member for Glandford and Scunthorpe touched on that with respect to the United Kingdom. The Community and member states were busy shovelling out grants for modernisation and for increasing capacity, yet realised at the same time that overcapacity was a problem and that measures had to be taken to reduce it. That inconsistency has now been addressed—but so late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am an avid reader of 	<i>Fishing News.</i> [Hon. Members: "Aren't we all?"] Yes, particularly the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, who defends to the last the interests of her deep sea fishermen. 	<i>Fishing News</i> always gave great
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
prominence to the launching of new boats. I do not want to fall out with my good friend the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), but at one time the Shetland fleet was being expanded in the pelagic sector and huge new purse-seiners were coming down the slipways amid scenes of great rejoicing. That struck terror in me, because in those days—I am going back many years—the boats used to come down to the south-west and ruin the local mackerel stocks. It was a curious time: we were all blind to what was going on or, if we knew what was going on, we turned a blind eye to it. Ministers certainly did. We rapidly increased the capacity of the fleet, yet we were building up the problems that have now come home to us in a big way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Court of Auditors report shows, grants are still being made available in some countries that are sensitive to the problems of overfishing or that have a problem with overcapacity. We have not corrected the problem. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe made the tempting suggestion that we could make exceptions—that we could have some new purse-seiners, provided that there was a special need for them to fish off the west coast of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said referred not to matters such as purse-seining but to fishing for new deep-water species that require winches and deep-water gear. I should not want grants to be given for gear that could be used for general fishing, for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. Even so, there is a danger that if we make exceptions, we shall not know what such boats will eventually fish for. Even if they are given a limited licence—which frankly would not be economic for the boat owners—once they were built with the help of grants, the owners would say, "Ah well, can we do something else?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I had great sympathy for the case that the hon. Gentleman was making for decommissioned boats not to be scrapped but to be used as part of aid packages to distant waters. That sounds beguiling, but there are dangers, as he recognised. Such boats sometimes find their way back into the European fleet—not back into the United Kingdom fleet. I should not mind betting that some such boats would end up in the Greek fleet, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman address the question of converting decommissioned boats for other purposes? A yacht—as it was described—that was caught drug-running off my constituency was actually a converted trawler. Obviously, we are not suggesting that boats should be converted for that purpose, but is it not possible to convert boats for other useful purposes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman may want to rephrase that. I am sure that he was not suggesting that drug-running was a "useful" purpose. His proposal sounds attractive, but I suspect that there have been dodges, although not among the fishermen of his constituency or of mine, of course. Scrapping is the only fail-safe system. Otherwise, there could be loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful debate. Some hon. Members, who because of the way that last night's debate was structured were not then able to speak, have been given the opportunity to press the Minister further on all sorts of sensitive matters, especially decommissioning. The Minister must feel from time to time—probably every day—that he is under attack from those of us who represent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
fishing constituencies. May I assure him that most, if not all of us, appreciate the difficulties that any Minister would face when trying to resolve all the conflicting interests and maintain a sane policy, particularly when having to deal with other member states? Even if I am sometimes critical of him or of the Ministry, I recognise the deep difficulties that he faces. He is on a bed of nails.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee had a little mild amusement at my expense about the deep fishing that takes place in Crewe and Nantwich—presumably in Queen's Park. Crewe and Nantwich has a large number of consumers and, I am happy to say, fresh-fish shops to which we are hanging on like grim death. So we have direct involvement with developments in fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I do not maintain the gentle tones of his colleagues. I am concerned about the motion and I hope that I shall be forgiven for saying that it is extremely partial. It refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Court of Auditors criticism of Community expenditure on decommissioning".</p></blockquote>
However, it is clear from that extremely good report that the Court of Auditors has severe reservations, not only about decommissioning, but about the entire processes of decision making, about the adminsitration of existing rules and about the fact that many of the decisions have been put into operation not when they could have had an effect, but later. Decisions have been taken and money has been paid without sufficient and adequate information having been provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report's final observation makes it clear that although the Court of Auditors wholly accepts that the present imbalance between existing fishing capacities and available fish stocks makes it necessary for a structural policy to aim for capacity adjustment, it has grave reservations about the way in which the present system is working and about the total lack of clarity of what is being proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's attitude can be summed up in three Cs: confusion, chaos and, in some instances, collusion. I am deeply worried that the Government, in abandoning their existing plans for a days-at-sea scheme, which will not work, without making it clear, even to the House of Commons, that it is a permanent abandonment, are playing into the hands of those who do not want a properly monitored, controlled scheme to be established throughout the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Commission is not capable of monitoring the scheme. Quite rightly, it leaves responsibility for that in the hands of individual member states. I wholly approve of that; the problem is that the Commission does not ask for concrete evidence of what the member states are doing. Certainly, it does not follow enforcement of the scheme in detail, although it does so in relation to states that already have transparent methods. One of the more bizarre aspects of the entire agricultural policy is that although countries that have properly audited accounts and machinery, as we have in the House of Commons, for making Ministers responsible for the detailed financial control of taxpayers' money frequently
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
give full information, they are not provided with access to detailed information from other member states that do not comply with regulations at the same level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there will never be an active move towards decommissioning unless it is clear that any methods and policies agreed will be universally applied throughout the Community. There could be nothing worse than the British Government's accepting as a sort of bargain, a set of rules that were manifestly unworkable and which put British fishermen and, above all, British consumers in a worse position than they were beforehand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on European Legislation made it clear that it was worried by the political implications of the decision. The Court of Auditors report makes it plain that whatever the problems with the United Kingdom, many other fishing fleets are cheating. I do not know why we run away from the use of the word "cheating". Paragraph 3.35 on page 60 of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Projects receiving aid in Greece, Ireland and Portugal all have the benefit of the increased rate, whilst those located in sensitive regions of Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom also qualify. As a result, most of the aid is granted at the increased rate".</p></blockquote>
I could drive the Committee mildly mad by reading through the whole Court of Auditors report, but I shall not do so. However, it makes it clear that the policy is not working and that it cannot be enforced. Where it is enforced, it does enormous damage to our existing fishing fleet. In addition, it does not apply universally throughout the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the way in which the proposal is worded, the Government are failing to make it clear that they intend to protect the interests not only of the fishing fleets, but of the communities where those fleets are based—which, after all, should be considered paramount when such decisions are made. The Government are also failing to protect the interests of the British consumer. The proposal's wording is anodyne; it is not clear and it is not decisive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may consider that I am being unfair inasmuch as he has abandoned his unpopular regulations. The reality is, however, that even today the Government have not given us a clear undertaking that they do not intend to press ahead with such policies in the near future. They have a special responsibility to hold out against unworkable and unacceptable policies. There is no clarity of thought within the existing wording of the proposal put before the Committee today. As the Minister knows, when our debate has finished today, the proposal will not be reexamined in the same detail again. As a result, we shall experience the chaos that we experience on the Floor of the House when a general statement is made, and hon. Members cannot question it in detail as they can do in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Obviously, we want to conserve fish stocks, but, as she said, when other countries cheat, we cannot achieve our required aim. That happens not only in the fishing industry, but in other sectors. For example, the Spanish and Italians have been fined enormous sums because they have been cheating the milk quota system. Other countries cheat in other sectors. Some cheat in the fishing industry. We must ensure that countries play by the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Furthermore, such paucity of language coming from a Welshman pains me even more than it would do if it came from a mere Anglo Saxon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just one thing to say to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans). It is clear that, unless a hard line is taken by British Ministers in the Community, all the efforts of the Committee or individual Members of Parliament to discuss Community policies on the Floor of the House will be completely wasted. It is no good Ministers saying that they are playing by the rules while everyone else is cheating, unless they say that they intend to take certain measures unilaterally and impose on the community the necessity to respond to the views of the United Kingdom Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the short time that I have had responsibility for fishing matters, I have often been a hardliner. Does the hon. Lady agree that, in the negotiations that I am about to have this weekend, I can be as hard line as I like—I can thump the table—but that 11 other people may have differing views and may not support my line? We must always do what is best for the United Kingdom's interest, but at the same time we must recognise that, as decisions are based on qualified majority voting, just to be hard line say, "No" is not always the most desirable way in which to secure the best interests of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why I opposed qualified majority voting and why I continue to believe that it is unacceptable. I believe also that other Community countries that are faced with the same pressure from their nationals take unilateral action. If the Minister has not noticed that, I am surprised. That is how those countries proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, we have a direct resurgence of brucellosis from infected animals that have been imported from the continent. The disease affects people as well as animals. In such circumstances, the British Government would have the right to take direct unilateral action to prevent the importation of diseased animals, but they do not do so. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I know that the present Minister is not responsible, but his Ministry, faced with a specific case in which it could take unilateral action and in which it would be extremely difficult for the Commission to impose any sanction, has not taken such action. That would not be the case if France, particularly, but also Italy and the others were in the same situation. I was brought up by French nuns, who knew how to teach without ever raising then-voices. They brought into play everything, including hell fire, and it would be helpful if our Ministers understood the same bargaining techniques.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should not leave the Committee without giving a clear undertaking to the fishing industry that he will not proceed with the days-at-sea regulations or with decommissioning. He should be satisified, not that he has on paper a series of so-called agreements which may or may not be in our general interest, but that he has a 100 per cent assurance that enforcement will work. If not, he is failing in his duty to every person in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and Nantwich did well at the outset. I would not want to forget Nantwich, because, because I am sure that in Nantwich, as in Crewe, there are consumers of fish, as the hon. Lady pointed out. I often think that one element missing from our debates on the industry—perhaps the industry is never as acutely aware as it should be on this—is its need to market the product that it catches. However, in a year when the price paid to fishermen on the quayside for many species has slumped, that is not always reflected in the final cost to the consumer. Somewhere along the line some people seem to make money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did, in fact hear the Minister's comment, but it did not accord with what I had been told by fishermen.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the Minister has given a global figure for all species. It would be interesting to have a breakdown, but I am not asking him to give us one now. It might be worth a parliamentary question that I could table and he could duly answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a relative stranger to these proceedings—the only other time that I have attended, the Committee was also to discuss fisheries—I find it extremely worthwhile to have the question session, followed by a debate. Although we are not always satisfied with the answers that the Minister gives, I thank him for the courtesy with which he has dealt with the issues put to him. I am also pleased that, despite a procedural wobble, we have continued, as the general impression last night was that we did not have enough time to debate fisheries. It would have been regrettable if, under the guise of trying to disrupt the Government—which is not, in itself, an unworthy objective—the Labour party's tactics had upset the minority parties more. My honourable colleague the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) did not even get an opportunity to speak last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe spoke about regional aid. I recall that when submissions were made in the run-up to the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy last year, Cornwall county council put forward proposals that within the common fisheries policy there should be an element of structural aid for areas that would suffer as a result of the decline in the fishing fleet. That was a missed opportunity because as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, decommissioning means job losses. The decommissioning grant often goes to the owner of the vessel and there are not always provisions in place for others who will lose their jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission made proposals and I examined the matter carefully. There would be no additional benefit for Cornwall, because it benefits from 5b aid, so there would be no gain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point with regard to Cornwall, but there must be other fishing communities that will not necessarily qualify under any of the other categories of structural aid. Aid that was geared specifically to fishing communities would have been very worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) said that Britain overshot its multi-annual guidance programme targets and, rightly, drew attention to the significant element that vessels that fly the British flag may effectively be owned and operated outwith the United Kingdom. It has always struck me that for those vessels to have acquired a licence, a British skipper must have been involved. That may be a problem with the system of licensing that was introduced about eight or nine years ago. I remember some of us on this bench warned not specifically that licences might go abroad, but that they could become concentrated in one or two places, to the detriment of our coastal communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our arguments were accepted in yesterday's debate by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), as they apply to a tendency towards individual transferable quotas. The quotas could be transferred and end up in the hands of those who are based outwith the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe said about modernisation grants. There is no sense in having contradictory policies. However, there is a caveat: the ultimate package must have some scope for modernisation. Otherwise, our fleet will become ossified in the latter part of the 1980s, we shall not be competitive at the turn of the century if our fleet has not progressed. There is a fine art in dealing with this matter, so that we do not undo the gains that are being made in conservation. We cannot adopt the position that developments in fishing boats ceased circa 1989 or 1990.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to explain so that there is no mistake. I am not against modernisation grants per se, but they should be much more carefully directed—perhaps species directed, such as at the orange ruffe fishery, which is being developed and is under-utilised stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to fishing that takes place further afield—or should I say further asea—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the deep sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. The point that I was about to make to him has slipped my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decommissioning issue has taken up a considerable part of today's discussions. It is important to recognise that although the Minister and the Court of Auditors have expressed reservations, that device has been used by many of the other member states of the Community as an instrument to reduce their fleet capacity. The fact that we held off from decommissioning for so long means that we have a bigger gap to close, which will undoubtedly bring its own problems.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
Decommissioning can be an efficient and effective means of reducing fleet capacity. The remaining vessels in the fleet will have a bigger share of limited stocks. That makes the enterprise more viable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's point that the good achieved by reducing capacity must not be undone by increased effort. The point I wished to emphasise through the passage I quoted in Question Time is that it does not necessarily follow—the studies that I quoted suggested that it would be far from the case—that the remaining boats would increase their effort, thereby undoing the good done by decommissioning. When I receive the reports from the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers, I shall ensure that the Minister receives copies so that he and his officials can study them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that the Minister said that the Government thought that decommissioning had some effect and that they would not otherwise be spending £25 million of taxpayers' money on promoting a decommissioning scheme. I was also pleased that he confirmed that £25 million of taxpayers' money would be spent on decommissioning. That implies that we shall go beyond the first tranche. That concession from the Minister was welcome. I wish that he would come clean and be a little more upfront and open about the matter. He was unable to identify any single measure that he believed would be more effective than decommissioning—excluding his attachment to days-at-sea restrictions. Anyone who considers the situation seriously and who believes that we must try to meet the MAGP targets recognises that decommissioning must be part of the package. What can we conclude? It could be that the Minister wants the possibility of the suspension of decommissioning to act as a sort of threat against the industry during negotiations. Last night, he said that that was not his way of dealing with issues, and that he was not the sort of person to be vindictive or to issue threats. Therefore, the obverse side of the coin must be the case; he must be carrot-dangling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister would find that forthcoming negotiations with the industry proceeded more constructively if he made it clear that decommissioning would remain part of the package and if he stopped tip-toeing around the issue. He would not lose anything—much would be gained—if he said that decommissioniing was secure. The industry may want more and we could debate whether there is scope for more. He should at least say that what has already been promised will continue and then discuss the other measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night I said that the Minister was a little dismissive of the proposals put forward by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations. He was selective in his choice of proposals to criticise. I am sure that he recognises that a considerable amount of work went into the proposals; they concerned more than just measures relating to net sizes. The NFFO, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and many other organisations that he and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland have met have come forward with a wide range of measures which, by any estimate, provide a lengthy agenda for forthcoming discussions. I hope that he will make speedy progress with the discussions. If he is prepared to make guarantees on decommissioning, he may find that the badly needed atmosphere of constructive partnership will come more easily than he thinks will be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, Mr. Hill, you said that some of the questions were becoming rather repetitive. For most of us, the answers are becoming rather repetitive. The Minister was asked three times to say merely that decommissioning would be part of his future plans. He would say only that he was not ruling it out. Such evasion does not do the Minister any credit, and it adds to the uncertainty that the fishing industry faces. As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said, it adds unnecessarily to the uncertainty at this juncture. Given that decommissioning is one of the few items of fisheries policy on which, despite arguments about the scheme's scale and scope, there is consensus, one would expect the Minister to guarantee it as part of his plans. The detail, of course, might well be negotiated as time goes on. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the situation in his summing up and that he will give a reasonably firm indication that decommissioning is part of his continuing plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that decommissioning is important, particularly from a Scottish perspective, because it is a bit of history. It is well known in the Scottish industry that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland has been in favour of a decommissioning scheme since 1989 and that the Department was prevented from pursuing that policy by the Minister's predecessor. The latter and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were fiercely opposed to a decommissioning scheme. That opposition may have been partly dictated by that Minister's unpleasant experience in the early 1980s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scottish Office fishery Ministers won the opportunity from 1989 to argue for decommissioning, but the proposal was blocked by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in London. I detect a nod from the Minister as confirmation. Perhaps the Minister was nodding in a vacuum; nevertheless, we accept it as confirmation. In 1992, a compromise was produced. It was as much a compromise between the two Departments as it was a compromise between the Departments and the fishing industry. Decommissioning, favoured by the Scottish Office, was part of a package that included days-at-sea regulations, the latter being the brainchild of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The two were linked and made contingent on each other. That was extremely unsatisfactory because it meant that the one item that had consensus support from the industry was linked to something that was opposed by the industry north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Minister inherited a set of circumstances, so we should not blame him for the days-at-sea scheme. I know that it has caused him extraordinary hassle and worry—and embarrassment in court and in the Chamber. None the less, he should not say in a petty and vindictive fashion that he might withdraw decommissioning. He should take the opportunity of the court reversal to make a fresh start and to wipe the slate clean. He should establish that decommissioning will be part of the package and start constructive negotiations with the industry on what the other elements of the package might be. If not, the Minister will apparently be dangling a carrot before the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations south of the border. That is not the right atmosphere in which to embark on a series of fresh discussions and negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
I do not ask the Minister to commit himself to a particular scheme or even to a sum. I do not ask him to commit himself on the scope of the regulations or on the extent of the scheme. I merely ask for a positive confirmation that decommissioning will be part of his continuing plans for the industry and that he will start discussions with the industry on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather disappointed by the disparaging reference to part of the SFF's submission, which was presented to the Minister on 30th September and to which the SFF still awaits a reply. I refer to the 80 mm	<div class='sup'>2</div> <!-- sup --> mesh panel which is part of the SFF's thinking on the matter. The Minister felt that was a move backwards. That is not the case. The SFF wants a mandatory square mesh panel to be applied throughout the industry. If the Minister cares to look in the various Departmental files, he will find that the sea trials of the 80 mm	<div class='sup'>2</div> <!-- sup --> mesh panel showed that for the Scottish mixed fishery, such a square mesh panel was highly appropriate. A different size mesh might be required in other areas, but for the fish found in the Scottish sector of the North sea and elsewhere, the use of an 80 mm	<div class='sup'>2</div> <!-- sup --> mesh panel is backed by substantive evidence from the sea trials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will investigate that idea because Scottish Members believe that for a variety of reasons, the evidence from some of the sea trials was suppressed. Not all the evidence was put forward with the same vigour. Certainly the evidence was ignored, but I believe that it went further. It was inconvenient for the Departments to follow it up because they were embarking on a different series of measures and policies. The SFF can again present to the Minister the evidence about the encouraging escape rate of young fish through an 80 mm	<div class='sup'>2</div> <!-- sup --> mesh panel. The proposal has the industry's support. In his dealings with the industry, the Minister should remember that measures that have the support of the industry have a much better chance of being implemented than those imposed from elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the Spanish and Portuguese accession. Some of us were worried last night because the Minister's attitude seemed to border on the fatalistic. In his speech last night and in his answers today, he seemed to be assuming defeat in the Council meeting and to be preparing an alibi for an unsatisfactory settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we discussed the articles on which the legal advice of the Presidency document was based. The Minister showed slight irritation that we were haggling over that. I quoted from a letter of 29 November from the United Kingdom's permanent representative to the European Community. It disturbs me that there is still confusion about the articles on which the presidency document is based. It is more than a matter of detail because it is of enormous substance. The articles on which the presidency document is based dictate the scope of the adjustment of policy that the Spanish and Portuguese seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is conceded that matters other than a discussion about access to third-country stocks—a valid interpretation of the documents and articles—are at stake in next week's negotiations, the Minister will lose. To say to the industry that the outcome is better than the Commission's original document will be irrelevant. If the Minister agrees to proceed on the basis of a presidency document—a compromise—that allows increased access to any areas—the west coast or elsewhere—even under restrictions, he will have "selt the gemme", as we say north of the border. Once the Spanish have such access, any stocks—including restricted stocks—will be up for grabs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
because of the various devices being used by the Spanish fleet to circumvent existing regulations. Any access will lead to the same result that there would have been under the Commission's original unacceptable proposals, although there may be a different time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to allow for the fact that other people have been studying such matters in detail and are deeply concerned about them. I also urge him to re-read the papers to find out whether the United Kingdom's position is valid. I think that it is valid in legal terms and it has certainly been backed up by legal advice obtained by' the MEP for the Highlands and Islands. The debate should concern Spanish access to third-country waters and not to the waters of the previous 10 members of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, in his pursuit of days at sea, has effectively conceded the principle of the argument. There can be no argument for days-at-sea legislation unless it is based on the premise that once people have access to waters—even fishing for specific quotas for specific stocks—the situation is almost uncontrollable. The Minister has argued that the only way in which to control people is to keep them in port. Similarly, if Spanish access—even if it is restricted—is allowed, according to the Minister's arguments about days at sea, it will be impossible to control the depredations of Spanish boats. I urge the Minister to re-cast his position and to accept the well-founded legal position that the scope of the previous 10 members of the Community and their waters should not be negotiated at this stage in the development of the common fisheries policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting and wide ranging, and may have gone beyond the scope of the documents mentioned in our motion. Nevertheless, all the items were entirely relevant to the consideration of these important European Community fisheries matter. Many points have been raised, and I shall do my best in the remaining time to answer some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe drew our attention to the criticisms in the Court of Auditors report of the way in which various effort reduction targets had been achieved. Let me draw his attention to the fact that in the same period, Belgium, Greece, Ireland and Netherlands failed to meet their targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two wrongs do not make a right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but it should be put on record that we were not the only ones who failed. We had, for example, left market forces pressure on fishermen to see whether it would take some of the burden. We did not achieve our target, and we ended up making certain grants, to which the hon. Members for Glanford and Scunthorpe and for Crewe and Nantwich referred. In paying out money for modernisation, we effectively expanded the fishing effort of our fleet, as well as the number of vessels. We have all learnt from the Court of Auditors' criticism of modernisation and a simultaneous decommissioning scheme. The two cannot operate together, and we must learn from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was powerful in her criticism of enforcement measures in the Community. With respect, she does not do justice to the stance of the United Kingdom Government in trying to ensure full accountability not just in this case, but in many cases involving Community
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
expenditure. I welcome the fact that the Court of Auditors has closely examined these fishery matters, but we must remember that the documents refer to policies that were in place between 1987 and 1990. If there is one benefit from such analysis, it is that we learn from the criticism. In trying to achieve our multi-annual guidance programme target—member states were given the opportunity to devise their own methods for achieving those targets—we can learn the lessons of the Court of Auditors and of our own Public Accounts Committee, which has been as vehement in its criticism of previous policies as was the Court of Auditors. We can learn from those criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not trying to dodge questions about how we shall meet our Community obligations. That is why, in discussing effort reduction, I have emphasised the problem of a decommissioning scheme without some constraint on effort in the rest of the fleet. Whatever the analysis, we cannot dodge that issue. The Court of Auditors may examine other member states that have not combined decommissioning and effort reduction and it may issue another critical report, because that approach merely spreads out further fishing opportunities among existing boats. At least we had the courage of our convictions and tried to deal with the problem. The setback has been that our mechanism—days at sea—has gone to the European Court. That is why I welcome another opportunity to consider the matter. I have now dealt with the first two substantive points mentioned by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to discuss whether we could find a way in which to send decommissioned vessels to third-world countries. Under the present scheme, the order that the House approved requires that vessels should be scrapped for their owners to qualify for the money available. However, I want to be quite open with the hon. Gentleman, as I have asked the same question and come up with the same problems. How could we control a leakage back into the United Kingdom or the European fleet by vessels that had gone to third-world countries? In future schemes, I am prepared to consider the question of exports to third countries, provided that we can achieve safeguards against those vessels returning to European Community waters. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then mentioned industrial fishing, a matter that I take extremely seriously. I have pressed twice in the Fisheries Council for the matter to be considered. I wanted a scientific investigation into the operation of industrial fishing of multispecies. I wanted the species caught by that type of activity to be logged, and to monitor more closely the impact on the sand-eel population. I am pleased that we have made some progress and I am hopeful that at the Fisheries Council we may see a positive result showing that the Commission is prepared to do more work in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say again, in deference to the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, that I was a lonely voice at the previous Council in crying out for this work to be carried out. I cannot say that the Danes welcomed it with open arms, as I was probing into one of their fishing activities. I did not receive the support of other member states but, by dint of raising the matter twice and exerting pressure behind the scenes, we have a good prospect of getting it off the ground. Although it is a relatively small matter, it is important, and the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe was right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
to raise it. It shows the robustness with which we deal with these matters even when we are 11 to one down. I shall not comment on Crewe's football team at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe referred to hake stocks. The total allowable catch of this species that has been put before the Council represents a substantial reduction compared with the previous total allowable catch. If we compare the new TAC figure with the amount of hake that was caught, we see that the reduction is less onerous. I have talked to the scientists and I am convinced by their evidence. This was the first time that the hake stock was assessed, and we can argue for a larger total allowable catch of that species. However, the scientists have cautioned me that the pressure on the stock is such that if we overdo the fishing effort, something that is sustaining important fishing activity, especially in the western waters off our coasts, could be seriously at risk. However much we may chastise the scientists, it is important to recognise that we need some benchmarks to judge and consequently negotiate for different quantities offish. On this occasions, the scientists are advising me that following this firts assessment, I would have a sensible cast to argue for a larger quota, and that I shall do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe asked whether we could subdivide some of the existing areas so that hake stocks could be monitored more closely. Seductive though that argument may appear, there is the problem of accounting already for quotas within the existing areas. Blackfish was mentioned. I do not want to labour the point today, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will understand that subdividing would just increase the complexity and I do not think that it would answer the question. If there is a sufficient large TAC, everybody will have a sensible share. That is not something that I could negotiate at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hake divided into a northern and southern hake stock? Are not the Spanish trying to have those two stocks merged to suit their desire to develop track records? We should be wary about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There certainly is a north-south division. It is rather like the roundabout in Slough where it says, "To the North". It depends where one draws the line as to where is the north and the south divide. We are talking about the waters above the Bay of Biscay and of the Mediterranean. I am not aware of a Spanish plot to marry the stocks together, but I shall keep an eye open for it. At present, the northern and southern stocks are divided and are clearly distinctive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe talked about gear in the context of his remarks about hake. That takes us into the wider considerations of technical conservation measures. The Commission is deeply sceptical of those measures. It considers that anything to do with gear raises the question of on-board enforcement. Having said that, I do not shirk from the fact that it is an area to be revisited. It must be examined and discussed with the industry. I do not want to dismiss some of the excellent work that has been done. I realise that many of the fishing organisation found it hard to reach agreement among all their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not have the opportunity during last night's debate to go into the finest detail about why certain elements were wanting. I picked one or two and I apologise if selectivity was interupted as dismissiveness of those efforts—it was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
not meant in that way. I also recognise the point to which my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives drew my attention: there were other ideas in the proposals that went beyond the question of gear, such as closed areas, on which he is keen. I undertake to consider and discuss them with representatives of the industry. I met some to discuss TACs and quotas yesterday afternoon, when I said that I hoped that we should be able to gather to consider such proposals in the new year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to the Sea Fish Industry Authority's tank in Hull to see the different types of gear and I watched a videotape demonstrating the effectiveness of square-mesh panels. I am aware of the further work that is under way, conducting trials of such equipement at sea. Our scientists presented the industry with tables setting out the trade-off between effort reduction and mesh size for different types of fishery, but the use of such means was not proposed by the industry. There is room for more discussion, but the matter is complex and we should finally have to convince the Commission that technical measures could be counted against the MAGP targets. If the talks with the industry are fruitful, I shall face that issue. I do not dismiss the matter lightly—it provides an important basis for futher discussion with the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister for St. Ives speaks with passion and knowledge when representing his community's fishing interests. He mentioned hake, and I hope that I have dealt with that matter. He also mentioned matters connected with the fishing register and issues of tighter management. I have expressed in the debate my view that enforcement is the key to acceptability of much of the common fisheries policy. Unless we get that right, I cannot expect our fishermen to play by the rules. As the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich said, others sometimes look at the rules but play to a different agenda. The fishing register is a basis for our targets. My hon. Friend and other hon. Members have raised that matter and I shall consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked pertinent questions about intelligence. That was one of the early matters about which I asked when I took over my portfolio. It is right that we know what is going on in other Community countries. However, responsibility in that area lies with the Commission, which is why I raised that issue with the Commissioner. I shall continue to press that issue, and I shall take up my hon. Friend's point with our various legations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Minister for Glanford and Scunthorpe, for St. Ives and for Orkney and Shetland all mentioned aid to fishing-dependent communities. I draw their attention to the fact that, under the terms of Objective 2 status, fishing-dependent communities are listed as a separate item. I have pressed for the Commission to consider a list of nominations from the United Kingdom which includes fishing-dependent areas. The question of structural aid for local communities that are dependent upon fishing is not lost on me. I have pursued that as vigorously as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe talked about modernisation and referred to French vessels. That aid was for exploratory voyages. The Commission has dropped such provision from the aid package in its new structural regulations. The hon. Gentleman may not have been aware of that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich robustly chastised me for not being aware of the training programmes run by French nuns. I noted carefully her remarks. Like her, I am sceptical about what other countries are purporting to do but, to some extent, the nature of the MAGP target fulfillment, which gives member states the opportunity to work out their salvation, puts other member states on trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me full circle to the argument about why we have a Court of Auditors. Ultimately, it is the long stop. The auditors are the guys who ask whether countries have been playing by the rules. If they have not, those countries can end up by paying back large sums, a matter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) alluded. That is the right way to proceed. Such action places emphasis on the importance of playing by the rules, which is why I emphasised that a fishing vessel was fined £102,000 the day before yesterday and that its licence was confiscated for two years. That form of enforcement means something, which is why we shall continue to press that argument. I listened to the hon. Lady, and I shall try hard to be aware and streetwise during the course of such negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt satisfactorily with the issue of structural funds that was raised by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland. I turn now to his passing remarks about independent transferable quotas. In our response to the Select Committee, we made it clear that we did not favour such quotas but, that if the industry approached us about the matter, we would reconsider it. So far the path to my door remains unbeaten. I covered the hon. Gentleman's questions about modernisation grants in the context of my response to the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to shed a little more light on decommissioning, because I have been pressed to do so. I stated correctly, as I already had done, that the budget for our decommissioning scheme was £25 million. Opposition Members, in their enthusiasm to turn everything that I have said to their advantage, ignored the fact that we said that the money would be spent according to the original proposals—in three parts. We have spent £8·4 million on the scheme that was to run to the end of March this year. We have made no proposals about the remainder under our original ideas and they would not come into action until some time in the financial year 1994–95.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members create the impression that fishermen are sitting, waiting and wondering what will happen when, in fact, that will not be known until we have the opportunity of considering the results of the first scheme. Furthermore, we have to know whether there need to be adaptations in relation to the requirements for the second and third tranches. Then, at some point in 1994-95, we will make an announcement under the original proposals. As for timing for the industry, it loses nothing in respect of uncertainty while we reconsider the whole matter in the light of what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original proposals were introduced as part of an integrated package. Part of that package is in suspense while the European Court considers days at sea, and there is nothing wrong in my saying that we now need to consider in the light of the changed circumstances how we we shall achieve our effort reduction targets. I emphasise—I do not want the Committee to read anything more into my
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
remarks at this stage—that I am not willing to give an off-the-cuff answer about how we shall achieve that. I want to consider all the options that are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In yesterday's debate and in our question and answer session today, I said that I would announce our proposals in the new year when I have discussed the matter with the Commissioner and with the industry. Obviously, I have listened carefully to what people have said in support of decommissioning, but I do not want at this stage to go further in confirming our policy on effort reduction, until I have had the consultations that I feel that I should have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing that the Minister has said prevents him from saying that decommissioning is a continuing part of his plans. He merely raises suspicions here and in the industry by not confirming it. We do not wish to box him in, so that he has to give a precise timetable, a precise scheme or a sum of money; we merely ask him to confirm that it is a continuing part of his plans. Will he please do that now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I shall continue to think about those matters carefully in the context of all the other measures that deal with effort reduction. I made it clear that I rule none of those prospects out. However, in these changed circumstances, I and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food want time for those discussions and to come forward with our proposals. I understand the delicacy of the situation and the frictions and concerns put to me on behalf of the industry about our existing policies, but I want to move with caution, to take note of what hon. Ministers have said in this debate and other debates and to look at those remarks in the context of achieving our MAGP objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the sensitivities and the uncertainties. My constituency abuts on to that of Wyre, where fisherman of Fleetwood have had a difficult enough time, particularly because of the state of fish stocks in the Irish sea. In the nicest sense, I need no lectures about the matter, I consulted more than 70 fishing organisations during the summer recess. I listened carefully to what the industry had to say. I do not say that my knowledge is encylopaedic, but I got the message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to the matters raised by the honourable Member for Banff and Buchan. If I may, I offer him an apology during this plethora of detail. I quoted article 352, and I referred to the special arrangements vis-a-vis the Irish box, but I want to make it entirely clear that the discussion of the proposals on Spanish and Portugese accession will be based on article 162 which refers to Spain, and article 350, which refers to Portugal. I apologise if my slight inaccuracy on the two articles caused the hon. Gentleman to worry that we did not know what the basis was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that had it not been for the United Kingdom making a firm stand when that matter was first raised in Council, saying that we were not prepared to accept the Commission's original blank cheque proposal, we would not now be getting ready to negotiate alternative proposals—namely, the presidency compromise and, perhaps, other papers that we shall receive in Brussels. We were not prepared to sign up to the principle of free access to all Community waters by all Community vessels without there being the most meticulous scrutiny of the detail of what took the place of existing measures. I want to make it quite clear that we fought for that again at the latest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Fisheries Council meeting. This time, we have the support of other member states, We shall debate the outcome further this weekend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted that the Minister said that at the Council meeting this weekend he would be debating the presidency proposal and other papers that he might receive. Is it the Minister's intention to table any papers? I appreciate that, for negotiating reasons, he may not wish to give details, but is it his intention to put forward a United Kingdom proposal on how the subject could be addressed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have put forward clear criteria and said that whatever happens—bearing in mind that the Irish box must go in 1995—and whatever the changes, they must clearly reflect the principles of relative stability with no increase in fishing effort. We wait to see what proposals are put forward. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman respects my negotiating position. I do not want to leave anyone in doubt that both sides of the 4 degree line understand how important that particular issue is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attach equal weight to doing our best to secure the interests of the United Kingdom. I do not want anyone to misinterpret what I said yesterday as "preparing an alibi". I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and one of them said, "Mr. Jack, are you going to say no, no and no?" I said that I had already deployed one "no", but that the rest were dependent on what the other 11 people were doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in the debate yesterday, two parties are totally in favour of everything—Spain and Portugal. Greece, France and Italy are not wildly interested in the issue, the United Kingdom and Ireland are very worried about it and others are seeking to balance their fishing industries with the Community principles that are involved. We shall do our best to get the best agreements possible but, as I said yesterday, to do nothing is not an option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Salmond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not comment on the Minister's impression of a Scottish accent, which is probably just as well for him. Does he understand the point that I made? Is it possible to agree on a basis of legal advice that the matters covered, especially article 162 affecting Spain, do not justify a reinterpretation of access to the waters of the 10 members of the Community that Spain and Portugal joined? It can validly be argued that extra-Community, or third country, waters were at stake. Is the Minister aware of the possibilities in that legal argument and will he undertake to consider them before he goes into the Council meeting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have to give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking because I am now studying those matters, just as we did before we entered the initial discussions. That is why the legal base of the original Commission proposal was challenged. However, matters have moved on, The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
principal document that we are to consider is the presidency compromise and, as I said, other texts may come before us. The point is that the Community legal services were pressed on the questions of legal base and they were not found wanting in relation to the presidency compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the hon. Gentleman's arguments and they have been aired. However, the Community legal services have given their view and it was accepted by the Fisheries Council. Our own lawyers have considered that view and they do not dissent from it. As is always the case with matters of law, there will always be some, like the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan, who may have a different view, but that of the Communty legal services has been accepted by the Fisheries Council. The two articles that I mentioned are a proper basis on which to consider the presidency compromise. I do not have power to reopen that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can draw matters to a conclusion and that the Committee will see fit to approve the motion. I noted that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich criticised the motion, but there are many critical comments in the report, to which the hon. Lady rightly drew our attention, and the motion asks us to take note of them. I am sure that we shall all remember the points contained in the documents that she drew to our attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
