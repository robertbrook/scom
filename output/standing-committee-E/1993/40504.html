	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Roads and Traffic (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I start by saying what a pleasure it is to be in a Committee chaired by you, Dr. Blackburn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary aim of the proposal from the Commission is to harmonise the national weight and dimension limits of goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes and of buses with more than nine seats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission first made proposals on vehicle weights and dimensions in 1971. There followed a long period of discussion and debate. Revised proposals were produced in 1979 and in 1981. That finally led to the agreement, in December 1984, of directive 85/3/EEC, which set limits on some weights and dimensions—but only for the heaviest lorries that were used on international journeys between member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limits agreed were 40 tonnes on five or six axle vehicles for general haulage, with 44 tonnes for vehicles carrying containers on combined transport. In contrast to the current proposals, the combined transport vehicles can operate on five or six axles, but the tractive unit must have three axles. The provision for the three axle tractive unit was to ensure that the drive axle loads were kept as low as possible as it had not been possible to agree to specific drive axle limits. At that stage the United Kingdom secured the derogation to maintain our 38 tonne limit. Later, in 1986, the Council agreed on a drive axle limit of 11.5 tonnes for those vehicles. Again, the United Kingdom secured a derogation to limit axle loads to 10.5 tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The derogations were intended to give us time to assess and, and where necessary, to strengthen our road bridges, before accepting the increased weights. They allow us to keep our weight limits until 1999 and are maintained in the proposal from the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsequent amendments to the directive introduced weight limits for two, three and four axle vehicles; revised dimensions for the width of refrigerated vehicles; and revised length for articulated vehicles and drawbar combinations. The last amendment—in 1992—introduced a technical definition for road friendly suspension for the drive axles of some of the vehicles in the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To date, all the limits in the directive refer to vehicles that are used on international transport in the Union. The protracted discussion that has taken place since the early 1970s shows how difficult it is to harmonise the divergent standards that are applied in each member state. Following the completion of the internal market and the abolition of border controls in January 1993, however, the Commission now argues that widely differing national weight limits should be harmonised to facilitate equal competition in the internal market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The effect of the proposal for the United Kingdom would be to increase the maximum permitted weight of certain six axle vehicle combinations to 44 tonnes, to increase the width of non-refrigerated vehicles by 50 millimetres to 2.55 metres and to introduce a height limit of 4 metres. The Government response to that proposal is detailed in the explanatory memoranda—dated 24th February and 29th March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not accept the Commission's reasoning. The directive sets weight limits to allow the movement of goods vehicles and buses across all member states. For purely domestic journeys, there is no reason why a vehicle should not be loaded to different weights. Many vehicles that are limited to 38 tonnes in the United Kingdom can be safely loaded to 40, 44 or even 48 tonnes in those member states that allow such weights. More importantly, as we pointed out in the explanatory memorandum, a move to permit 44 tonne vehicles for general transport would completely undermine the measures that have been taken by the United Kingdom and other member states to encourage combined road and rail transport by allowing a higher weight limit. That would mean that, in terms of actual payload, combined transport would be at a disadvantage relative to pure road movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is not alone in opposing the Commission's proposal. The Netherlands and Denmark, which allow weights in excess of 44 tonnes, do not wish to impose burdens on their operators by restricting the weight at which they operate. Several Countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy, allow 44 tonnes for general transport on five axles and do not wish to force their industry to re-equip with sixaxled vehicles. Germany and France, like the United Kingdom, wish to encourage combined transport by allowing the additional payload of the 44 tonne vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also opposition from those countries which are seeking to join the Community. Sweden and Finland have sound economic arguments to retain their existing high limits of 60 tonnes on both weights and dimensions. Austria, however, wishes to restrict the use of road vehicles in favour of rail and combined transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limited discussion that has taken place on the proposal to date indicates that any agreement on weights is a long way off. The issue of dimensions is far less contentious. But, as we have stated in the explanatory memorandum, there would be significant problems with an overall height limit of 4 metres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complex and technical matter but I shall be delighted to do my best to explain the rather abstruse points to members of the Committee, should they so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a technical matter and I am sure that we shall all want some clarification from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask about the time scale. Is it correct that although the European Parliament originally wished to debate the issue before the pending European elections, it has now been deferred until well into the next Parliament? If so, can our derogation from 44 tonne lorries, which is valid until 1999, be renegotiated then on the grounds of subsidiarity? If so, presumably we still have the option to argue for subsidiarity across the board. The Minister has already said that, under the terms of subsidiarity Sweden will be able to retain its high limit of 60 tonnes when it joins the European Union, so on the same basis, is it possible for us to stay at our current level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is absolutely right about the time scale. The European Parliament will be well into its next session before it is ready to debate the issue. The Council of Ministers will wish to debate it too, and I foresee that it will run and run and because there is little agreement among Council members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise the genuine reason for derogation. We needed to strengthen our bridges and to carry out a survey of those bridges that might carry the vehicles. We are on target, but it is an expensive operation, although local authorities are co-operating valiantly with the Department of Transport. I have no reason to believe that the operation will not be completed by our target date of 1999, despite the inevitable financial and other difficulties that we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it would be possible to renegotiate derogation, we have no plans to do so on the grounds that the reason for derogation will no longer exist after 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady was arguing on the grounds of subsidiarity and policy, that is a different argument which I should like to think about further. The issue arises from the policy of encouraging more transport of heavy goods onto the railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend say more about the problems with height limits? Are double-decker buses the only category of vehicle to be adversely affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would have some difficulty with height limits. The height limit is 4.57 metres for a double-decker bus and 4.2 metres for lorries, but that applies only to vehicles running at more than 32.52 tonnes. The decimal figures are a result of the difference between metric and imperial measures. The intention was to prevent heavier lorries from becoming taller and that was the minimum height required to carry a standard 40 foot container on the lorries of that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people may think that the 4 metre vehicle height helps to overcome the problem of bridge bashing. I am not convinced about that. The real problem is the driver's lack of perception of the height of the bridge and his lack of knowldge of the height of the vehicle that he is driving. That is not as silly as it sounds. A driver may be used to driving vehicles with different trailers of different heights. As the average maximum height of our bridges is about 5 metres, there would be serious implications for double-decker buses that are higher than 4 metres.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations has my hon. Friend received from amenity groups and local authorities, and from road haulage and freight transport organisations? I imagine that there is a great divergence of opinion about the advisability of the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that we have received many representations. The Freight Transport Association has campaigned for a general increase in lorry weight to 44 tonnes on six axles because it recognises the advantages of six axles over five axles for road wear and for loading bridges, especially small ones. We are grateful to it for that. Its campaign included articles in the trade press and letters to Members of Parliament, which my hon. Friend and I, and no doubt you, Dr. Blackburn, have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities, environmental groups and many members of the public expressed concern at the proposed increase for combined transport, which they feared would open a back door to a general increase to 44 tonnes. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
was widespread opposition to that. Some local authorities were worried that there would be an increased incidence of damage to bridges. However, all those anxieties did not take into account the fact that an increase to 44 tonnes on six axles would not do more damage to roads or bridges than the present 38 tonne, five axle vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that there is still a perception among the electorate that a heavier lorry automatically means bigger dimensions. It does not, with the tiny exception of the increase in width of less than 2 inches, which was allowed for refrigerated vehicles because of insulation factors and because of the proposal in the directive which would allow for a slight width increase of about 2 inches to take account of new methods of stacking pallets inside containers. That would be much more efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present regulations take account adequately, and largely without complaint, or occasional overhang loads that are carefully regulated. Therefore, I do not think that the anxiety is as great as it was. That is a summary of the responses to the consultation on the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that five different attitudes had been adopted by 11 different nations, including some of those which had applied for membership of the Community. Is it therefore likely that the Commissions initiative will be taken on by the presidency, which will work out a presidential compromise between the different viewpoints?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is likely, but I think that it will be years before the matter is resolved. Britain's argument is that these are issues of subsidiarity and that we manage perfectly well now. I have already explained that a vehicle that is allowed to load to only 38 tonnes in this country can safely load to 44 tonnes or more in countries in which it is allowed to do so. That introduces the issue of cabotage, to which hon. Members may wish to refer. As we already work perfectly well with different lorry weights, and as operators and drivers are used to that and it causes little trouble, I suspect that the argument on subsidiarity will win the day—I certainly hope so, because that is what we all want to achieve. That is particularly important because we are dealing not so much with a technical argument as with an argument of policy. We are trying to get more appropriate freight on to railways in a number of different ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the economic implications of this measure with regard to the strengthening of bridges. Would the increase to 44 tonnes have any adverse effect on the Eurotunnel or on the ferries betweeen Scotland and Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland, the directive is not intended to apply to Northern Ireland. However, the Northern Ireland Office is considering making separate proposals and that will be a matter for my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Freight transport through the channel tunnel is important. We anticipate that the 44 tonne limit for combined transport will be very popular with operators who want to route long-distance freight through the tunnel. There will be no change for ferries. We thought carefully about whether we should include the 44 tonne limit for ports and, on balance, decided against that. It was not an easy decision. We reckoned that containers going to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
international destinations by sea would continue to reach the port by rail. If we allowed 44 tonne lorries to travel from the freight depot at Folkestone straight through the channel tunnel it would increase the number of 44 tonners on the roads through Kent, so we have said that they will have to load on to the train at the Willesden depot. That is the present position, but it may change with the Ashford interchange. There will be no change for shipping: 38 tonners are allowed to go to ports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return my hon. Friend's attention to the fear of a general increase to 44 tonnes, which would have a detrimental effect on our integrated road and rail transport policy. Have any calculations been made of the amount of freight that could switch from rail to road? If so, can he tell us about that, because it is of great interest to the Government and to the Opposition, who support a combined rail and road transport policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By raising those points my hon. Friend shows how perceptive she is. One of the most extraordinary things about the Commission's proposed directive is that at no point—not even when it refers to combined rail and road transport—does it mention railways. It appears that the Commission has totally ignored rail transport. May I draw the Committee's attention to the proposal for a Council directive, which is in the document dated 15th December? Paragraph B.I(e) on page 3–1 believe that I am not allowed to quote in French so I will translate it—asks about the positive effects of the proposal. It then states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The positive effects of the proposal will be threefold. Firstly, it will simplify the possibilities for cabotage".</p></blockquote>
Secondly—I paraphrase—it will specify road-friendly suspensions and, thirdly, since the maximum weight would be increased in seven member states, the proposal would result in fewer road journeys. It does not mention railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked me about figures. The latest statistics that I can offer are as follows: in 1992, of the 94,800 articulated tractor units registered in Great Britain, 27,300 were three axled vehicles; and of the 240,000 trailer units on the road that year, only 75,600 were three axled. The majority of existing six axled articulated vehicles would be able to operate at up to 42 tonnes without modification but, were they to take full advantage of the proposed increased weight limits, the use of specially adapted semi-trailers would be necessary because of our restrictions on axle spacing and loading. That is another technical difference between us and the Commission. The axle spacing of the trailers is crucial, especially for short-span bridges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The estimated additional cost of a semi-trailer capable of operating at the new weight is between £2,000 and £3,000. An adaption of existing semi-trailers is possible but at a cost of between £3,500 and £4,500 each. Special designs would not be required for drawbar vehicles but relatively few existing vehicles are capable of operating at 44 tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, less than a third of present tractor units would be able to take advantage of the proposed weight increase and approximately one third of existing trailer units would be able to operate at up to 42 tonnes but not at 44 tonnes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are important details because we are considering the extent to which there will be any saving in the total number of lorries on the road as a result of the increase to 44 tonnes. That is difficult to quantify. In so far as present cargoes are restrained by weight, an increased payload
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
would, theoretically, reduce the number of lorries for a given amount of freight. Many cargoes on the roads are already constrained by volume. In such cases, no advantage could be taken of a higher payload. It is all very well to talk about 44 tonnes but, if a lightweight commodity such as boxed kitchen chairs is being carried, the load will not add up to anything approaching the maximum weight allowed—nor would feather pillows. Volume is important in both of those examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Present estimates indicate that between 4,000 and 5,000 lorries might be saved by a general weight increase to 44 tonnes, but that saving takes no account of the risk to the viability of the rail freight market. That would be significant, especially for intermodal traffic where road and rail are in direct competition. Again, that is difficult to quantify but the effect on rail container-carrying operations could be substantial and might offset the number of lorries saved by as much as 50 per cent. That would not be compatible with the Government's objective of maximising the use of rail for freight movements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your reply in English, Minister, was most acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to an earlier point and ask about the bridge-strengthening programme. The Minister commented on the public's fear that, as we have gone from 38 tonnes to 40 tonnes to 44 tonnes, we might increase to 60 tonnes. Can he tell us how such work has been done if money has not been allocated to ensure that the programme has been carried out consistently? I want to stress the absolute importance of having designated routes for heavy lorries. Because of our failure to have a routeing policy, is not there a real fear that, although we have been putting much money into the bridge-strengthening programme, we have no control over the route taken by 44 tonne lorries travelling to rail freight terminals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to address those important points. On lorry weights and bridges, we have already taken account of the bridge-strengthening operation. That is important because the stress on bridges relates primarily to axle weight, but it is also important that the load distribution on bridges is acceptable. That is why I said that short-span bridges pose a special problem. It is important that the spacing between axles is controlled because such bridges are more common. United Kingdom regulations include detailed axle-spacing requirements, but they are not all covered by the Commission's proposal. In particular, there is no Commission requirement for a minimum space between the last axle of the tractor and the first axle of the semi-trailer in an articulated lorry. That is an important factor. On longer-span bridges, the total weight of the vehicle is more important, but we have a lot of shorter-span bridges, such as those that cross railway lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until our programmes of bridge assessment and strengthening is complete, we cannot allow axle weights greater than 10.5 tonnes. Good progress is being made with trunk road structures. Spending of nearly £50 million is planned this year and we are confident that the job will be finished by January 1999. All costs incurred by local authorities when assessing and strengthening bridges carrying local authority roads are eligible for transport supplementary grant. Resources allocated to local authorities in the past few settlements have remained constant at £137 million, despite reductions in other expenditure categories this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
It is true that we have made comparatively little progress on privately owned bridges carrying local authority roads, such as those owned by British Rail—now Railtrack. Funds for assessment are being channelled through the local authorities, giving them a greater say over their local priorities. It is in the interests of local authorities to complete the scheme. Otherwise, they will find that heavier 44 tonne lorries will not be able to use those bridges in 1999 and they will have to be diverted on to less suitable roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a question about lorry routes. Local authorities already have powers to ban certain classes of vehicles from sensitive roads. A general ban would cause many major problems for access and enforcement and might give rise to the need for trans-shipment in one form or another. However, the siting of railheads and goods depots would make such a general restriction on 44 tonne lorries for combined transport impossible. Good road access to the terminals is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State also has powers under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to prohibit or restrict the use of specified sections of motorways and trunk roads by certain classes of vehicle. The same legislation gives local highway authorities the power to restrict or prohibit certain classes of vehicle from using certain stretches of road where there are clear reasons for doing so. That Act also gives authorities the power to specify through-routes for lorries, or to prohibit or restrict their use on certain roads or within zones, to preserve or enhance the amenity of an area. Both those provisions are subject to procedures requiring public notice to be given. In some cases, a public inquiry may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) will agree that the 1984 Act contains significant powers. A national lorry-routeing system would be very difficult to devise and enforce, because many heavy goods vehicles will be destined for places outside the route, such as particular factories or locations. Is the hon. Lady suggesting that a massive new bureaucracy is needed to permit vehicles to deviate from specified routes? That would be a nightmare and enforcement would be very difficult and expensive for all concerned. I am not convinced that we need a national system of lorry routes. I would prefer to work to encourage combined road-rail traffic and to get appropriate freight traffic off roads and on to rail where possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to return to the question of height limits. My hon. Friend identified the reservations of a number of other European Community countries about proposed weight limits. Do those reservations extend to height limits? Britain is the only European country that has double-decker buses; since it is therefore our interests alone that are at stake, has he received a sympathetic hearing from the Commission and from other member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are getting a very sympathetic hearing on the question of height limits and several other member states are concerned about the 4 metre height limit. I do not know why that limit for bridges was thought appropriate, but it poses no threat to the British double-decker bus. I can, however, understand my hon. Friend's anxiety about that; after all, we already have incidences of double-decker buses getting stuck under bridges—but that is a rare occurrence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, Stoke-on-Trent is a very special place, so I am not surprised by that. There is no threat to our double-decker buses and that is another reason why we should seek subsidiarity on the issue from the Commission. I hope we can convince them of the need for that. I believe that we will, because there are so many other nations that agree with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the implications of heavier loads for road accidents? Is it worse to be squashed by a 44 tonne load or a 40 tonne load? Have studies on that been carried out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the increased weight limits will have no effect on performance, because the same stopping distances must be achievable with heavier weights. There should therefore be no safety risks, even on matters such as that of mirrors, where we have introduced changes; we are seeking further changes at a European-wide level on mirrors to ensure that blind spots both backwards and downwards on the near side do not occur. As far as accidents are concerned, the vehicle inspectorate is very anxious to enforce the regulations and it is important that we pay tribute to the extraordinary work it undertakes. For example, it anticipates examining a minimum of 1.4 million heavy goods vehicles and 145,000 public service vehicle tachograph charts this year; it will also weigh a minimum of 115,000 goods vehicles and have at least 90 per cent. weighbridge equipment available nationally at any one time. Enforcement is a very serious issue and it is working. That is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister square his claim that enforcement is working with his proposals for continuous operator licences and with the changes that will affect the traffic commissioners? Will he ensure that reputable people operate those 44 tonne lorries? I think we have problems with enforcement and I would like the Minister to give us more detailed information about how he will deal with matters relating to safety, to pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East. Can he also give us more detail about the London lorry ban and the proposal of the Minister of Transport in London to change the arrangements for that ban? How does he intend to ensure that proper enforcement is achieved and that those lorries are confined to routes to the rail freight terminals that he mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am allowed to depart from the subject matter of our debate, I shall answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no change in the standard of enforcement of continuous operator licensing. To suppose that is to miss the point. The traffic commissioners will have exactly the same powers: the proposed change will simply cut down bureaucracy. I know that the hon. Lady and her party have argued against that change—it is merely a facet of the difference between us—but there is no evidence or reason to suppose that there will be any diminution of standards of inspection or performance by operators as a result. The same is true of the London lorry ban. The passage of vehicles through the City has not changed—the only change is in the number of bits of paper that are generated to operate that ban.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I met the traffic commissioners last week and I have the highest regard for them. I wish that more people knew about their work. Changes have been proposed regarding their work, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is considering changes to the organisation of the traffic area offices, which interact with the vehicle inspectorate in an important way. We are still considering those important matters. Safety—for other road users and for the industry—must however, come first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is being done to encourage the noble idea of combined road and rail transport? Does any research show what inter-connections can be made between road and rail transport faculties to enable quick loading and transfer from lorry to rail? Could all freight points be used to enable that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to explain what this argument is about and invite members of the Committee to consider it from a different perspective? Instead of thinking about a lorry, we should think about a container, because the issue is all about the comparative weights of containers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard international 40 foot container has a maximum payload of 30 tonnes. The maximum contents would be 25 to 26 tonnes of freight, because the container weighs 4 tonnes. Given the 38 tonne limit, a full load cannot be put in such a container and be carried on a road on a 38 tonner. That can only be achieved if an extra 6 tonnes is allowed for the total weight of the tractor, trailer and container. An extra 6 tonnes, not five, must be allowed for, because 1 tonne must be allowed for the axle. If a vehicle that goes to the railhead has the advantage of those few tonnes, it will have the same payload as a container on a train. If we continue with the 38 tonne limit, we shall give an unfair competitive advantage to a container that is taken by road, That is what we seek to eliminate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to encourage hauliers to apply for licences to replate their vehicles up to the 44 tonne limit for combined operations. Since the regulations came into force on 24 March, we have had more than 100 applications from the freight transport industry to do that. That will mean that companies in the industry will be at an advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we see lorries thundering down the road, carrying freight that we might think should have been carried by train—such as aggregate for road-building—we should bear in mind the fact that the industry can already operate so efficiently with 38 tonners that it can undercut rail transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East is right to say that, unless there are proper interchange facilities between road and rail to make the transfer of container loads quick, we shall not reap the advantages that we envisage. That is why the Government have invested large sums of taxpayers' money in the Eurotunnel terminals around the country. They will be efficient and have been designed to allow the swift transfer of goods from road to rail, as the hon. Gentleman wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say how much freight has been lost in the past five years from rail to road? There has been a large move in that direction in freight in cement, chemicals and cider. What investment has been made in the railways given that current technology permits piggybacks and the kangaroo methods to which the Minister referred?
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
He referred also to new depots for the channel tunnel, but there is no evidence that rail terminals around the country can accomodate a return to rail freight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to bear in mind the range of questions asked by the hon. Lady, despite the faulty memory that comes with the onset of old age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to quantify rail-to-road losses. My Department's economists estimated that the direct effect on train-load freight in the United Kingdom could be equivalent to 50 million additional lorry miles. The effect on container-carrying operations could also be severe, with a large proportion of existing traffic lost to road. Whatever the numbers, the effect on freight rail is likely to be damaging. In mainland Europe, 44 tonne lorries operating internationally are likely to pose a considerably greater competitive threat to freight rail than the present 40 tonne vehicle. That does not sit well the European Community's oft-declared aim of encouraging combined transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are limiting the measure to lorries carrying containers and swap bodies and not applying it to semitrailers carried piggy back on railway wagons. Road-rail operations are likely to be confined to the carriage of such units. Whole vehicles cannot be carried by rail in the United Kingdom at the moment. Semi-trailers carried piggy back do not suffer from the 4 to 5-tonne payload disadvantage applicable to vehicles carrying containers and swap bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have to hand details of the amount of investment made in freight terminals, but that information is easy to obtain and I shall give it to members of the Committee in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister replied to my earlier question, he gave the impression that the directive will not apply to Northern Ireland. That is difficult to understand. If it is accepted, will it not apply to the whole of the United Kingdom and not simply to Great Britain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it will apply to the whole of the United Kingdom—but I understand that the Northern Ireland Office is involved in separate consultations with the industry in the Province, to assess the directive's effects there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A possibly far-fetched scientific solution to the road-rail link problem would be a technology that would turn lorries into wagons and wagons into lorries. Such a solution would help to ensure that rail was fully utilised. The idea is not science fiction, as developments along those lines are currently under way in America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question concerns subsidiarity, to which the Minister referred. Does the case for subsidiarity depend on the nature of the road and transport system in this country, or on the state of the vehicles that operate here? I understand some of the subsidiarity arguments, but a great deal of coordination is needed to develop the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is, disappointingly, a mixture. As I have said, different countries have different reasons for objecting to the proposals. In Italy, for example, 44 tonne vehicles have five axles only. We believe that that is not justifiable in terms of wear to the road. The proposal also has implications for transport policy in view of the fact that we are trying to integrate road and rail to a greater extent. Countries with high limits, such as Sweden where it is 60 tonnes, do not want to force their industries to reduce that limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The health of the freight industry is an important matter of public policy. Of course, how regularly operators and owners of freight vehicles, wish to purchase new vehicles that are built to different standards, or whether they wish to adapt existing vehicles, which can be very expensive, is a matter of commercial judgment for them. A vehicle can be adapted by putting a steering bogey on a third axle of a trailer, which can then carry the 44 tonne limit. That is expensive and complicated, however, and cannot be done to all makes of trailer. Thus there is a mixture of motives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the draft proposal emerged as recently as last December with no prior notice to member states. The transport working group has since discussed it twice and the proposal to harmonise national weight limits at 44 tonnes on six axles was generally criticised. The Commission might consider amending at least that aspect of it. The proposal has also been discussed in Committee in the European Parliament. We understand that the weight element was criticised, but, as I said, a formal response is unlikely in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether members of the Committee saw the original consultation document, which was issued by the Department of Transport in February 1993. Perhaps I may circulate copies of it. It has pretty pictures inside, which illustrate the points made by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East about different types of vehicle. He was right to say that in an ideal world we would have containers that were road vehicles but could be put on trains; that is effectively what swapbodies are. The document illustrates the difficulties that we face as a result of different configurations of road freight vehicles. Would it be for the convenience of the Committee to hand that document round?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No it would not, but the Minister may leave copies of it on the Table for hon. Members to take if they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely what research has been carried out on the safety aspects of 44 tonne vehicles by the transport research laboratory which, the Government are in the process of privatising and fragmenting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Between 1988 to 1990, the transport research laboratory carried out research, which revealed that vehicle maintenance defects caused about 7 per cent. of all accidents in the freight category. I do not have details of further research to hand, but I should be happy to include them in the letter that I propose to send to members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier this year, in a series of parliamentary questions to the Minister, I asked whether the Government had any forecasts of projected traffic growth for 44 tonne lorries, in the event that they went ahead with their proposal to allow such lorries on domestic routes. The Government have already done that, in advance of the European directive which relates to all journeys and not just to journeys to and from railheads. In the light of what the Minister has just said, has he any more information about traffic forecasts? After all he has already told us what changes have taken place since the new regulations had come into effect. Although we prayed against those regulations, we had no opportunity to object to them in Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an earlier answer I explained the changes that we anticipated and why we think that the Commission has got its arithmetic wrong on this issue. We have no forecasts in the form that the hon. Lady suggested, for the simple reason that we are not proposing a general increase to 44 tonne vehicles; the proposal applies only to the restricted category of road and rail combinations. A I said, since the regulations were introduced on 24 March more than 100 firms have applied. It will be up to individual operators to decide whether they wish to change over and it is impossible to forecast what market decisions they will take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we move on to the debate on the motion it will be for the convenience of the Committee to know that I have selected the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North. I shall call the hon. Lady to move it after the Minister has moved his motion and if she catches my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.21 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 11504/93 relating to weights and dimensions of vehicles; whilst supporting the proposal to consolidate the existing legislation, questions on grounds of subsidiarity the harmonisation of maximum lorry weights for national journeys; and considers that the proposed general weight limit of 44 tonnes for 6-axle vehicles conflicts with Community and United Kingdom policy intended to encourage combined road/rail transport for environmental reasons.</p></blockquote>
It might be helpful to the Committee if I briefly rehearse some of the arguments that we have discussed and stress the Government's position. The Government have mixed views on the proposal from the EC Commission for a new directive on vehicle weights and dimensions. The consolidation of the existing amended directive 85/3 is useful. On vehicle dimensions, and the proposal to harmonise them for national as well as international transport, we are hopeful that there will be no insuperable problem. We are optimistic about securing the clarification that we are looking for in certain places in the Commission's draft. But on vehicle weights—and of course we are essentially concerned with the maximum weights for the largest categories of lorry—we have serious misgivings about the Commission proposals. I sense from the questions posed by the hon. Members that they share those misgivings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three reasons why we find the Commission's proposals regarding maximum weights hard to accept. First, we see no reason why lorry weight limits for purely national, domestic journeys need to be consistent throughout the Community. Member states should be able to set their own rules to suit their own circumstances. Lorries designed for operation at higher weights in one member state can be used at lower weights in others simply by carrying less. The Commission's argument that harmonisation is necessary to ensure fair play in cabotage is a red herring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the Commission proposals seem to fly in the face of all that the Community has been trying to do in recent years to promote the use of rail and promote combined transport—journeys by combination of road and rail. There is recognition that the unbridled growth of road transport is not an option for the future. Of course, for many journeys for which goods have to be conveyed there is no sensible alternative to road transport. But for longer distance journeys, or for large flows of goods conveyed in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
bulk over comparatively short distances, alternatives to road transport need to be developed if the Community's trade is not to be gummed up in ever growing traffic congestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Britain, we have taken a recent lead in measures to encourage more freight on to the railway. Among them are regulations to allow 44 tonne lorries for combined transport, so that lorries carrying containers or swapbodies, which make most of their journey by rail, are able to carry roughly the same weight of goods as can be loaded into an articulated semi-trailer making the entire journey by road. If the maximum weight of lorries were to be increased to 44 tonnes for general road haulage, that would entirely negate the impact of our special weight concession for combined transport. It would also give a competitive boost to road transport in the bulk freight markets, such as aggregages, coal and steel. That would inevitably take traffic away from the railways in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, which is the opposite of what we, and I think most other member states, want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the 44 tonne vehicles that the Commission's proposals would oblige us to accept on our roads are not the same as the 44 tonne vehicles that we now allow on our roads for combined transport. The Commission's proposals would allow a maximum weight of 11.5 tonnes on the drive axle. Our present limit is 10.5 tonnes until January 1999, so that we can check and strengthen our bridges where necessary. The "Commission vehicle" would impose more wear on our roads than the 44 tonners that we have been prepared to allow. Those are the reasons why the Government questioned the Commission's proposals on weights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I emphasise that the United Kingdom is not alone in its resistance to the Commission's proposals on weights. A majority of other member states also indicated opposition. I hope that the Committee will support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.25 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, in line 4, leave out from 'journeys;' to end and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'deeply regrets that in the case of the United Kingdom there is no co-ordinated policy on routing of heavy goods vehicles nor sufficient investment in combined intermodal transport on rail networks; considers that any increase which allows 44 tonne lorries on British roads should be resisted; and calls on the Government to pursue this view in the Council of Ministers.'.</p></blockquote>
We oppose an increase to 44 tonnes. Labour's transport spokesperson in the European Parliament, Brian Simpson, has already attacked the European Commission's move to increase the maximum weight of lorries allowed on Europe's roads to 44 tonnes. In the European Parliament he described the move as an "environmental and ecological disaster" and accused the Commission of total surrender to the road haulage lobby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the proposal flies in the face of European Community transport policy, which aims to promote rail transportation. If present trends continue, the volume of freight carried by heavy goods vehicles is forecast to treble by 2025. Therefore, we must have a proper, integrated transport system to deal with such issues. The thought of 44 tonne juggernauts thundering through the British countryside—whether it be Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire or Northern Ireland—fills me with utter horror.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
We must do everything that we can to make this an issue of subsidiarity. If our current transportation structure does not allow for 44 tonne lorries, which I do not think that it does, we must make a stance now and do all that is possible to resist the pressure for such lorries. The proposal is a retrograde step and would be an environmental and ecological disaster. Given the Government's current road-building programme—such as it is—there are enough such disasters without having to contemplate the possibility of more. Labour Members of the European Parliament have already notified the Commission that the proposal will be fought tooth and nail at every opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased with the Minister's comments about the Government's opposition to the proposals involving 44 tonne lorries on our roads. I hope that any decision is agreed not only by the Department of Transport, but by the Department of Trade and Industry. We have read the document, "Deregulation Task Forces Proposals for Reform" and have heard much from the Minister about cutting red tape. The DTI's proposal—published in January 1994—included issues such as continuous operator licences and the London lorry ban, which I have mentioned already. It also proposed the use of 44 tonne lorries on domestic journeys in this country. I am glad that the Department of Transport, through a press notice or a parliamentary question, said that it would not accept this proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what the Department of Transport says about transport policy goes, and that this is not yet one more instance of bickering in the Cabinet, with the DTI overriding the Department of Transport. If that is the case there could well be an open door, allowing us to go from 38 tonnes to 40 tonnes, from 40 tonnes to 42 tonnes and from 42 tonnes to 44 tonnes. After that, who knows? The weight could go higher—perhaps allowing even bigger double-decker buses—up to the 60 tonne limit that is permitted, for different reasons, in Sweden. It is a question of subsidiarity, and the Government must fight for it at every opportunity in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on telling the Committee that he wants to promote rail and combined transport, but there are other matters to worry about. We cannot debate lorry weights and dimensions in isolation. The DTI's apparent desire to dictate policy was mentioned, but the matter must be kept under constant review. Heavier lorries must be resisted, even though pressure for them is exerted by the DTI or the Treasury. We have a derogation until 1999 in respect of increasing lorry weights. Under no circumstances can we accept bigger or heavier lorries when we have no integrated transport system or designated lorry routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the Minister. Only one conclusion can be drawn from the London lorry ban and the current deregulation—that although the mechanics of the lorry ban remain, the removal of the means to enforce it means that Londoners will see heavier lorries thundering through their streets. There will be no way to enforce the ban properly. I do not accept the Minister's assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same problem of lack of control will affect the movement to and from rail terminals of 44 tonne lorries. The Minister must return with specific proposals for routing, to be carried out in partnership with local authorities. People in this country do not want heavy lorries thundering through towns, cities and the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
There must be adequate investment in the rail network and in trans-shipment depots, including facilities for containerisation, trailer piggy back transfers and the transfer of goods from rail to smaller vehicles. There must be adequate land use planning procedures. The Department of the Environment has made some progress over local planning decisions, but the same planning control and land use procedures do not exist in relation to the roads programme, of which there has yet to be a proper review. Roads are being built, motorways are being widened and traffic is being increased—but the switch to rail is not happening. The move to deregulation and to continuous operator licensing will make matters worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment in research into efficiency, safety and environmental protection is being cut. Unless the Government can be dissuaded, they will go ahead and privatise the transport research laboratory, with the result that the research information that has been gathered will be fragmented. Alternative options are available. The Minister made some good points today about what is needed, but I hope that he will act to persuade the Secretary of State for Transport to think again about the privatisation of the transport research laboratory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was stated in the document "Moving Britain into the 1990s", for environmental reasons we intend to take every opportunity to resist the move to 44 tonne lorries. There must be a proper transport strategy. For reasons of subsidiarity, there must be built-in safeguards as regards routing and investment in inter-modal transportation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must take a further relevant point, especially since there has been no opportunity to debate either in Committee or on the Floor of the House our prayer earlier in the year against the statutory instrument that has now come into force. We are unhappy about the introduction of 44 tonne lorries on domestic journeys because there is no economic argument to favour bigger lorries, and there is evidence that bigger lorries do not mean fewer lorries. The strong safety and environmental arguments against 44 tonne lorries must be taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1983, the most recent increase in permitted lorry weights, the higher weight limit and reduction in cost-per-tonne capacity was associated with a fall in efficiency, measured as the ratio of tonne-kilometre to capacity-kilometre. The Minister offered to circulate a consultation document published by his Department earlier this year. I have graphical evidence to show that, despite bigger and heavier lorries, efficiency has been reduced. The result is that far more vehicles made one journey and are unable to use the maximum space and weight for the return. Whatever might be said, there is no reduction in the total number of vehicles. There is good evidence to support the belief that empty running persists despite the size or weight increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other barriers to a reduction in empty running exist are not related to size. They include increasing specialisation of trucks; that backloads are financially unattractive; that the short average distance of haul in the United Kingdom reduces benefits; and directional imbalances in the flow of goods results in limited opportunity for those on return journeys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East mentioned safety. There is a myth that lorries are no more dangerous than cars but if the statistics are properly examined and analysed by number of axles and type of
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
road, the overall picture shows that heavy goods vehicles are substantially more dangerous than cars in terms of fatalities. They are only just comparable to cars for serious accidents. If lorry weight is to be increased to 44 tonnes and there is continuous operator licensing as introduced by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill, we are right to be concerned about safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the Government's plans to privatise the transport research laboratory. Its wealth of information and expertise could be used to develop the integrated transport systems that we want—the type that would increase and enhance safety measures for the general public. That is why we tabled the amendment. It is absolutely essential that transport planning should integrate land use planning with large lorry routing. That is why we want the proposal to be taken up in the European Parliament and resisted in every possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to question the notion that our reason for disliking the proposals is associated with subsidiarity. If there is overwhelming opposition to different proposals in Europe or if at least half the European Union nations have reservations and problems, various proposals are kicked out by the Council of Ministers. A special discussion about whether our dislike is related to subsidiarity or whether special derogations are required for different people seems beside the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the long run, many common transport facilities will be needed across the European union because vehicles that move about in this country will finish up on the continent. Therefore, although at the moment subsidiarity might seem relevant or useful as an argument, in the long run it perhaps ceases to be, if changes to a common European transport policy occur, intergrating road and rail transport. I find subsidiarity a very peculiar notion and I am perhaps arguing against it; it seems no more than a useful tool when people want to outlaw things they do not want. But maybe we should not find things undesirable just because they are undesirable for us. We should look at how matters affect Europe as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give an example from my constituency about the problems that arise from extra heavy lorries. In an area close to where I live, people want the jobs associated with heavy lorries while not wanting the hassle of heavy lorries—the noise, disruption and the various dangers they pose to the public. We need to ensure that jobs are protected and that the more serious problems are overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In getting to the local plants, lorries are obliged to cross a small railway bridge. It is exactly the type of example that the Minister said needs to be tested. We would have a huge problem if we had 44 tonne lorries that did not match the required standards because three firms would be in danger of being unable to continue working in the area. One of those firms, Excel Logistics, a freezer company is quite near the railway bridge, which has to be crossed to reach that company; while a bit further on, up Stubley Lane, there is Gunstones and Northern Foods, all dependent on large lorries moving in and out. Alongside the latter two firms and the Umstone-Dronfield bypass. There is no access from Dronfield onto the bypass and a small slip road from Gunstone and Northern Foods would be of tremendous assistance in overcoming many of the problems caused by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
lorries moving around. If a policy of designated roads for the use of large lorries were adopted, that bypass would be the type of road designated. If it is likely that the Wreakes lane and Stubley lane were designated, those jobs would be protected. As with other pollution problems nowadays one would not build facilities in the traditional way and have roads connecting residential areas and firms. We have to take things as they are, however and try to find better routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the railway link, I welcome the noises of encouragement in the Minister's speech for combined road-rail transport. I want to see some practical demonstration of that encouragement, however, and recent measures, such as forms of rail privatisation, do not assist in the adoption of that co-ordinated policy. The noises that have been made are welcome, but there is a long way to go in terms of producing policies and programmes that will convince Opposition Members that the interconnections and development that we envisaged will go ahead. In any rational society, rail should be used to move as much freight as possible, until no more rail capacity is available and freight is automatically transferred to roads. We should seek to develop that arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North and hope that the Minister will consider it and tell us whether he will accept it. It represents an addition to the Government's position and contains some welcome noises. Some additions might help us to progress down the road—or track—that we are on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.46 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss issues that are important for all our citizens. Their jobs often depend on road and rail freight and their quality of life depends on us controlling and providing an operational framework for such forms of transport. The matters before us are also important for those who are interested in wider policy issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we dispense with megaphone diplomacy and the arguments that take place in the wider forum and sit quietly in a serious Committee that is under your chairmanship, Dr. Blackburn, we shall discover that there are not a million miles or a rail track between us on many of the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East talked about cabotage. I am not sure why it is called that, although there must be a good reason for it. It means that lorries that are registered in one country ply for trade in another. Last year, Britain achieved a triumph in the community by gaining agreement on cabotage. It means that our freight vehicle operators will be able to ply for trade elsewhere in the Community. That is important for the commercial health and viability of our road freight industry. It is also important because, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent North, said, the empty running of lorries is economically wasteful. The average lorry travels 47,000 kilometres a year, for 13,000 of which it will have been empty. On international journeys, only 6 per cent. of British lorries return without a load. It is obviously in operators' interests to minimise empty running, but it is not always possible for back loads to be obtained for the return leg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
As I have said, many loads are constrained by volume and not by weight. That means that a lorry that is carrying a full load of low-density goods appears to be operating at below its maximum permitted weight—that is another statistical catch of which we should be aware when we talk about lorries apparently returning to this country underloaded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constituency problems to which the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East drew attention make it clear why it would be so difficult to have a rigorous regulatory framework. I suspect that you, Dr. Blackburn, and I could both think of similar circumstances in our constituencies whereby jobs and, therefore, the well-being of the local community, on production processes that require road transport but which would not always be appropriate for rail transport, as I think the hon. Gentleman would acknowledge. There must be an element of lorry transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned noise, danger and disruption to local people—what I call quality of life issues. He suggested that a solution would be a designated lorry route and access via a slip road into an existing bypass or principal or trunk road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of junctions exercises me greatly in wider policy terms, whether we talk about the M25 or the M62 or fairly small bypasses around towns and villages. A balance must always be struck between providing through routes—which are my natural responsibility, as Minister for Roads and Traffic—and catering for local needs. That is a difficult balance. There are too many examples around the country of roads that are designed to be part of the principal road network and which have become clogged with local traffic. I have no immediate answer to that problem, but it must be managed and I therefore welcomed the terms in which the hon. Gentleman puts his argument. We have to manage problems for which there may not be solutions because if one reaches a solution, a new problem will soon be found. The practicalities, as the hon. Gentleman put it, must be addressed here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to prolong the debate, I will say in response to the hon. Gentleman that I believe that privatisation of British Rail will lead to new investment in its freight and passenger facilities. Of course that investment will be made on the assumption that British Rail will be able to attract new customers, which is why the Government spent a great deal of taxpayers' money on freight terminals and other incentives, to persuade people to use rail wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the points made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North, of course, in deregulation, a balance must always be struck between the competitiveness of British industry—and therefore our position in European and world trade—and safety and other factors, which are valued highly by our citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An increasingly important aspect of the transport debate, which the hon. Lady left out, is the motive behind the movement of goods and people in this country. In the case of goods, increasingly manufacturing industry will say that what matters is predictability and not just speed of transit. After all, most production processes in the world now operate on the just-in-time principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be said that 100 years ago, the British railway industry was not so much a transport industry as a warehousing industry. Goods were tied up in sheds and wagons for days if not weeks, transiting between different areas of the country. That is no longer the case, which is one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
reason that roads take more than 90 per cent. of industrial freight. What matters is not so much the time it takes for goods to travel from A to B, but predictability. That provides a huge opportunity for the railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently spoke to the chairman of the Confederation of British Industry (Scotland). He would say that Scotland, as a peripheral region of the European Community, depends for its industrial prosperity on freight transport and that it does not matter too much whether it takes one day or three for freight to be moved from Scotland to the middle of Germany, for example. What matters is the predictability of the journey time and the certainty that that journey will not be disrupted by congestion or other unforeseen circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in getting the balance of deregulation right, we must ensure that our industry is at least as competitive as others elsewhere, and that we do not put unwarranted regulations in its way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to lorry routes, we discussed the London lorry ban, which will obviously be a matter for disagreement between us. I reiterate that there has been no change in the method of enforcing the ban. The bits of paper that were the evidence of the London lorry ban under the old regime did nothing to help enforcement, which still depended largely on the police stopping vehicles and checking their destinations and origins. That remains the case. We could argue about that for a long time, but that remains my position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt with the point about routing when we discussed the hon. Lady's amendment. As I said, the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 provides ways of achieving what is proposed in the amendment, so it is not necessary. I hope that we can agree on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised an important point on land use planning. The fact that the Department of Transport worked closely with the Department of the Environment on the production of "Planning Policy Guidance 13" on sustainable transport shows that we take land use planning and transport seriously. It is a slow process—it will not happen overnight. Reducing the need to travel will be increasingly important in future. Do not forget that the local plans and structure plans of our planning authorities include transport as an important element.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome as PPG 13 is, insofar as it relates to local planning matters, including land use planning, why do not the same constraints apply to the Government's national roads policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. The hon. Lady made it clear that she thought that the Government are increasing traffic, as she put it. The Department of Transport does not generate new traffic, nor do the Government—and the Opposition will not reduce it. New traffic is generated by economic prosperity and the way in which individuals and organisations in this country choose to transport themselves and their goods. It is primarily caused by economic growth. I await with great interest the report of the advisory committee on trunk road assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady spoke with some passion about the transport research laboratory. I shall refer to that briefly because I appreciate that this Committee is not the place to discuss it. We have considered its future carefully. I am second to none in my admiration of its work. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
motivated by my anxiety to see it continue for many years to come as a viable centre of research in this country and around the world. That is more difficult to achieve than perhaps the hon. Lady realises. We have discussed this issue elsewhere, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is considering the right way forward for that excellent laboratory in the coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The integrated approach to transport policy is well addressed in the Department of Transport's annual report. That may sound boring, but I wish that more people would read reports from Government Departments, and ours is no exception. It illustrates well how the Department of Transport works to provide a proper, balanced transport policy. We already skew our expenditure substantially in favour of public transport, which carries about 10 per cent. of journeys but receives about 40 per cent. of the budget. That is justifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In asking the Committee to approve the motion and to reject the amendment, we want to ensure that British industry is competitive in Europe and that we respect Britain's subsidiarity in debating the issue with other European Union members. We must also remember that the heart of today's debate is the straightforward policy issue of whether we want more freight traffic carried by rail. Nothing divides the Committee on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We certainly want more freight carried by rail. The real question is how to achieve that. The Minister said that it is not the Department of Transport that generates new traffic. However, we are talking about whether Government policies, as determined by the Treasury, are enabling the required investment in rail infrastructure to be made. Clearly, that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the £649 million of taxpayers' money already spent on preparing for rail privatisation had been spent on the west coast main line, through investment in essential route modernisation and in rolling stock, industrial freight would be transported by rail with a good chance of getting where it needed to go on time. The Minister raised the issue of predictability. Such matters are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need the report of the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment as quickly as possible, because it goes to the basis of transport policy. Our current roads and motorway widening programme is immune from planning issues. It is not integrated into the land use planning system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister pays lip service to our points about routing and investment in rail links, he provided no evidence. The powers may exist, as the Minister says, but the interests of the environment and of road users must be fully safeguarded. That would be helped by the introduction of designated routes and trans-shipment depots. We need such investment. For that reason, the amendment is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
