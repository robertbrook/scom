Landfill of Waste</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for the Environment and Countryside (Mr. Robert Atkins)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Mr. Jones, I should like to make a short statement about the proposals from the European Commission for a Council directive on the landfill of waste.<br><br>
It may be helpful to the Committee if, at the outset, I give a brief summary of the history of the proposal. In its resolution of 7 May 1990 on waste policy, the Council of the European Communities invited the European Commission to propose criteria and standards for the disposal of waste by landfill. The Commission made its original proposal for a Council directive on the landfill of waste—reference 5953/91—on 22 May 1991. The Department's explanatory memorandum dated 30 June 1991 deals with that in substance. The Commission's proposal was subsequently discussed by the European Parliament at its October 1992 plenary session. The Parliament tabled several amendments to the proposal, many of which were incorporated by the Commission in the revised draft of the proposal—reference 7506/93—which was published on 22 June 1993.<br><br>
The Department's explanatory memorandum dated 16 July 1993, which has been supplemented by the memorandum and compliance cost assessment of 10 January 1994, deals with that revised proposal. The June 1993 revised proposal helpfully shows the amendments made by the Commission alongside its original proposal. The Committee may therefore wish to concentrate on that version of the draft which is the subject of negotiations within the environment working group in Brussels.<br><br>
The proposal relates to wastes covered by the EC waste framework directive whose final destination is landfill disposal. It provides for landfills to be classified according to the types of waste to be disposed of and sets out waste acceptance criteria for each class of site. It includes a detailed permitting system for landfill sites, and sets out the operational measures to be taken to ensure a high level of environmental protection.<br><br>
The Department's explanatory memorandum of 16 July 1993 explains that the Government have two major worries about the latest draft proposal put forward by the Commission. I should like to say a few words about them. The first concerns subsidiarity. We place great importance on that principle; that is, that the Community should only act when the objectives of the proposed action can better be attained at the level of the Community than at the level of individual member states. The original proposal for the directive was drawn up before that principle was enshrined in the Maastrict treaty and endorsed at the Edinburgh Council. We are not convinced that the proposal in its present form takes full account of that principle.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
My predecessor, the hon. Member for Suffolk, South (Mr. Yeo), argued strongly at the Environmental Council in October last year that no convincing case had been made for Community action and that the proposal should, therefore, not be taken forward. Other member states, however, were keen for the proposal to proceed, and for the question of subsidiarity to be considered in relation to the detail of the proposal. We remain to be convinced. However, in the light of the support of other member states for the proposal, it is now clear that our overall objectives in the negotiations will be better served by concentrating our subsidiarity arguments on the provisions of the directive, rather than on the proposal as a whole. Indeed, our subsidiarity arguments have already led to suggestions from the Belgian presidency and the Commission for much of the detail in the annexes of the directive to be removed.<br><br>
Our second worry relates to the future of co-disposal under the directive. That is the new treatment of certain difficult industrial wastes by interaction with biodegradable municipal wastes in a controlled landfill site. Co-disposal makes use of the natural processes which take place in a landfill site when biodegradable waste decomposes to render harmless the potentially hazardous element of certain difficult wastes. The Commission's 1991 draft of the directive provided for co-disposal to take place when environmental benefits would be achieved. However, following the European Parliament's discussion of the directive, the Commission accepted an amendment proposed by the Parliament which would lead to a ban on that practice once the directive has been in force for five years.<br><br>
Co-disposal is a vital means of waste disposal in the United Kingdom. About 2.8 million tonnes of difficult industrial waste are disposed of in that way—about 70 per cent. of the annual total. Properly controlled, it is an environmentally sound practice. Uncontrolled co-disposal practices in some other European countries have led to quite different preceptions about the values and dangers of that form of waste disposal. Several countries are therefore strongly opposed to the practice. We have no wish to force other countries to adopt the practice, but we seek to convince our European partners that strictly controlled co-disposal is a valuable and safe method of waste disposal.<br><br>
We are also concerned about the economic consequences of a possible ban on co-disposal. The compliance cost assessment for the proposal shows that we can expect industry's waste disposal costs to increase by about £160 million if the co-disposal option is no longer available.<br><br>
I hope that I have given at least a brief insight into the proposal and those issues that concern us. As most members of the Committee will know, this is a new, interesting and somewhat challenging area of policy for me, but I shall do my best to answer all questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee might recall that questions can be put to the Minister for one hour after he started his statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister can help with a couple of points, which I shall try to put in the form of questions. He has given a usefully short history of the practice and the relationship on the subject between Her Majesty's Government and the EC. The practice started in 1990, and culminated in the amendments to the directive made in June 1993. Why is it urgent to discuss it now? What are the next steps? Will the Minister confirm
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0482">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
that the permit system and the level of environmental protection implicit in the directive operate within a framework that will not be harmful to, and could be useful for, the UK?<br><br>
The Minister rightly highlighted subsidiarity. We do not object to the principle, but will he assure the Committee that subsidiarity will not be used as a cover for inaction? Can he assure us that he is seriously pursuing that issue in its own right, not as a way to dodge our commitments.<br><br>
The Minister also spoke about co-disposal. Although we accept that in some circumstances it can be a useful way to dispose of certain sorts of waste, harmful environmental consequences will result if it is not properly controlled. I refer not only to other parts of Europe, but to co-disposal in the United Kingdom. Will the Minister therefore assure the Committee that co-disposal is properly controlled and can be usefully employed for the purposes outlined this morning?<br><br>
Finally, will the Minister give a breakdown of the £160 million costs that he said could be the result of the application of the directive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's questions. I shall try to deal with them in the order in which he asked them.<br><br>
This matter was taken up as an agenda item only during the Belgian presidency, and we expect it to be discussed in detail at either the March or June Environment Council, so it is already part of a process of discussion in the Commission. I should emphasise that co-disposal is an important factor in relation to landfill in this country because we have a different hydrological and geological structure. We have a large amount of clay, as anyone who has dug his garden will know. There are different perceptions in different parts of Europe as to how the system should work. We have former quarry sites, sites that have been used for brick making and other similar places, which are convenient and ideal, in properly stringent conditions, for landfill.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about restrictions and controls. The Control of Pollution act 1974 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990 apply. In May of this year, we shall implement the second part of the 1990 Act, which will mean even more stringent conditions on landfill control.<br><br>
I emphasise that we are not lagging behind Europe—it could be argued that we lead Europe in our current practice and in how we intend to control landfill in the future. We should differentiate between what used to happen when we had no controls and what we do now and intend to do in the future, which will be as strict as anything that we have done.<br><br>
I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an immediate breakdown on the £160 million, but we have had extensive consultations with industry, the regulators and Other Government Departments, and that is the generally accepted assessment. If I can find out more, I shall let the hon. Gentleman know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government still challenge the treaty base used by the Commission? Have they ruled out a possible challenge in the European Court of Justice if an acceptable text cannot be reached?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have some doubts about the article under which this is being proposed. My hon. Friend will know that because of the argument on subsidiarity, we are discussing whether article 130 or article 100A should apply. There is some dissention and we are discussing the matter with the Commission at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows that the article determines how we will deal with the legislation, will he assure us that if the matter is dealt with not under article 100A, but article 130, the British Government will be able to decide the future of this directive? Otherwise, is he saying that a qualified majority would be sufficient to push through the wording?<br><br>
The Commission's document states that it will not amend the proposal on insurance cover at present, because it thinks that it can do it another way. What is the Government's attitude to that development? Those matters will have a direct effect on the implementation of the directive. If harmonisation of waste disposal methods is not required, why are the Government willing to go along wih the Commisison's proposals? We must clarify whether the Commission has or does not have the right. All the other details fall by the wayside if the Commission accepts that it is handling the matter under the wrong article.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Lady's point. There is an argument about the section of the treaty under which this matter has been taken. The Commission says that it should be taken under article 100A as its legal base.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Qualified majority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, there is qualified majority. We have pushed for it to be taken under article 130S for the reasons that I explained earlier. In the discussions that we have already had, we have been unable to persuade other members that we should be given an exemption or encouraged to operate our own policy. That is why we have decided that we should concentrate on the detail of the directive rather than on its substance. Clearly, under qualified majority we are not going to win.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Liddington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend spell out in a little more detail what the balance of opinion is among his colleagues on the Council of Ministers about co-disposal? The issue is important to industry in this country. Is he in a one-to-11 minority or does he have some allies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have some allies; we are not alone. There is a difference of opinion. France and Germany do not have a geological structure similar to ours, and therefore have a particular problem with co-disposal. They practise mono-disposal—setting aside a permanent part in the landfill area for hazardous waste. Putrescent waste and others are disposed of in the normal way. They take a different view to us. We have some allies in Council, notably Ireland and, I believe, Portugal and we may be able to persuade others. Denmark has said that while it does not go about things our way, we have a case that we could continue.<br><br>
I emphasise that we are knowledgeable about what needs to be done now and in the future in relation to control of the sites. A lot of work is being done on the problem of liquor and leachate disposal, and especially of methane gas. I am confident that if we continue to operate under the stringent terms of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which come into force in May, we shall be able to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0483">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
demonstrate—as we already have through brochures, visits and general conversations with colleagues in the European Union—that we have a case on the detail of the directive.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) will know, I have not yet had a chance to meet many of my colleagues on the Environment Council. When I do, I shall emphasise the matter as strongly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have read the documents. Where are the results of consultations with organisations such as Friends of the Earth, the Council for the Protection of Rural England or any other agency concerned with protecting, promoting and advising on the environment? There seems to be an absence of such views, while in contrast, there is extensive reference to representations from the waste disposal industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman in detail. I shall make inquiries. I have been led to believe that we have consulted widely—for example with business, regulators, other Government Departments and those with an interest. I am advised that their views have been taken into account, but I shall certainly check.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McMaster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay), given that local authorities are responsible for waste disposal, what consultations has the Minister had with them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many private companies are involved in waste disposal and we must consult them too. Equally, we must consult companies involved in processes that require disposal of hazardous waste—such as chemical, engineering and petrochemical companies. He is right that local authorities have a part to play. We have consulted with them and have taken their views into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not imply that we are ahead of the pack on co-disposal. I understand, from a large application that has been made in my area and the technical submission with it, that the British Government are the only Government allowing applications for co-disposal at the moment. Will not the Minister just admit that we are afraid to face up to the fact that, if we get in line with everyone else, there may be negative economies for the private sector but great positive economies for the enviroment in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the premise of the hon. Gentleman's argument for a minute. As I said earlier, the structure in the United Kingdom in terms of hydrology and geology is different to that in many parts of Europe. We have operated the process for many years extremely successfully. We have knowledge of, and exercise control over, landfill which represents about 70 per cent of the disposal of waste in this country. It is properly controlled, and we are ahead of the pack in our knowledge of landfill processes. The way in which we control it is second to none.<br><br>
With regard to our contribution to the European Union, many of our colleagues recognise our knowledge and experience. I emphasise that we understand the concern and that we are not in any way behind in Europe—if anything, we lead because of our knowledge and expertise. I make no bones about that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Of course, there are other processes by which we can dispose of waste, of which incineration is one. Other countries have different ways of doing things. As long as we control our waste disposal and landfill sites properly—I refer not to what happened in the past, but to what is happening now and will happen in future—I have no fears on that score.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the presidency is now suggesting that very small sites should be excluded from the proposed regime on landfill? Such a proposal would seem to leave wide scope for abuse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. In some ways the proposal helps the case that we are making, by highlighting the fact that different countries have different requirements. The Greek presidency has proposed that the directive should not apply to landfills of less than 1 hectare—whatever that is. Consequently, we take the view, as we have always done—again, this is a measure of the control that we exercise—that that is unacceptable. We shall try to persuade the Greek presidency that, whatever the European Union decides to do, under the principle of subsidiarity we may continue to maintain control on all sites of all sizes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, local government in Northern Ireland is very restricted. District councils have only three powers—to provide community faculties, to provide cemeteries and to empty the bins. I understand the need to control the disposal of hazardous waste in a European context, but have we now reached a situation where the European Community is to tell the district councils in Northern Ireland how to empty their bins? If so, what are the financial implications for ratepayers in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman knows, my recent incarnation as the Minister responsible for those matters in Northern Ireland made me understand that there are particular problems there. As that Minister, I was particularly interested in waste disposal and related matters in Northern Ireland. My view is probably the same as his in respect of local authorities' lack of powers in Northern Ireland, but that takes us outside the context of this debate. They should have more responsibility, as is the case in the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman is right to point to the fact that if the costs were passed on to the private sector or directly to local authorities, that would create a severe burden for ratepayers, not least because under the chemical principle of co-disposal, a premium is paid by some private disposal companies to local authorities for putrescent waste, which is important in the co-disposal process. If, therefore, those costs were imposed on the companies, which passed them on to the local authorities by not paying the premium, that would affect ratepayers in Northern Ireland or council taxpayers in the rest of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not comment on the Commission's proposal in relation to insurance. I should like to hear his views on that and about hospital and clinical waste. Does he accept the undertakings in the original text? Do the Government accept that there should be a landfill aftercare fund? What is his view on the wording of that part of the text, which makes it clear that there will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0484">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
considerable interference from the Commission? Those are not minor powers; they are substantial. Will the Minister also comment on the reports that are called for, what action can be taken when they are received and what monitoring will take place at Commission level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is very perceptive and helpful. She draws the Committee's attention to several activities of the Commission, resulting from the implementation of the directive, that would worry us immensely. For example, several articles of and annexes to the directive provide for every single site to be monitored. We have more than 5,000 sites. The directive specifies what fencing should be used and what notices should be put up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Aftercare?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is all part of the aftercare. We find all that wholly unnecessary. We already have strict standards and are perfectly able to cope with the matter in our own country. Concerning the aftercare fund, the directive proposes that the operator of a landfill site will be liable for 10 years and that after that period a competent authority—however that is denned—will be responsible. We do not accept that. The operator should be responsible for the site indefinitely, or until such time as the situation changes and other developments occur. The aftercare fund should not be necessary because operators should be responsible for the care that is required.<br><br>
With regard to insurance, I assume that the hon. Lady is worried about civil liability and related matters. The directives would impose an additional burden. The Commission has recognised, under pressure from the Government, that it has not yet thought the matter through clearly. We anticipate a revision of its suggestion and further discussion among Environment Ministers at ensuing Councils. I suspect that the hon. Lady would agree that the Commission should spell out in stark terms what is involved and what the requirements will be. If necessary, we shall take a view contrary to its proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that to some extent he considers the Environmental Protection Act 1990 sufficient to meet the objective of the draft directive. Does that Act apply to Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know; I shall find out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed by the Minister's comments on co-disposal. I might have been more disappointed if I had been here to hear his opening statement. Does he know what is the normal method of disposal when there are serious problems with hazardous chemical waste? What is the guaranteed lifespan of the polythene liners recommended for such disposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend to be a chemist and cannot possibly respond to such a detailed technical question. As the hon. Gentleman appears to take an interest in the matter, he must be aware that there are different approaches to the disposal of waste within the Community. Parts of the Community have standards of waste disposal that are, frankly, much worse than ours. Because of the geology and hydrology of parts of our country, we have developed over many years a system of waste disposal using landfill in quarry and brick sites and other appropriate places, the co-disposal element of which is reckoned to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
environmentally sensitive. That is particularly true now that we have facilities to pipe off the liquor, leachate and methane gas. We can demonstrate that sites with co-disposal are better because of the chemical effects of the liquor and other things mixing with the putrescent municipal waste. Co-disposal is recognised as perfectly environmentally sound by some of our European colleagues, although they also recognise that it does not work as well for them because of their different geology and hydrology.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I refer the Minister to paragraph 15 of the document from north Strathclyde, which concerns co-disposal? Who says that co-disposal is environmentally sound? What evidence is there for that, other than that given by the industry?<br><br>
With regards to the reference to the uncontrolled disposal practices of other European countries, will the Minister tell us which countries those are?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Gentleman's last question, the Greeks admit that they do not always have the facilities to control disposal. There is also evidence, which I can bring to the attention of the hon. Gentleman if he so wishes, of individual cases in individual countries. One reason why some countries want to do away with co-disposal and landfill sites is that they do not have the facilities or the control, or both, to do what we have been doing in this country. Our measures have been successful and we shall continue with them in a careful and environmentally sensitive way.<br><br>
To answer the hon. Gentleman's question about who advises, there are Government scientific advisers and the industry, which he dismisses with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to differ. My experience of the industry in my constituency and elsewhere is that it has a good record in many respects. Of course, there are worries, but the stringent controls that we have exercised—and will exercise after 1 May—ensure that our industry acts properly. It contributes substantially to reducing the costs of hazardous waste disposal for other industries, let alone the costs for local authorities of paying permium rates for putrescent waste.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should consider more carefully the attitude of the industry, the contribution that it makes and the extra costs that I assume—I infer from what he said—he intends to put on industry generally to the tune of about £160 million, which will make its life much more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister is aware that what he claims are the environmentally sensitive actions of organisations in Britain are better known as dump and pray. He admitted that he does not have great technical expertise; no one knows what those mixes will do in the long term, with the disposal of hazardous waste along with other types of waste in co-disposal sites.<br><br>
The guaranteed life of the liners is 20 years. I am currently involved in the consideration of a large application to turn a green-field site into a dump, so I know quite a lot about the subject. I wish to ask the Minister several questions about what we might be left with if we dilute the policies that are proposed in the directive. For example, what prejudice do the Government have against
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0485">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
dumping in proximity to a site of special scientific interest? What is their attitude to dumping in green-field sites and farm land, which are not quarries or open spaces at present, but which are to be designated for the purpose of creating disposal sites?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised are entirely matters for a planning authority—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span> <i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. They are matters for a planning authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Secretary of State intervenes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true of any planning application at any time. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am not a planning Minister; if a planning Minister wishes to call attention to something it is entirely a matter for him or her. Given the hon. Gentleman's constituency, the relevant Minister would be my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland or one of his Ministers. The hon. Gentleman must know that that happens more often than not in circumstances where there is public controversy or concern. In some ways, he is seeking to undermine conditions that work perfectly well at present.<br><br>
With regard to the hon. Gentleman's comments about technicalities, I said that I did not pretend to be a chemist, but that I understood and had been advised, about the position in relation to co-disposal. Again, I emphasise to the Committee that we have nothing to fear about the policy that we have operated for many years. If a landfill product that is properly controlled in relation to leachate, methane gas and whatever else is essentially inert, I have no worries about landfill sites—subject, as I said, to that proper control.<br><br>
Our advice from EC officials and a number of our colleagues in Europe is that they recognise that we lead and have expert knowledge in that respect, and that our controls are stringent. That does not mean that other methods of disposal of particular hazardous waste through incineration or other methods are not used. Of course, they are used; we must, however, recognise that for many years to come, 70 per cent. of the disposal of waste in this country will be through landfill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister any evidence that the treatment of landfill in one European country impinges on either the commercial or environmental interests of the treatment of landfill in another European country? What basis has been used to justify the harmonised proportions? I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to annex III of the Commission document that begins with the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in order to harmonise technical characteristics of landfills".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has asked a jolly good question; it is certainly one that we shall be asking. I agree with what she said, in that the worries of some countries are being reflected on other countries without justification. I accept her argument. The United Kingdom, however, does not regard that issue as a particular problem because we, being an island, control the vast proportion of our waste—the methods by which we do so having been built up over the years. Treatment may have an effect on other countries in Europe, whose boundaries are less clearly defined than ours in terms of geology and hydrology. I shall certainly take up the matter with my colleagues throughout Europe.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Incidentally, I am still awaiting a reply to my question about Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the measure does not apply to Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that one of the problems with the waste disposal industry is that some tips are not completed; the owners or the operators of such sites go bust or simply walk out on the job. How will the Minister ensure that financial guarantees are in place, so that the tips can be completed in the minimum period of time and capped at no cost to the public purse? If he rejects those financial guarantees that have been proposed by the directive, what guarantees, bonding or other arrangements does he intend to propose?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not reject out of the hand the after-care guarantees. In answer to the hon. Lady's question about the directive proposing 10 years for an operation, I said that the Government do not believe that there should be such a limit, but that the operator should retain such a responsibility indefinitely.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to some tips being open longer than others, which I know is a problem in his area. I accept that particular concern has been expressed about some tips that have been open for some time, and he was right to raise the issue. I am trying to persuade the Committee of the merit of stringent controls in the future as presently attains now. Some practices in the past have not been acceptable nor have they been as good as we would have wished for. I suspect that all members of the Committee agree with that. I am concerned about now and the future, and we want to ensure that stringent controls operate both in relation to those who control the sites as well as to those who use them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister on the high regard that he has for co-disposal. Organisations that are trying to improve our attitude towards the environment are most worried about the system for the disposal of hazardous waste, which is based on there being a 1 mm thick liner inside which there is a layer of clay. When such a system is operating near running water, rodents can puncture the lining by boring through it. The material might soon cease to be inert and an active chemical reaction could be created, especially when it comes from a chemical plant such as that in Grangemouth in my constituency. Does the Minister intend to introduce into the directive a measure that would consist of much more stringent regulations for the disposal of waste near running water?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must bear in mind that any environmental practice must be set against the short, medium or long-term costs and how much the public and industry are prepared to pay. In an ideal world, we would not be here; but we are where we are and we have taken action over the years to seek to control co-disposal and to monitor landfill. Indeed, under the terms of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which comes into effect on 1st May, we shall be able to exercise even more stringent control.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about running water. The National Rivers Authority regularly tests water in various parts of the country and is able to highlight problems and deal with them quickly. I emphasise again that we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0486">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
believed for years that we should dispose of our own waste. The cost of changing immediately—the solution offered by the hon. Gentleman—would be extremely high. It would cost £160 million or more. Someone has to pay.<br><br>
Other methods of disposal may be possible—incineration is one and mono-disposal in some areas is another. The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting mono-disposal. Under that system, a separate area is provided within a landfill site for hazardous waste, but that is essentially environmentally unfriendly. It will be there for ever and will require extra monitoring, administration and control. Co-disposal, when properly controlled, works for certain wastes and has proved to be environmentally sound. It can therefore be continued with the support of those who understand the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span> <i>rose—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. At this stage I ask for questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that waste disposal costs generally represent only a small part of each company's total expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair comment, taken over a number of companies. However, in a recent exercise, we found a company with a substantial turnover in respect of which the cost of waste disposal would be increased by a noticeable figure. Taken across the whole of industry, that will produce the sort of figure that I gave earlier. It will be an extra cost. As I said to the right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor), co-disposal operates successfully for some municipal authorities and premium payments are made for putrescent waste, but that may suffer and ordinary ratepayers, too, will have to meet extra costs.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked about clinical waste. I now have an answer. We are consulting on new guidance about clinical waste. Dangerous and offensive waste should be incinerated, but some clinical waste can be disposed of normally in landfill. However, if there is doubt—for instance, with low-level radio-active waste from hospitals—it is dealt with separately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his previous role as Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, the Minister was responsible for local government in Northern Ireland and was consulted about the directive. Did he respond favourably or unfavourably on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say that I have enough trouble coping with my present brief, without having to remember without advice what I did in my previous post. I do not recall the details, but I would have taken a similar view to that which I expressed to the right hon. Gentleman's first question. If he writes to me, I shall try to remember what I said then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In paragraph 11 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum, Baroness Denton draws attention to the waste shipments regulations and the fact that member states in the European Community are empowered to refuse or regulate the importation of waste from other countries—for example, from the European Union, EFTA or the third world. Do the Government intend to exercise their right under those regulations to halt
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
the importation of waste from other countries—particularly, but not exclusively, from third-world countries?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not apply to this directive. I shall seek advice on the technical points that the hon. Gentleman raised. We are talking about landfill disposal, so it is not likely to effect the transport of waste across national borders, of which we do not do much in the context of landfill. I shall check on that and let the hon. Gentleman know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that by increasing disposal costs, industry would be forced to concentrate on waste minimisation and recycling, which would have environmental and economic benefits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. It is the responsibility of Departments such as mine and the Department of Trade and Industry to try to persuade industry to recognise that waste minimisation and management is not only important environmentally, but that it is a profitable operation. Industry could produce products in a cleaner and more environmentally sensitive way and could persuade its consumers that it was attractive. We have very strict rules. The constituency of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) has substantial industry in and around the Merseyside area, and he will know how strict the regulations are, through HM inspectorate of pollution and a variety of other controlling devices. The hon. Gentleman may find that some companies complain about the fact that the legislation is so strict.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's point is fair. When I was the Minister responsible for industry as well as the environment in Northern Ireland, I tried to persuade industry and environmentalists that both areas of activity were indivisible. Industry must be aware of the environment; environmentalists must be aware of how important companies are in terms of creating jobs, making profits for further investment, and so on. We shall continue to persuade industry to consider the environment, but we must recognise that if industry is to be successful, part of Government policy generally should be to put less rather than more regulation on it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have concluded our On Time, so it is now appropriate for the Minister to move his motion and to speak to it.</span></p>
<p>11.18 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee. It is a daunting experience—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody <span class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite right too, as the hon. Lady says. Having been a Minister in Northern Ireland when I had to deal only with hon. Members who were extremely precise in their questions and careful about the pressure that they put on me, I am a little out of touch with such Committees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Wait until we get a Select Committee.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0487">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, I shall not be the Minister who has to respond in those circumstances. I am tempted to read my way through yet another speech, but I suspect on the basis of what the Committee has aleady asked, that I can move the motion formally and sit down.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 5953/91 and 7506/93 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department of the Environment on 10 January 1994, relating to the landfill of waste; endorses the Government's view that the proposal is unnecessarily detailed and prescriptive and does not take sufficient account of the principle of subsidiarity which is enshrined in the Treaty of European Union; welcomes the Government's intention to press for the removal of a number of the more detailed provisions now that it is clear that other Member States wish to take forward the Directive; supports the Government's view that carefully controlled co-disposal is an environmentally sound practice, the banning of which in the United Kingdom would be detrimental to the environment and would lead to significantly increased disposal costs for certain types of industrial waste; and endorses the Government's intention to seek a common position in Council which would allow those countries who practise controlled co-disposal to continue to do so.—[<i>Mr. Atkins.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>11.19 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should not like the Minister to think that because we questioned him toughly, the process ends there. I assure him that we have some serious criticisms still to make. The Minister referred at least once to my constituency, where the issue of waste disposal is hugely contentious. Questions are raised such as whether it should be by infill or incineration, and so on. There are two reasons for that. The first is that there is a great deal of money to be made from waste disposal. Although there is nothing necessarily wrong with that, my constituents—good Labour voters that they are—become suspicious when people start making money out of such processess, which might have profoundly bad effects on the environment.<br><br>
Two years ago, the local authority was involved in a major row that ended up as a planning inquiry into the siting of a medical waste incinerator. My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara) will remember the risks that the local authority took in turning down that planning application. The council's legal department warned that members faced surcharge, incarceration and goodness knows what other kinds of punishment if they turned it down. The matter went to a planning inquiry, which we lost.<br><br>
There is a current proposal to create a landfill site in my constituency, and I have supported local residents who oppose it for various reasons, including the heavy transport damage that would be caused to the narrow lanes leading to the proposed site. It interests me greatly that the principals behind the latest application for a landfill site in my constituency are a night club owner, the new manager of Liverpool football club—I wish him well in that endeavour—and a solicitor. What interest those three people have in such a venture, other than making money, I do not know. None of them is noted for his environmental concern. When such people get involved, it shows that there is money to be made.<br><br>
Two contentious issues arise from the documents. The first is whether there should be European legislation on the subject at all. My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) raised some important questions about what is and is not appropriate in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
framework of European Community law. The Government claim that EC involvement can be justified on single market grounds, as there is little market in waste, and the principles of self-sufficiency and proximity commit the European Union to stop the existing trade in waste. There may be some truth in that.<br><br>
The Government's other claim was repeated by the Minister on at least three occasions in his responses to questions. I do not suggest that that was boring; it was necessary for him to do so. The Government argue that the main factor dictating landfill and its success or otherwise in this country is geology, which means that UK prices are lower. Again, that may be true, but the Government ignore the fact that more lax waste disposal standards in some other member states could encourage dumping with its environmental consequences. To avoid higher standards, the location of industries in those states could be determined by that principle, rather than along more rational lines. That could undermine the efforts of other member states to raise standards. We are worried about those possibilities.<br><br>
The Government also ignore the fact that the European Union is committed not just to a single market, but to securing a high level of environmental protection. That is a matter of considerable importance to the Opposition. I know that our concern is generally shared, but it must be a high priority in practice. We believe that there should be a European Union directive on landfill, but that it should be passed under environmental articles, rather than single market articles.<br><br>
The second contentious issue is the co-disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, which we believe should probably be banned. It is estimated, as the Minister said, that a ban would cost UK industry £160 million; he promised to provide a breakdown of that sum. Presumably, that would principally affect the chemical, pharmaceutical, metals and engineering industries, which would bear most of the costs.<br><br>
Some reputable UK commentators argue that co-disposal is not only safe as an environmental option—provided it is properly carried out and regulated—but safer, as the hazardous waste can react with non-hazardous waste and is, therefore, broken down more quickly. They also argue that other member states have a bad view of co-disposal because it is being carried out in unsafe manner in other parts of the European Union. The Minister put forward that view this morning.<br><br>
Although there may be some validity in those claims, we believe that there are other relevant considerations which need to be taken into account. On the basis of the precautionary principle—which we believe to be important in environmental protection—co-disposal should be banned unless it can be shown to be safe beyond reasonable doubt. On the basis of the evidence so far, co-disposal cannot be said to have been shown to be safe beyond reasonable doubt. That issue divides us. Also, we may conclude that increasing the cost of waste disposal to landfill is not necessarily a bad thing. The Labour party is committed to the introduction of a landfill levy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mackinlay <span class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a new commitment. It will be part of an overall waste management strategy. As we currently send more than 90 per cent. of UK waste to landfill,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0488">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
increasing the cost of waste disposal could encourage industry to concentrate on waste minimisation, re-use and recycling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain how much the levy will cost industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The tediousness with which the hon. Gentleman asks that question on every possible occasion—it is tedious, tedious, tedious; I do not dare use the word "shifty"—makes it hardly worth his while making the point. I am not going to state exactly the Labour's party's costings of every proposal—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. To help the Committee, I shall draw attention to the fact that we are discussing landfill. I know that the hon. Gentleman will proceed with his case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not be distracted. Substantial savings are to be made for British industry through waste reduction. Project Catalyst on Merseyside—I have the honour to represent a part of Merseyside—suggests that reductions of between 10 per cent. and 30 per cent. in solid waste production are available in a range of industries, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals and appliance manufacture. The project indicates that paybacks of fewer than three years are available on current disposal prices. Any increase in disposal costs should lead to a reduction in waste, but not to an increase in industrial costs. That would be a desirable result. All those points suggest that the onus is on the supporters of co-disposal to prove that it is a positive environmental option. If it is not, the fact that banning co-disposal will lead to an increase in disposal costs should not be accepted as a reason for continuing the practice.<br><br>
In conclusion, we should really concentrate on a national waste strategy, which encourages waste reduction, re-use and recycling before the option of disposed. The Government are not doing enough. They should be fostering markets for recycled goods and using economic instruments to encourage waste avoidance. Where landfill is necessary—there are such occassions—a system regulated to ensure that waste is chemically and physically stabilised so that it does not cause leachate or landfill gas should be introduced.<br><br>
Concentration on whether a particular technique such as co-disposal is acceptable means that we risk losing sight of the broader picture, especially when the case is presented as one of us in the UK against them in Europe. On the basis of our remaining fears, we shall seek to divide the Committee.</span></p>
<p>11.29 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the hazards of any subject that touches on the environment is that the Opposition strongly wish to protect it. We want to ensure that industrial detritus is not allowed to make life intolerable for those who live near the places where it is sited.<br><br>
Quite rightly, some of the debate has been firmly directed towards the environmental hazards that arise from the disposal of waste. However, I wish to refer to a rather different point and I hope that the Minister will bear with me. One of the dangers of what is proposed by the Commission is that, without having been properly researched and thought out, it gives rise to considerable implications.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
The word "subsidiarity" never appealed to me, but the theory is important. In parentheses, may I say that no one in the House of Commons should be allowed to get away with some of the words that appear in the document that we are considering. With the best will in the world I am sure, the Commission has produced a document that could have a great impact with no clear evidence that it is needed, will be effective or do more than cause problems for those who will have to implement it.<br><br>
I start with what may seem to be a dry point, but one that is fundamental. The Select Committee said that it wanted to be sure that the document had the right legal basis and the reason for that is simple. If the proposal is acceptable under article 100A, the Commission will virtually be able to railroad through whatever it likes by obtaining the joint agreement of all the other nations which, for their own internal reasons, are worried about landfills that are affected by land boundaries. That may be perfectly legitimate for those countries, but it is the poorest reason in the world for us to accept the impact of legislation that is neither necessary nor workable.<br><br>
I am worried by the Minister's bland assurance that we tried that but, unfortunately, it did not work, so we have backed off and are now saying that the matter may not be entirely connected with the environment and can be discussed under article 100A. That policy will lead the Government into great difficulty and mean that the House will have to consider badly researched legislation. I am already sufficiently worried by the Government's legislation without having to worry about EC legislation.<br><br>
With regard to the wording of the directive, I may be getting old and cynical—[hon. Members: "No."] Oh, perish the thought. However, when I read that many of the controls will rely on written annual reports of matters submitted to the Commission, I had a tiny laugh to myself. It is not only that some nations in the Community are very good at producing bits of paper, but that the same countries are not very good at applying the physical controls that should lie behind the yearly reports.<br><br>
There is clear evidence that the proposal could end as a slightly absurd imposition whereby the British are running around and taking action over our landfill sites while everyone else produces written reports that bear no relation to control of the environment. I hope that the Minister will deal with that point.<br><br>
If the Government accept the proposal as an environmental measure, that makes it a vital matter that is way beyond the discussion of legislative controls. Anyone who has had anything to do with the disposal of waste in Britain knows that, fundamentally, we are a fairly filthy nation. We throw away vast amounts of waste every day, so the subject of landfill sites is both politically and commercially sensitive. Those of us who have sat on a planning committee to decide whether a piece of land is suitable for landfill, know that anyone who can get his hands on the site before a local authority needs to use it will gain an immediate profit without any commitment or difficulty. The question of landfill is already sensitive.<br><br>
Landfill sites in my constituency have been used for diseased carcases infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. That has environmental implications. It is true that the Government's rules and regulations on the matter are good and precise. However, people living near such sites worry. They say, "I didn't see those carcases being covered with lime; I didn't see that procedure being

carried out. Can I be sure that my children will not be affected by anything that is leaching from that site if diseased carcases are buried there?" Such concern is inevitable. Human nature being what it is, people will add two and two and make eight and a half even when the rules are followed.<br><br>
If there is even a slight danger of people being affected by what happens in landfill sites, there will rightly be strong pressure on elected representatives. That pressure needs to be strong, because we all know of companies that will cut corners from time to time because they see a positive advantage in doing so. We need measures that control landfill sites, that respond to the real needs of people who live near them and provide workable controls on commercial interests. The Department's own figures make it clear that the proposed changes would have only a marginal effect. The figures that the Minister quoted sound dramatic, but his own evidence is that the impact on operating costs would be, if not minor, then not very significant. If commercial firms are to oppose any kind of restriction, they must be able to justify that opposition very specifically. So far, the Minister has not made that case.<br><br>
I am very concerned about what happens to clinical waste. Many national health hospitals need new incinerators and, in the interim, are faced, with the problem of how to dispose of clinical waste, which may be only low-grade radioactive or infectious waste, but nevertheless involves a degree of risk. Unless a great injection of money is given to the NHS to provide incinerators, the problem will continue and grow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with virtually everything that the hon. Lady said, apart from her claim to be growing old and cynical. Does she agree that more should be done to educate the consumer? She referred to reducing the amount of waste, which would in turn reduce the amount, of landifill space needed. More could be done to educate consumers. They could force industry to use less packaging on the items that they buy in stores and refuse to accept paper bags—unless absolutely necessary—and carrier bags, which take longer to degrade in landfill sites.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am all for re-education. I always hope for the re-education of Conservative Members, but I have been in the House a long time and it has not happened so far. It is no use talking about re-educating the consumer if the faculties are not there. If materials are to be recycled, local authorities must have the opportunity to provide the necessary outlets for collection. My local authority is excellent. Not only does it provide clearly marked recycling points, but it continually encourages people to sort their own waste. I enjoy throwing away wine bottles, because that is the only time that I am allowed to smash glass and feel virtuous.<br><br>
Pollution is a fundamental problem. We live on an island that is becoming smaller by the second. It already suffers considerable problems because of the pollution caused by its population. The Government must be more imaginative; they must put more effort into solving the problems. They must involve industry in partnership and channel the genuine worries of environmentalists. The population have many vague worries about the environment, which are frequently exacerbated by television programmes that hihglight a particular aspect, but forget to put it in context. The Government should ensure that people know what is happening.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
I oppose the Government's attitude. Although the nation says that this is wrong and that is wrong, and that the wretches are not listening to what we are saying, it does not say clearly what the Government do intend to do. If they believe that the Commission's suggestion is wrong, they have the power to oppose it effectively. However, they may believe that the Commission is doing the wrong thing, but say, "We will back off because it is not sufficiently important and we can do a deal on something else." If so, they should highlight environmental protection rather than commercial protection. They should also say what costs they expect industry to bear.<br><br>
The Opposition hope that the Minister will continue to appear before our Committees to be closely questioned for an hour. More Ministers should submit themselves to questioning, because the procedure pays enormous dividends. If we were able to do something similar with internal legislation, the Government would not have made such a muck-up.</span></p>
<p>11.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make no apology for trespassing on the Committee's discussions as a non-member of the Committee. About 14 per cent. of Thurrock—one seventh of the land surface of the borough—is subject to mineral extraction and waste tipping. Both industries are tied up with the business of landfill. To those who fly over it, my borough looks like a moonscape. For generations, that has been an enormous problem for the people of Thurrock. Indeed, the sense of outrage was brought home to me by the fact that after the Lord President of the Council made the business statement on Thursday, I received unsolicited telephone calls from constituents drawing my attention to the fact that European Standing Committee A would today debate land fill waste. They rightly expected me to attend this morning. I refer especially to the vigilance of two retired constituents, Dilys Stone and Eddie Hockley, who made particular representations.<br><br>
The Minister has had a baptism of fire. I place on record the courtesy shown by the Minister and his Parliamentary Private Secretary, the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes). They recognise my constituents' special problems and have said that they are willing to meet me about those matters. I hope that the Minister finds time to join me in Thurrock so that he can see the problems at first hand. He should meet members of organisations such as CAPPA—the Campaign Against Poisonous Pits in Aveley—and councillors, including Councillor Barry Palmer, who has been in the forefront of resistance to planning applications for landfill. The Minister should also meet the heads of primary schools there because evidence suggests that close proximity to landfill waste sites increases instances of bronchitis and other ailments among school children. I look forward to taking up the Minister's kind offer.<br><br>
Those are all the nice, conciliatory things that I can say this morning because I am disappointed and dismayed by the Government's attitude to the draft directives. They are seizing on the now fashionable concept of subsidiarity to avoid facing up to their duties and responsibilities while dealing with a major environmental problem. They are not prepared to do what is necessary for my constituents and for people elsewhere in Britain to control the rapacious appetite of the waste industry for landfill sites.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0490">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
Even if the draft directives breach the so-called principles of subsidiarity, I want a Government who will try to outdo the enthusiasm of the European Community, will place environmental legislation on the statute book, will put a high price on landfill and will make the producers of waste find alternatives by treating waste or by diminishing the amount of waste that is generated. A Labour Government would do that. We need a bold initiative.<br><br>
It is not often that I agree with Baroness Thatcher, but at a Conservative party conference she pointed out that those of us on planet Earth do not own it and must fulfil the obligations of a full-repairing lease. Baroness Thatcher and her friends would get A for rhetoric, but Z for achievement. That is reflected in the Government's lack of zeal in recognising their obligation to protect our environment and the land on which we live, work and wish to develop our homes and industries.<br><br>
The Government did not shout foul at the European Council in May 1990. They raised the concept of subsidiarity only when Euro-bashing and dismissing almost every proposal emerging from Brussels became fashionable in the Conservative party. Even if I am wrong about subsidiarity—which I do not think that I am—the British Government should be proudly in the lead in protecting the environment and in introducing domestic legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And we are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made great play of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which he seems to think is a good substitute for or complement to the directives. I reject that. The Minister had to concede that that Act does not apply to all parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not be drawn into constitutional issues. He has been to Northern Ireland—under my auspices, as it happens—and must recognise that the position there is different. Just because this directive does not apply there does not mean that people in Northern Ireland are not aware of the problem and are not dealing with it in their own way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to trespass into the constitutional issues of Northern Ireland—heaven forbid! My point is that the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is no substitute for a directive that applies across western Europe, which I regard as little more than a village these days. We are all interdependent and, increasingly, we travel within and work all over western Europe. We need an immediate initiative across western Europe to protect the environment, but United Kingdom legislation does not even cover all the territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I do not want to labour the point, but I think that it is a legitimate one.<br><br>
We were told that the Select Committee on European Legislation required, in its 36th report, that a report should be prepared of consultations with interested parties. There has been a lack of detailed documentation showing proper consultation with interested parties. We have certainly received, written in large letters, the views of the waste disposal industry, but we have received no documentation from the Council for the Protection of Rural England, or Friends of the Earth or those other public and voluntary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
organisations which, thank goodness, exist to protect, promote and argue for good environmental regulations, legislation and practice. We have seen nothing to suggest their views and I suggest that the matter has been dealt with inadequately—that the attention of those bodies has been drawn to the subject as if one were to bang on a door with a wet sponge. That is regrettable. If I am wrong, why were not such submissions included in the documents for this morning's meeting?<br><br>
I welcome several of the propositions in the draft directives. The concept of pre-testing of waste is most important. It is not being carried out in the United Kingdom except for what is known as special waste. Much liquid industrial waste is not inspected. Surprisingly, from what I can make out, my county, Essex, requires, through local legislation, pre-notification of disposal of liquid industrial waste other than special waste. However, that is peculiar to Essex. It is not a United Kingdom provision and clearly it should be. I speak not only for Thurrock or Essex, but like all other hon. Members, I am proud to promote the interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. There is a poverty of legislation for ensuring that local authorities receive prior notice of the disposal of liquid industrial waste. The draft directives would at last provide for that.<br><br>
The Minister referred, in response to comments about co-disposal, to the cost of mono-disposal. He argued that mono-disposal is very expensive. I believe that higher charges are needed to persuade the producers of waste that they must find alternatives. They must diminish the volume of waste, and where waste is created it should be treated. If there is a price to pay, so be it.<br><br>
Outside the window of the Committee Room is something that parallels my point. When Pugin and Barry built this beautiful building a century and a half ago and gave Members of the House of Commons the Terrace on the river Thames, something happened. They overlooked the fact that that recreational area for Members of Parliament was built on an open sewer. That interface between politicians and the open sewer of the Thames raised the immediacy of the case for environmental legislation, water protection legislation and the creation of the Embankment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not at all sure that parliamentary landfill is in order in this debate. Will the hon. Gentleman keep strictly in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mackinlay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Jones. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) made a point on this subject, and if he were to live near a landfill site I believe that he would be persuaded to support my contention that the directives are appropriate, just as the Victorian legislators perceived the need for legislation on sewage and water treatment.<br><br>
I mentioned earlier the cost and inadequacy of protection relating to tip operators. There is no guarantee at present that tips will be completed. Firms go bust and operators disappear. Tips are then left incomplete, as a blot on the environment. There is not always adequate capping. The directives would provide a fund to ensure their completion. The response to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich on that point was inadequate. Clearly, the insurance companies are nervous about guaranteeing that tips are completed.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
The figures for the compliance cost assessment presented to us were drawn up in association with the industry. They showed that the price to pay would be high; to paraphrase, "They would, wouldn't they?" I would expect that; the document is not objective and it should be disregarded.<br><br>
Our discussions this morning are taking place against the backdrop of the Government's failure to comply also with the European moves towards independent environmental impact assessment reports on planning applications for landfill and waste disposal. Such compliance is necessary. It is disappointing that on every move and measure introduced by Europe to promote and protect our environment, such as that under discussion, the Government take the mean and short-sighted course of rejecting such initiatives. They should be ashamed of that, and I believe that such action will tell against them at the next general election.</span></p>
<p>11.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must get up to speed on chemical matters. He has done a good job this morning, but he must examine seriously the proposals put forward by those who are briefed on the issue and who know of the long-term effects of mixing the types of waste that are mixed under the co-disposal system.<br><br>
Grangemouth in my constituency contains the largest petrochemical complex in Great Britain. It produces 14,000 tonnes of waste per year, of which a large proportion is the type of waste that will go into co-disposal. That is causing great worry to members of the community. BP Chemicals has just opposed a landfill application at Inveravon farm, which is near its complex, The site was not regarded as suitable as it was a green-field site and the application proposed a co-disposal system.<br><br>
The expense of waste disposal is small when compared with the expenditure of those who produce the waste. For example, BP Chemicals spent £600 million last year on a new ethylene cracker in Grangemouth, which will obviously produce waste that must be disposed of. I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North for saying that he will press the Committee to a Division—for putting down a marker in the Committee today. A Labour Government would not think that they needed to know the price of everything without thinking of the cost to the community and the value of proposals. The Minister's main argument seemed to be that treatment other than co-disposal might cost more.<br><br>
The value to our children and our children's children of getting rid of co-disposal remains. The liners that are used in the landfill sites are covered only by 20 year guarantees. Rodents' boring into the clay near water sources means that the material is penerated quickly. That results in a toxic mix; what the effects of that will be during the lifespan of future generations is unknown. We must stop co-disposal now. The Government seems, once again, to want Britain to become the dirty man of Europe. If they cannot do any better than the proposal that they have put forward, they will be found wanting by the people of Great Britain, not simply in terms of their economic policy—about which they have already been found out—but in terms of their care for our environment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<p>11.59 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lidington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: No member of the Committee would fault the hon. Members for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay) and for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) for speaking up on behalf of their constituents who are directly affected by the disposal of landfill waste as my constituents and those of other hon. Members are not.<br><br>
It is important, however, that we try to disentangle the two related issues that are germane to our debate. The first is the record of the methods adopted by the United Kingdom for the safe disposal of waste through landfill. The second is whether the means described in the draft directive provide us with the best way forward in seeking to sustain the high standards that the British waste disposal industry has generally followed.<br><br>
I do not seek to quarrel with anything said today by Opposition Members about the necessity for the highest possible standards in the disposal of industrial and other forms of waste through landfill. The hon. Member for Falkirk East may have been too hasty in assuming that co-disposal is inevitably less safe than mono-disposal. Surely, much must depend not only on the geology and hydrology of a site but on the standards operated by the company that manages it and the regulatory regime established by the Government and local authorities of the country in which it is located.<br><br>
To say the least, it is certainly arguable that, in a country that had a lax regulatory regime or an operator who did not meet the high standards that we expect of the United Kingdom waste disposal industry, it would be possible to regard mono-disposal as an unsafe way of getting rid of dangerous waste. If the barriers of the dump were breached, the contents of the site would have to be evacuated and disposed of more safely somewhere else. Where co-disposal is properly managed, there is a prospect of chemical reactions between different types of waste that can add to the safety of that method.<br><br>
I wish to discussl the way in which the European Union has decided to tackle the problem. I had considerable sympathy with many of the arguments made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister and the Government on the way in which they seek to amend the directive to take account of the different needs of different European countries. However, I question whether the Government are taking an adequately robust stand on the matter of the treaty base.<br><br>
Article 100A provides for straightforward qualified majority voting to secure the harmonisation of national measures to promote the objectives of the single market. Article 130S has not been tested as it is part of the new Maastricht agreement but it involves qualified majority voting. However, its provisions are subject to a definition of the scope of European environmental policy laid out in article 130R(2), which specifically refers to the need for such policy to take into account the diversity of different regions of the European Community.<br><br>
Article 130S also comes some way towards meeting the objections of Opposition Members by specifically laying down in article 130T that member states are entitled to legislate for more stringent safeguards than those provided for in any rather broadly framed European directive. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues will continue to bear in mind the dangers of allowing a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0492">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
precedent to be set by their acceptance of article 100A, even if they were to secure the changes that they want in the text of the directive.<br><br>
One does not have to be a Europhobe or hostile to the idea of European co-operation and sensible common measures to see that the European Commission, understandably, has institutional ambitions. It will seek to use article 100A to broaden its remit and initiate legislation at European level on as many different aspects of policy as possible. To allow the Commission to do that unchallenged will breed future political trouble and greater resentment by politicians and members of the public for European measures that they believe are remote from their national or local concerns. I hope that my hon. Friend will not rule out the possibility of seeking a legal opinion from the Council of Ministers and a possible challenge in the European Court of Justice on the treaty base.</span></p>
<p>12.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward O'Hara <span class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I agree with all the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North about the problems of waste disposal that we have experienced in Knowsley. The most recent furore has been in Knowsley, North, but in the southern part, we have a legacy of industrial pollution, which is due partly to the topology and meteorology of the region. The Minister might want to mark other areas as being of scientific interest. For example, yesterday's disaster in Ellesmere Port will have serious implications for many constituencies, including yours, Mr. Jones. We suffer pollution from the industrial complex along the south banks of the Mersey. However, we are discussing landfill, so I shall not talk about air pollution.<br><br>
We have considerable problems with pollution of topsoil, which is largely the legacy of former dirty trades, which have since gone. A constant battle that we fight in our area of high employment is that, because we are desperate for jobs, it is assumed that we will take dirty jobs at any cost and will become the dumping ground for pollution from jobs that are provided elsewhere. My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North mentioned Knowsley council, which has tried to protect our constituents when such planning applications are received.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley had a typical kneejerk reaction to the sensible suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North about having a levy to cover the costs of industrial pollution. It was more a question of principle than cost—the principle that the polluter pays. I wish that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley were here, so that he could respond to my riposte to his cheap jibe. We subscribe to the principle that profit does not come before workers' safety. Does he subscribe to the principle that profit comes before protection of the public? That is the issue in this debate, and its essence is the principle of subsidiarity.<br><br>
We in Knowsley have had bad experience of a local authority being overruled by the Government when it rejected planning applications in its laudable ambition to protect the public that it serves. If the Government put profit before public safety, that is bad news for the people of Knowsley and of the United Kingdom generally. There is a danger in subsidiarity. There are too many outstanding
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
concerns and unanswered questions for the motion to be approved by the Committee. That is why the Opposition must and, I trust, will oppose it.</span></p>
<p>12.10 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I compliment you, Mr. Jones, on the way in which you have chaired the Committee, and thank you for allowing me to speak again, as we have some time? I tried to be brief, as I was under the impression that the Committee wanted to divide early, but it seems that that was not the case.<br><br>
I take up the point raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), who referred to me. I find it ridiculous for anyone to say that mono-disposal is necessarily more expensive than co-disposal, and to support that claim with some of the weakest arguments that I have ever heard.<br><br>
The Minister made great play of the fact that the United Kingdom Government are the only Government who want to opt out of the directive. They stand accused before Europe of wanting the United Kingdom to be the dirty man of Europe. They say that in the past we had better standards. In paragraph 3.4 of its report of 21 July 1993, the Select Committee on European Legislaton stated that the intention
<br><blockquote><p>"was to harmonise the environmental and technical standards"—</p></blockquote>
which I assume means to bring them up to UK standards and then go beyond that—
<br><blockquote><p>"…to ensure a high level of protection for the environment, and particularly for soil and groundwater."</p></blockquote>
Anything that the Minister or Government supporters say on the matter is merely to cover the fact that the UK will be the only country in Europe that will allow or even encourage a less safe system, although that does not mean that there will not be breaches in other countries.<br><br>
There is no question but that if toxic and other waste is mixed, and if the associated risk becomes a fact, the consequences of that toxic mixture are unknown. As I said earlier, it is a matter of dumping and praying. If nothing goes wrong, it is fine, but if something does go wrong, it is not. If something goes wrong within 20 years, the clay layer and the polythene lining will be in place, but if the lining breaks after that, we do not know what will happen in 50 or 100 years.<br><br>
I am not in the House to cause unknown damage to the heritage that I leave to my children and grandchildren. I want the Government to impose regulations so that they can control the effects of their actions, even if that means that they are a bit more strict or—perish the thought—that the options are more expensive. When I hear people talking about the price of something, I always suspect that they are not interested in its value.<br><br>
The Government should get their heads out of—I was going to say out of the tip or the trough, but I realise that that has connotations about what they were doing in the trough, so I shall say out of the dump. They should realise—to continue the metaphor—that they would be blackened in the eyes of Europe if they took the step that they propose.<br><br>
I am cynical about the Government in relation to business. I wonder what proportion of the savings that would result from a softening of the regulations would end up as donations to the Conservative party in the run-up to the next election. I have every respect for the Minister and hear the good words said of him. I do not believe that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0493">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
takes account of such a consideration, but I note that it has been taken into account in the past in much that has happened in relation to the funding of his party.<br><br>
I mentioned the importance of Grangemouth, which is the site of the largest petrochemical complex in Britain. It is growing as, sadly, the petrochemical industry in Wales diminishes with the closure of the Baglan bay cracker. That means that the material presently going to Grangemouth from Zeneca, ICI, Rohm and Haas and GE Plastics will have to be disposed of. The development group there has decided to use not incineration, but landfill. That is not to say that it does not think incineration is technically better, but it has decided that it does not want to have to tackle people's fear of its risks.<br><br>
The directive is important for the industry, particularly in my constituency. The Minister said that whether a site is allowed or not is a planning matter, but it is not a planning matter whether a licence to run co-disposal or mono-disposal is granted. That will be affected by our attitude to the directive. If the directive is passed unchanged, no licences will be issued to introduce co-disposal into a new site.<br><br>
We consider that the risk is too high. We should start to think about the next century and following centuries. The Minister mentioned that we have been disposing of things for years. We have not been disposing of the sort of effluents and solid wastes that are produced by today's petrochemical industry.<br><br>
I am in daily contact with people in the petrochemical industry in my area, and they admit that products of their petrochemical processes have often had unexpected effects, even on their own plant. They therefore have great worries about how to dispose of their waste. In some cases, they take it by lorry to incinerators in other parts of the country rather than put it into landfill. They admit that if there was a local solution, they would use it, because transporting the waste is costing them about £500,000 a year.<br><br>
The motion would represent a softening of the attitude of the British Government. Companies would have an easy option; they could tell their shareholders that they no longer had to pay £500,000 to take the waste to Birmingham or Pontypool to be incinerated and they could dump it locally in a co-disposal site. I am sure that the shareholders would pressure them to do that.<br><br>
We should not allow companies to feel such pressure; we should give them a barrier—a bulwark—with which to resist it. Then they could say, "No, we can't put the waste in a co-disposal site nearby. We cannot use co-disposal, we must put it in a more expensive mono-disposal site." The directive would mean that co-disposal was not an option. People should have to consider not the money, but the real value of the environment and our children's future.<br><br>
My point about the boring rodents is important. In a co-disposal site, a cell is created, a liner is put in and it is lined with clay. Great play is made of the fact that Britain has a large supply of clay. My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South mentioned the need for inspections to ensure that the job is done correctly on the day. The public is deeply suspicious that standards are not maintained day to day, that the clay barriers are not thick enough and that the lining is not put down properly and smoothly. If it is kinked, it rots much more quickly and leakage into other parts of the site occurs. That is the reality of co-disposal which the Minister wants to sweep aside.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
It is a pity that the Minister did not make a longer speech when the motion was moved formally. I did not hear his introductory statement, so I do not know whether he covered any of my points then. Landfill sites—particularly co-disposal sites—near running water will have rodents that bore. When I mention boring rodents I was not speaking about members of our profession, but about small animals that burrow through clay and regularly bore into the layers of a dump site. They bore just as quickly through plastic or clay lining. The Minister says that the matter is a planning matter, but he admits that, in Scotland, it would be a matter for the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br><br>
Scotland is not a region; it is a country with a relationship with England and Wales following the Act of Union 1707. My worry about co-disposal is that even if the environmental health authority had reservations, the planning authority would be overruled by the Secretary of State who would say, "It is not legislated for in the British Government's decisions."<br><br>
Subsidiarity is about weakening support for the future of our people. I sometimes have the impression that the Government see the United Kingdom's people as a disposable item. In this century, our capitalists have put their money in other countries, leaving behind a much tarnished community and a greatly deprived environment.<br><br>
The Minister must realise that proximity to a site of special scientific importance is crucial in deciding how to comply with the directive. We cannot say, "This is an environmental health regulation question" and, "This is a planning question". The two are interlinked, but there was no sign that the Minister saw linkage. Without it, I have deep reservations about the weakening involved in much of what is proposed.<br><br>
A good point about minimising waste was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North. If there are pressures for mono-disposal, there will also be pressure to reduce the amount of waste that is to be disposed of and it will be in the interests of the industry to minimise it. I commend BP, Zeneca, Rohm and Haas and the rest of the companies in my constituency which regularly review their output of any form of effluent or solid waste. They seem to have more social responsibility than the Minister.<br><br>
I shall cite an example. I telephoned to discover what BP had done about an application for a landfill site in my constituency at Inveravon farm near Bo'ness and Grangemouth. Today, it announced that it would oppose an application by a developer to use that farm site for co-disposal of waste. In other words, it is saying that it wants nothing to do with such a site being used near its industry. That shows its social responsibility is greater than that of the Government.<br><br>
The only people who might go along with the Government are those in the disposal business who want to minimise the cost of dumping waste. However, they do not dump their own waste; they dump other people's waste. However, BP has stated that it would prefer that waste was not dumped in the sort of site that we are discussing.<br><br>
The Government should get up to speed with real industrialists in this country and take advice from them rather than deal with those at the shabby end where waste is not well disposed of because profits can be higher. That is a reality of the disposal of waste.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock, I pay a compliment to Mrs. Siobhan Samson and Dr. John Wheeler who are leading the Inveravon action group. They

have the total support of the community councils of Falkirk, Bo'ness and Grangemouth which join the petro-chemical industry in opposing the application for the use of Inveravon farm.<br><br>
If that developer succeeded with its planning application through the intervention of the Secretary of State, and if the Government took the line that they are advocating, it would bury a toxic mixture in the earth alongside the river Avon and the river Forth. However, no one, especially the Minister, knows what will happen to it 20, 30 or 40 years hence. The Government are asking us to vote for a motion that says, "We now have a standard that we like; we do not know what effects may occur in 10, 20 and 30 years in those waste disposal sites but we want the experiment to continue." The Government are like a mad scientist who keeps pouring more ingredients into a mixture while hoping that nothing will go wrong.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will divide and it is a pity that one of our colleagues is willing to support the Government. He should vote against them. The Government may succeed in getting the motion through, but I hope that such environmental groups as Friends of the Earth and the local groups mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock and others will continue to campaign to make the Government see sense.<br><br>
Dilution of the directive means danger for our children and grandchildren and the Government will be held responsible for that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard nonsense in my time, but the last contribution sums up some of the worries that my hon. Friends have about issues that are taken completely out of context and exaggerated to make points to protect the Labour party whose position on the matter is, frankly, unsound. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East said earlier that a Labour Government would not need to know the price of everything. That sums up the Opposition.<br><br>
As a responsible Government, we realise that pressure must be put on industry. However, we recognise that manufacturing industry, of which the Opposition make great play whenever they have the opportunity, has processes that sometimes cause problems. We must address those problems, but we cannot do that by adding £160 million to industry's costs. Nor would be suggest that the answer is regulation for its own sake.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that the Opposition believe that co-disposal is wrong and that Britain is the dirty man of Europe for having had that system for many years. The hon. Gentleman could not be more wrong. He made patronising remarks in response to a suggestion of mine that, because I am not a chemist, I do not take advice from experts in such matters. The experts are those who process waste and those who understand how the system works—as do many Ministers and officials in the European Community. They recognise that we have a firm and controlled system of landfill which has developed over the years under a series of Acts, the most recent of which is the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and which provide the pressures and controls, and an understanding of how the system works that allows us to speak with authority in Europe and not to be classed as the dirty man of Europe.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should have finished the quotation. My hon. Friend said that, unlike the Labour party, the Government knew the price of everything and the value of nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not what I understood him to say. However, what I said still obtains: we are worried about imposing costs on industry. We recognise the pressures on both sides, on both industrial and environmental grounds and we have to react to those pressures. It is easy for a party that has been in opposition for 15 years—and likely to remain so if it advances such theories—to make remarks that suggest that it does not understand the pressures upon Government and the reasons why Governments have to operate as they do.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and Opposition Members from the north have a saying: "where there's muck there's brass." There is nothing wrong with making money from clearing away waste and disposing of it. The first and most important recyclers were the scrap metal merchants, who made money by recycling metal. There is nothing wrong with making money from disposing of muck or waste. Indeed, one could argue that enlightened self-interest is a great motivator for change and efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Connarty</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister abuses his territory so much. When I studied the industrial revolution, I believed that the phrase to which he referred meant the dirt that came from the production of manufactured goods, not the disposal of the remnants of the process. The Minister should do better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee knows what I mean and will make its own judgment.<br><br>
Several issues have been raised, which I should like to deal with as quickly as possible. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East says that if we cannot be certain that it is safe, we should not do it. If that was the case, we should not make many decisions—in Government or industry or anywhere else. We cannot know that everything is completely safe. However, we can set stringent standards on how waste is disposed of, whether by landfill, incineration or by other methods. It is worth saying that we produce the waste—either as individuals or collectively through companies or local authorities and we must realise that that waste must be disposed of.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Knowsley, North spoke about a landfill levy. In answer to a perfectly legitimate intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley, he refused to say how much that would cost. It is essential to know what such things cost before decisions are made. I return to the earlier comment that a Labour Government would not need to know the price of everything. A Conservative Government would want to know. That is why we have tried to ascertain the costs. We are not in the business of placing burdens on industry for the sake of it, although, in terms of waste minimisation and waste management, pressures have to be imposed and we are quite prepared to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to make progress.<br><br>
Everyone automatically assumes that landfill is wrong and that, in relation to landfill, co-disposal, too, is wrong. Has anyone considered the problems of incineration?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0495">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
Incineration affects the upper atmosphere. When we burn waste—we cannot burn all the hazardous waste to which hon. Gentlemen have referred—the ash and residue from that incineration are also just as dangerous. Incineration is not always the answer. It has been suggested that co-disposal is environmentally unsound. I would argue that mono-disposal which as I said earlier, would have a separate disposal site that is properly monitered for an indefinite period, is more environmentally unsound. Co-disposal has been proved by technical experts to be a perfectly acceptable way in which to dispose of putrescent and toxic waste mixed together. I accept the point about leachate and liquor. It is also worth making the point that methane gas, when properly piped off as some of the landfill sites can do, can be used to create heat and power in a way that could not previously be done. We are re-using a gas that was formerly flared off and lost. The hon. Member for Knowsley, North has suggested that we are behind on every European directive, but that is not true. I draw his attention to a pilot scheme affecting millions of people in Germany. The cost of implementing the packaging directive has devasted the rest of Europe and has caused immense problems throughout. Initially, Germany was congratulated by some Opposition Members for taking an action that was supposed to be so good.<br><br>
Apart from the conclusion of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, which flew in the face of her earlier remarks—although I understand why she had to say it—I have much sympathy with what she said. With regard to the subsidiary point that she made and which I mentioned in my opening remarks, I have have ascertianed that other member states have agreed that the measure should be under article 130S and not under 100A. With regard to costs for a company, we carried out an exercise on a major company with a turnover of £1 billion which was spending £500,000 on waste disposal. The effects of the directive would increase that figure by £700,000 a year, which is by no means exceptional. Costs would be excessive, in addition to the other costs that I mentioned in reply to the right hon. Member for Strangford.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Thurrock for his kind remarks, which will be passed on. I understand his concern, but I believe that he went over the top in suggesting that we were not addressing those concerns. He has not considered the alternatives. He talks about the Government lacking zeal and I have tried to show that this is not true. We lead the way in Europe in many matters and I am proud of that. I can say that because although I am not the Minister involved, I have watched my colleagues in other Departments. The right hon. Member for Strangford will know that when I was a Northern Ireland Minister, we set some trends on waste disposal, waste minimisation and environmental matters. If the rest of Europe followed those, it would be doing extremely well.<br><br>
We do not take kindly to suggestions that Britain is the dirty man of Europe in this issue and others. We consulted widely, including businesses, regulators, the National Rivers Authority and, I understand, the Council for the Protection of Rural England. If the hon. Member for Thurrock believes that we have not consulted widely enough, I shall investigate that point. We have a regular consultation list, but as Friends of the Earth did not ask to be included, it is not consulted on a regular basis. If the hon. Gentleman's point is a fair one, I shall investigate it to ensure that that does not happen again.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the conditions of work for people involved in sites. He will know that such matters are for the Health and Safety Executive and not for me. We object not to the general controls in the directive, but to the specifics. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich referred to the effects of the subsidiarity argument right down the line. We are not against the essence of what is being proposed.<br><br>
We do not believe that co-disposal per se is wrong. No amount of argument that it is should be taken at face value. It has and always has had a part to play. It is a planning matter for local authorities and local companies to consider locally. If it were eventually called in by Ministers, an independent public inspectorate would consider the matter properly from both sides. I agree that the issue is a planning matter, and that it is perfectly fair for local authorities to take the stance that they want.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury referred to subsidiarity. I agree with what he said, and he was kind in supporting me in that respect. I hope that I have dealt with all the issues that were raised by members of the Committee. I ask that the proposal be pressed to a Division, if that is what hon. Members wish. I am clear in my mind, as I think are my hon. Friends, that the Government have an excellent record on waste disposal. The industry too has an excellent record because of the Government's legislation. The directive, as it is drafted, has weaknesses that we believe should be changed. The motion is the way in which to bring those changes about.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 5953/91 and 7506/93 and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Department of the Environment on 10 January 1994, relating to the landfill of waste; endorses the Government's view that the proposal is unnecessarily detailed and prescriptive and does not take sufficient account of the principle of subsidiarity which is enshrined in the Treaty of European Union; welcomes the Government's intention to press for the removal of a number of the more detailed provisions now that it is clear that other Member States wish to take forward the Directive; supports the Government's view that carefully controlled co-disposal is an environmentally sound practice, the banning of which in the United Kingdom would be detrimental to the environment and would lead to significantly increased disposal costs for certain types of industrial waste; and endorses the Government's intention to seek a common position in Council which would allow those countries who practise controlled co-disposal to continue to do so.</p></blockquote></p>
