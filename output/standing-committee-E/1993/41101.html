	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Transport of Animals</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mrs. Angela Browning)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to open the debate on such an important subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the matter of animal welfare there is, quite rightly, no subject of more concern to right hon. and hon. Members than the transportation of livestock. Most particularly, that concern has focused on consignments exported to other Community member states, a trade in which there have been several cases of insufficient attention to animal welfare, Frequently, those carrying animals have broken the rules on resting, feeding and watering and have not followed the journey plans declared before travel. Under current EC provisions there is an unacceptable lack of control and enforcement once animals reach the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an overriding need for the United Kingdom, together with other northern member states, to bridge the cultural divide and convince certain intransigent Governments that animal welfare is a subject worthy of concern and action. The proposed measure that we are debating today is central to those concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Directive 91/628, which is already in force, lays down some general welfare requirements for animals in transit. However, it does not address the key issues of feeding, watering and resting requirements and journey times, explicitly leaving such subjects to be covered in a further measure. To meet our concerns, such a measure must set the highest possible standards for livestock travelling in the Community and provide effective enforcement mechanisms on which we can rely to ensure that the requirements are observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will, I am sure, be aware of the state of play. The Commission's original proposal has been significantly modified as a result of discussions in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In June, a compromise proposal was on the table which, for adult animals, would have required watering to take place after 15 hours and feeding after 22 hours, following which a rest period would also have been necessary. The United Kingdom joined several other member states in withholding agreement to the proposal which, in our view, did not go far enough. In particular we wanted the Council to examine the possibility of absolute limits on journey length for animals travelling to slaughter, as was reported in our second supplementary memorandum on document 8441/93.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The German presidency made welcome efforts to take the subject forward, setting up a high level group of chief veterinary officers to identify ways of improving the June compromise package, especially on the issues of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
enforcement and journey limits. The group made some extremely useful progress on some aspects, but disappointingly little progress in other respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Luxembourg last week the Council of Ministers was again divided, depressingly, on the usual lines, and I cannot report that there is any new package or text on the table. Agreement appears attainable on tighter requirements on the training of those who transport livestock, as well as on the introduction of arrangements to license transport companies. That would mean that a member state in which companies were established would have the power to withdraw licences if those companies infringed the directive's requirements anywhere in the Community. There is no agreed new text on such matters and some member states still have problems, but there are signs that the ideas are at least negotiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The German presidency's initiative has helpfully enabled discussions to take place on absolute journey limits for slaughter animals.
<br><br><!-- lb --> Unfortunately, the discussions have confirmed that there is a fundamental divide among member states. Southern member states argue that they need to import live animals and that an absolute journey limit would cut off their supplies and close down slaughterhouses. Those member states comprise a substantial blocking minority and I foresee little likelihood of early progress on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, at least, some good news on UK concerns. A licensing requirement for livestock transport companies would be an important gain for the UK. It would help our problems with exports and we have pressed hard for it. However, we believe that discussion on journey time must continue, although it is evident that progress on that will be difficult. The German presidency has declared its intention of persevering in its quest for consensus and we shall continue to fight for the best achievable Community measures. Meanwhile, we shall also press ahead with our own plans to amend our domestic legislation to create offences that may be prosecuted in a British court when exporters fail to follow the export journey plan that they have declared to us. That will be a significant improvement, but it in no way alters the fact that, in the longer term, an effective and enforceable European Union measure must be the overriding priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now look to the resumption of discussions, probably initially at working group level. We need to bear in mind that failure to agree a Community measure during this German presidency is likely to result in a substantial period of inactivity at Community level. There is no doubting the overriding importance of securing an enforceable Community measure on the subject. There is a narrow window of opportunity to secure a satisfactory agreement during the German presidency, given that the presidency then passes on to France and, thereafter, to Spain and Italy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may now use the remaining time in the hour for short questions, I shall not say short answers because the Minister may not have short answers. The procedure is that hon. Members may ask questions until 11.30 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by welcoming the Minister to the Committee. This is the first time that I have had an opportunity to debate with her in Standing Committee A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
I have two short questions. First, will the Minister make it clear that the Ministry is committed to the concept of a maximum journey time and say whether that is a general maximum journey time or a maximum journey time for each species?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I very much welcome the points that she made about the enforcement of maximum journey times and prosecution for non-compliance, but she will be aware that some people who have been trying to arrange charter ships have been prosecuted for animal cruelty and irregularities relating to licences for exporting animals. Does she agree that such people, who have been found guilty of breaking the existing licensing laws, should not be allowed to hold a licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear that, in negotiation with our European partners, we are seeking an EC-wide agreement on maximum journey times for slaughter animals. That is on the table and we want to keep it on the table, but I must tell the hon. Gentleman that we have yet to convince certain member states of the concept of maximum journey times. I do not want to underestimate the difficulty of that task because some member states have yet to accept that simple concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of new proposals for transporting animals across the channel, whether by air or by sea, every proposal is carefully scrutinised and checked out and we go to great lengths to ensure that we are satisfied with it. Under existing regulations, the scheme must be assessed on the basis of the journey plan submitted rather than on the individual who proposed the plan. However, it will certainly help if we are able to achieve the aim—we are hopeful that we will—of introducing into British legislation the licensing of specific operators. But, at the moment, we must consider the journey plan, not the individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would a licence be a matter solely for the legislation of each member state or would we, for example, under the putative agreement that my hon. Friend the Minister described, have to recognise as valid a licence granted by the Italian or Greek authorities, or by any other member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One subject on which we made progress at the October meeting was the approval of the licensing of transport companies by member states. However, the proposal that has been subject to consultation by the UK Government is that approved operators would be able to suggest a journey plan for acceptance. If the operators defaulted, they would be brought before a court in the United Kingdom, regardless of whether they had defaulted in this country or abroad. That would place a question mark against their suitability to apply for and receive licences for future plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The motion states that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's intention of seeking to negotiate high standards of care".</p></blockquote>
That is good, so far as it goes, but that is like saying that sinners are, on the whole, a bad thing. Will the Minister tell the Committee in detail about the exact standards that the Government are seeking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are looking for higher standards of welfare through compliance with approved journey plans. Those plans will involve feeding, watering and resting of animals, and they will incorporate current legislation about the pre-inspection of journeys, to ensure that animals are properly rested and fed before a journey, and they will ensure that animals have been deemed by a vet to be fit and healthy enough to travel. More importantly, once animals have crossed the channel and journey through other countries—which is where most problems have been experienced—we should ensure that the journey plan has been put into effect. The plan should be approved, and checks should be made to ensure that each resting place on each part of the journey accords with the plan. The plan should be returned within 10 days of completion of the journey, so that one can check whether the plan has been followed. If it had not been followed, we should want the opportunity to bring the offender before the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall the embarrassment suffered by the Government and others when shipping firms recently decided not to transport live animals. They responded to animal lobbies better than the Government did. To talk about licensing is all very well, but every other area in the country that requires policing has had its staff reduced by the Government. How will the Government implement and force their regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that the decision by the ferry company operators was not a matter of embarrassment for the Government. The operators took a commercial decision, which they are free to do. The Government want to ensure that, however animals travel, they do so with a package of high-welfare standards that is recognised and enforceable. I said earlier that we want to bring the matter within UK law. That will require a statutory instrument under the existing Animal Health Act 1981, which should not be a lengthy process. Such enforcement legislation should be before the House very soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been some genuine horror stories, about which we are genuinely concerned. At present what happens on the other side of the channel is outside our courts' jurisdiction, and we want to bring operators within it. We also want to run, parallel to that, a more highly recognised standard of welfare in which others should be encouraged to participate. That would include the training of handlers and a recognition of how animals should be treated. There are many good companies doing such things at present. We want to get the cowboys and bring them before the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask three or four questions. I do not know whether I should declare an interest, given the atmosphere—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if you would ask your three or four questions on three or four separate occasions. We shall be having questions until 11.30 am. My we have your question number one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I shall now ask my starter for one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is rightly concentrating on welfare, but I want to ask the Minister to address the question of consumers' interest in the issue. I am sure that I am right in saying that if a cattle beast or a sheep has been slaughtered
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
close to the farm from which it came, and the meat has been well cared for and chilled at the appropriate moment, the final product is better from the consumer's point of view than if the animal has been transported over a very long distance in stressful circumstances. Has any research been done on that? What has been done about advising people living in the remoter parts of mainland Europe that they could obtain a better product if animals were slaughtered near the farm rather than at the other end of the continent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that research is being carried out into the matter both by veterinary establishments and, in the case of bovines, by the Farm Animal Welfare Council. The hon. Gentleman is quite right to point out that consumers are, of course, not interested only in welfare of animals that are used for meat. I think that this is a classic example of an issue in which the consumer could become more actively involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the problem is also of concern to farmers. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we took a unilateral decision to ban the use of veal crates in this country. It is quite abhorrent both to farmers who produce veal in this country and to consumers to find that calves reared in other countries in veal crates under conditions that we no longer use in this country come on to the meat market here in the United Kingdom. That is a good example of consumer preference—if we enable consumers to make informed choices at the butcher's or in the supermarket—having great influence. If people wish to buy veal but are concerned about animals being raised according to higher standards of welfare, the answer is not to buy veal from countries that do not share those high standards but to express a preference by buying British veal. I know that there are organisations, such as the Women's farming Union, the Ministry and others, which do their best to flag up that information, so that people can make informed choices at the point of sale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Returning to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), on page seven of the proposal for the Council directive it says that in relation to vehicles carrying livestock over a long distance for slaughter the correct conditions are rarely, if ever, respected. The Minister said that the Government will argue for an enforceable measure in the Council of Ministers—and they will be correct to do so—but what are the Government doing to ensure enforcement? Although the Government cannot do anything to enforce the measure on the continent, surely they can argue in the Council of Ministers that the European community should have measures in place to enforce the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point and I can assure him that we are pressing ahead for that enforcement to be agreed in an EC context. At present we have arrangements with two countries—France and Holland—which have been extremely co-operative. For example, I mentioned that journey plans must be validated and that inspection has to take place when the animals are over the channel, and we have received co-operation from France ahd Holland in this Matter. They will check out for us those parts of the journey where resting is expected to take place. Another helpful area of co-operation is as follows: when the journey plan proposal containing end destinations and resting points has been received, before authorisation is given for that journey plan we ask France
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
and Holland to check out those places actually exist and that there are facilities there for resting, feeding and watering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received a great deal of co-operation from France and Holland and, obviously, we want a wider EC system that will help enforcement throughout the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the point with the Minister that it is not just a question of passing a statutory instrument in this House, as the Minister knows? The question that I was trying to ask was, who will enforce it? Is the Minister really saying that our hard-pressed police, who are at this moment drowning under a wave of crime because of the Government's policies, will be able to find time to stop people travelling up and down the country with livestock? Who will carry out enforcement? Will inspectors be appointed? Are the Government going to beef up—if the Committee will forgive the pun—the enforcement regime in this country? It is unacceptable to ask the police to take on this burden when they have so much else to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Others are involved in checking the regulations: trading standards officers, customs officers and veterinary officers are all involved at various points in planning a journey, checking that the trade is legitimate and that it is complying with the plan. I was trying to make the point to the hon. Gentleman that, at present, once the transporters are outside British territory we have no remit. Even if we can prove that they have offended in France or elsewhere, we cannot bring them before British courts. They know that. We want to be able to bring them before British courts and to have the power not only to impose fines as a deterrent but to remove licences to operate. That would have a much greater effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend say a little more about the latest state of discussions regarding particular species? I understand that there have been disputes as to whether sheep need safeguards similar to cattle's, and that some specialist poultry breeders are concerned about their ability to send breeding stock from one country to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there is a recognition that different species are able to sustain longer or shorter journeys. That has been part of the continuing discussions at Community level. The poultry regulations are not new; they have existed for some time. Some regular carriers of poultry, especially those who use the normal transit and internal postal systems in the United Kingdom, have recognised recently that it is difficult to comply with the regulations on feeding and watering which have existed for some time. They have said that they cannot carry such stock because they are worried about being in breach of existing orders. That has presented an immediate problem which all interested parties are working on, to see how compliance can be met for poultry and other small animals who travel in that way. It is necessary to tighten up the regulations to ensure that they are fed and watered at appropriate times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have another question from the point of view of the producer. I suspect that I am not alone among British farmers in my horror at the thought of selling livestock at auction or to a dealer on the assumption that the stock will be slaughtered at a slaughterhouse not too far away, only to find that the stock is then transported to the other end of the European Union. Is there any way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of ensuring the enforcement of undertakings to farmers, to ensure that stock is slaughtered in the UK and is not put through such ordeals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that farmers feel strongly that their animals should not be used in that way, but once animals change hands, they are owned by another person. I am not aware of any legislation that gives the original seller the right to determine who the end purchaser in a chain will be, but I shall check and will write to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that during the past few weeks the James Whale programme, which stars the eminent Conservative politician, the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes), has broadcast some videos produced by Compassion in World Farming and showing abuse of animals in transit. Has the Minister seen those videos? If she has not, will she obtain copies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen them and I am sure the hon. Gentleman understands that my time for watching television is limited. My right hon. Friend and I had a meeting with Compassion in World Farming only two weeks ago, when we discussed animal transportation and welfare. A range of issues was raised and we had a constructive discussion. I do not know how many videos there are or how long they last, but I shall try to obtain a summary of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of the Minister having the gory bits cut out of the videos before she sees them is amazing. She is perhaps guilty of living in an illusory world in which the consumers have control over what happens to their food before it reaches them. Is she aware that the French seem to be unable to see the merits of British lamb? They prefer to slaughter our lamb in Paris and call it French lamb. Can the minister stop that deception of the French public so that our lamb is described as British lamb, raised and slaughtered here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scottish lamb.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that Scottish lamb is even better than the average UK product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are deceiving the public, and if we tightened the regulations we would help our slaughterhouses, which are not receiving beef for slaughter because it goes elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that in my duties at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food no one edits videos so that I do not see the gory parts. Yesterday I launched a video lasting one hour 20 minutes for the Humane Slaughter Association. Nothing is spared in the gory details. I could have watched only a few minutes of the video, but I watched all of it. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I want full information, regardless of whether it is gory or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to slaughterhouses and abattoirs in this country. Some abattoirs and butchery companies here are asking French butchers to come to the UK to demonstrate how they cut carcases. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that a carcase is cut differently in France. That is a welcome step. It means that the value-added element of the carcases remains in this country. However, it is not for the Government to decide in a legitimate trade who should or should not sell live animals.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the French like our lamb and beef. France is our biggest beef export market—we sell more beef to France than to any other country. We know that the French consumer likes to buy our product. I would not want to diminish that legitimate trade by the livestock industry. We want those animals that travel abroad live to be subject to the highest possible welfare standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has summarised the position well. Our standards are high. We believe that they are far higher than those in other European countries. We want a European-wide agreement to high standards to avoid the anomaly of our enforcing high standards as the animals leave the country and people ignoring them when the animals come under the jurisdiction of other countries. That is an important issue. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we want high standards throughout the Community; and if necessary, where we are allowed to do so, we enforce higher standards on a UK-basis. That is the purpose of my right hon. Friend's consultation document, which we hope to enforce fairly quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of enforcement, does the Minister agree that if we can convince the European Community that there have to be inspections and proper enforcement, it might be more attractive for the market to do as the Minister suggests and slaughter animals in this country and transport them as carcases? At the moment, the regulations can be flouted and it is more attractive to the market to transport animals live. Does she agree that whatever the regulations say, either now or in the new, improved version, enforcement is important; and that the Government have to press the European Community to devote more resources to it? There is no short cut.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Enforcement of the regulations will be important and we shall pursue that vigorously. However, I refer, Sir James to my opening statement. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is a cultural divide between the north and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
southern states of Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Another country at the October conference that was not supportive of United Kingdom's stance was France, which was a great pity. That is why I said in my opening remarks that time is of the essence. We must have an EC-wide agreement because, after the German presidency, the presidency will be handed to France. With that background, my right hon. Friend is doing everything he can to secure an enforceable EC-wide agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot be surprised that the Government are not finding many supporters among other members of the European union at the moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) raised the crucial issue of enforcement. There is no point in setting standards or making rules if they are not enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to training for drivers of vehicles that carry livestock, I should declare another interest as the owner of a heavy-goods vehicle drivers licence. There is nothing to stop me loading up a cattle float with livestock and driving it from here to Sicily without specialist training. Such a state of affairs is clearly unsatisfactory, and it is important that those responsible for the care of stock should be trained and should be aware that if they flout the rules, they could lose their licences or be prosecuted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly so, Sir James. The hon. Gentleman has outlined our policy exactly. I am not sure why he believes that we should be surprised that we have not had support in Europe among our Community partners. That must be a hidden agenda known only to him: it is certainly not obvious to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want high standards of training. We hope that training and the definition of competence among people who are employed by carriers and hauliers will be raised in profile—to the extent that, at the end of the day, those who do not comply are isolated and easier to identify. We shall examine every possible practical measure to ensure that training takes place and that there are benchmarks and qualifications for everyone who is involved in the transportation of animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister meant to, but I think, that she made a clear policy statement. I should like clarification. Could she confirm that she said that the Government would never countenance a policy that would prevent the transport of animals for slaughter and that the Government are not even considering a response to demands from the animals welfare lobby that only carcases for consumption should be transported? The Government seem to be ruling out one policy option entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The export of live animals is legitimate trade. We want standards of welfare for the animals concerned to be improved and monitored. People should be brought before the courts when they violate legislation and rules. We want standards in transport of animals for slaughter to be as high as those for the transportation of animals for any other purpose. That is our aim in the European Community. Our difficulty is that there is much resistence to the need to improve the levels and standards of welfare for those animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I return to that point? Does the Minister accept that many people—I am one of them—believe that animals should not be transported any distance for slaughter; that they should be slaughtered near to where they are sold so the meat is better; and that the quality product that people buy in the market should be what the farmers have raised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. May I take this opportunity to say that earlier I mistakenly elevated you, Mr. Hill? I am sure that it is only a matter of time before you are elevated, and I was getting in practice for when it happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people believe, for whatever reason, that animals should not be transported for slaughter at all. I am aware that a number of Opposition Members have signed an early-day motion to that effect. However, the transportation of live animals is a legitimate trade. Therefore, our aim is to raise the standard of welfare for those animals, whether they are for slaughter, breeding or fattening, because this is a very important industry. It is a matter for the market whether producers wish to encourage people to buy their animals on the hook or on the hoof.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that even if we took a unilateral decision to stop the transportation of live animals from this country to the rest of the European Community—and I am not suggesting that we should—such a move would simply be to the disadvantage of British farmers because the trade would still continue within the rest of the European Community? There is a large trade in live transportation from eastern European countries, where the standards are far lower than they are in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I should also tell him that if the Government banned the export of live animals, we should be in breach of the treaty of Rome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Harmonised policy throughout the European Union affects the movement and transport of animals in this country and animals that arrive in this country. We have various standards in operation which I have mentioned previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any negotiation there is an element of give and take, and there is a danger that the existing standards have, in most circumstances, begun to be eroded, despite the Government's best intentions. How many of the decisions that will be reached will require qualified majority voting, and how many will require the unanimity to enable us to lay down our conditions? If our standards were being eroded, would derogation be a possibility, as in the past, to allow us to retain our current measures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that when my right hon. Friend the then Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—now Secretary of State for Education—discussed this in June, she believed that the agreements could go further. That is what my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is now negotiating. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to tell the hon. Gentleman what the outcome of those negotiations will be; the meeting only a fortnight ago showed how difficult and protracted they are. We want to come to an agreement, but we do not wish to diminish the United Kingdom's high standards in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I must tell the hon. Gentleman that, ultimately, an agreement on an EC-wide basis is subject to qualified majority voting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks about the United Kingdom's high standards. Page 8 of the proposal for a council directive says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"animals must be able to stand in their natural position and, with certain exceptions, must be able to lie down at the same time."</p></blockquote>
Does the minister believe that those criteria are applied to all animals which leave this country to be transported for slaughter? If she does not believe that, what is she doing about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the journey plan is authorised and the animals are loaded, they must be verified by a vet as being well enough to travel, and the density and journey plan must be inspected. Therefore, the standards applying to stocking densities of different breeds of animals will be subject to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that I, and many other hon. Members, receive many letters regarding the transportation of live animals. There is great concern about their welfare. I am sure that the vast majority of us support the new rules and regulations being introduced throughout the European Community. But what assurances can we have that while we abide by them, the rest of the European Community will not follow the example of some member countries regarding many other rules and regulations? Italy and Spain, for example, simply ignore milk quotas, and behave as if they do not have the faintest idea what those rules and regulations are. What compliance will there be, and what assurance can we have that there will be compliance throughout the whole of the European Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point, which is at the heart of the difficulties surrounding the negotiations. There are member states, which I have named this morning, which have a cultural divide on the matter. It is not simply a question of everyone sitting round a table and agreeing how best to do something. Some member states need convincing that we need to do anything at all to the existing regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty of the negotiations is that we are trying to overcome a cultural divide as well as differences of opinion about how the regulations should be put into practice. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is rigorously pursuing this debate in the European Community, but we are up against some rather intransigent countries. I do not wish to underestimate the difficulty or complexity of the issue. We want to see progress, and we want to see it made quickly. However, there are difficulties as to whether countries that do not accept even the concept of what we are talking about will apply the rules. It is essential to have an EC-wide agreement whose regulations have to be applied uniformly in every country and for which the usual follow-up and enforcement can take place, but it is a difficult subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of any European Community plans for a proper labelling system to allow consumers to know whether an animal was slaughtered

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any such plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Every hon. Member knows, not least from their postbag, of the wide interest that there is in the topic. Can we ensure that, when the matter is dealt with in the Council of Ministers, we obtain the fullest possible report of what takes place there? If there is to be a written answer in 	<i>Hansard,</i> can we ensure that each qualified majority vote will be recorded and any unanimous votes also shown? Would it not be better for a report to be presented on the Floor of the House to allow us to respond to developments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the hon. Gentleman's last point, I am not in a position to authorise what he requests, but I shall certainly pass his views to those who take decisions about business on the Floor of the House. We are anxious that all hon. Members should be made aware of the progress of all negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not long before the end of the German presidency, so we hope that progress will be made in the next six to eight weeks. When my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is able to given the information to the House, whether the news is disappointing or—as we hope—good, I am sure that he will do so in the fullest possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that she knows of no plans for a European Community labelling system. Will she consider pushing for one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly examine any plans that go beyond the current labelling directives, but I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an assurance today that we would put such plans forward. In the United Kingdom there are voluntary schemes to make consumers aware of how animals are reared. I am thinking in particular of the scheme of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on red meats and labelling on the production methods for eggs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) asked about absolute journey times. The Government have referred the matter to scientific committees, one of which said, as page 5 of our document shows, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"poor welfare can be reduced considerably by slaughtering near the place of rearing and transporting meat".</p></blockquote>
The Government should consider the arguments for an eight-hour limit. It may be a somewhat arbitrary limit, but it would demonstrate to animal organisations the extent of the Government's wish to entrust animal welfare responsibility to those outwith our control. Most journeys from the UK would not then have to stop in a second EU country before reaching their destination. Have the Government seriously considered that, and what is their response?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolute journey times are part of the negotiations and the United Kingdom has pressed hard for them to be part of the package. But the matter must be seen in the context of a package and, as yet, no decision has been taken on it. It is one of the issues on which member countries find it difficult to agree—some have difficulty even with the concept of the need for an absolute journey

time. My right hon. Friend is negotiating on the matter. However, we have had no specific indication of whether the Community partners would perceive a specific number of hours as appropriate—so we are not very much further forward on the matter. But my right hon. Friend intends to keep it on the agenda in the negotiations between now and Christmas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is missing the point. What is the United Kingdom position? It is all very well to tell us how difficult it is to negotiate with other countries, and slight tinges of racism and scepticism can emerge in that debate. But what is the United Kingdom position? What is our response to the eight-hour limit that many organisations demand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The United Kingdom's view is that an eight-hour limit would have detrimental effects in the context of animals going from the United Kingdom to mainland Europe, and of transportation within the United Kingdom itself. Thus a limit of eight hours is not acceptable. However, that does not mean that we are reticent about wanting an absolute journey time to be incorporated in the package. My right hon. Friend has been negotiating on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8441/93 and the second Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 4th July 1994, and European Community Document No. 8128/94, relating to the protection of animals during transport; and supports the Government's intention of seeking to negotiate high standards of care for animals throughout the Community during transport—	<i>[Mrs. Browning.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.17 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The detail of the questions and comments from Members on both sides of the Committee demonstrates the tremendous concern about and interest in the issue of animal welfare among the British public—the people whom we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition recognise that the trade in animals for slaughter is legal, but whether it is a legitimate trade is, I think, more debatable. Surely it would be better for all—the producers, the consumers and not least the animals themselves—if we concentrated much more on slaughtering animals as near as possible to the point of production and adding value to them. At present, exporting live animals for slaughter also means exporting British jobs. The Government could legitimately examine that aspect. I recognise that it is a market system under the European single market. But the Minister knows the support and resources that Denmark, New Zealand and other countries put into marketing their products and adding value to them. I believe that there is a role for Government in such support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the Minster's point that, in debating animal welfare regulations, a European-wide standard must be achieved. That is important and we acknowledge that. We also acknowledge that there are cultural problems with how some countries regard animals. That is a difficulty. I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister's desire to achieve high standards in Europe. But we have heard that before from previous Ministers. From our friends in Europe, we know what is said at the Council of Ministers. We have clear information to the effect that, in the last Council of
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Ministers, Holland, Germany and Demmark were driving the issue of high standards. There was an impression, right or wrong, that our own Minister at the time was being pulled along in their wake instead of being at the forefront in arguing for high animal welfare standards. I hope that this Minister will rectify that by ensuring that our country is in the vanguard of campaigning and arguing for the highest standards in European-wide legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Commission is not due to report on the proposals until July 1995, which is a long period to wait for the regulations. The problem in this country exists now, and it stems from the ferry boycott. We all know why the boycott was inroduced: the ferry companies responded to the hostile reaction of their customers when they saw wagons of animals loaded on to the ferry decks alongside their cars. The ferry companies have rightly decided that the feelings of their customers are more important than the trade in live animals for export.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the ferry boycott is that some exporters have looked for new outlets. The Minister will be aware of the problems that that is causing. I have written to the Ministry drawing them to its attention. For example, calves are being flown from Humberside airport, and there is some confusion as to whether an airport board can legally ban the export of live animals. I know that the airport board is trying to clarify its powers. There is also much concern on Humberside—I do not know why Humberside seems to be a centre of the trade—about the export of sheep from Grimsby and the arrangements made for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said before, there are anxieties that some of the people involved in earlier applications for the export of live animals did not have a good record and that they had been prosecuted for cruelty-related offences. We have a serious problem in this country that needs to be dealt with nationally. That is in addition to the European issue, which, of course, we cannot ignore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stafford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We agree that it is essential to provide for as humane treatment of animals as possible, but does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the actions taken by the ferry owners are serious because they have a monopoly on travel between ports on the continent and in the United Kingdom? We must therefore consider whether the ferry companies are restricting competition and are using a monopoly in an unfair and unreasonable manner, given the representations that farming communities have already made to the Minister. It is a much more serious question than the hon. Gentleman concedes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the importance of the hon. Gentleman's remarks about monopoly, but I disagree with them. There are a number of ferry companies and the main ones have taken decisions. They did not all take them at the same time. Ultimately, those decisions were consumer driven. It is ironic that the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) complains about the way in which the market operates and the way in which consumers have driven it, but it is a fact of life that livestock exporters must recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Livestock operators have the freedom to charter ships and aeroplanes, and are doing so. However, when they apply to the Ministry for a licence to charter such transport, it is important that the Ministry ensure that the people involved are qualified to carry out the exports properly and are following proper standards. That is a problem for our national Government and it is separate from the European-wide regulations. It has not been tackled because the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
position is changing fast. I hope that the Minister will consider that issue carefully because there is widespread concern about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I inform the hon. Members for Stafford and for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) that I have heard the arguments of the producers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East said, not all livestock producers believe that live exports are the means by which this country can develop a strong export trade. Many of the producers want added value and a carcase trade. The argument that a ferry ban would bring about a collapse of prices and disaster to the livestock trade has not proved true. Prices have, in fact, held up quite well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The live export trade for slaughter has demonstrated itself to be a trade of low aspirations. I should have thought that British producers' aspirations might be somewhat higher with regard to adding value in this country and improving our export trade. British lamb and beef are good products. We should be exporting by relying on price and quality, not simply by putting live animals on transporters and dragging them through the continent. I am not convinced that that trade would be replaced by cheaper eastern European live animal imports, because quality is an issue too. I am sure that French consumers would quickly notice the difference between British lamb and poorer quality eastern European lamb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not be so defeatist about this trade and its importance. It should be borne in mind that 80 per cent. of trade in lamb is already a carcase trade. A small proportion of the trade is live—although people are rightly concerned about the fact that it is increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document that we are considering has been superseded. We discussed it in June 1994 and it was amended at the Council of Ministers because agreement was not reached. Some of the proposals in the document weaken existing United Kingdom standards. I hope that the Minister will assure us that, whatever the outcome of the matter in the Council of Ministers, no agreement will weaken existing British standards. We want those standards to be improved, if anything, not weakened in the interest of getting a deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the information of the hon. Member for Stafford, 1.8 million animals were exported live from the United Kingdom in 1992. That was an increase of more than 500,000 animals on the previous year. Sadly, there are no official statistics for 1993, and perhaps the Minister might like to attend to that, but trade sources estimate that around 2 million sheep and 500,000 calves were exported abroad—another significant increase on the previous year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party welcomes improvements, such as the inclusion of sheep and goats—which in the original documentation were excluded—in welfare plans for feeding and watering, and the reduction of the feeding and watering intervals for adult cattle, and of the feeding intervals for lactating cows and pigs. Those are all welcome steps forward. I know that these matters are all included in the negotiation at the Council of Ministers. However, we certainly do not welcome the fact that we are still a long way from deciding a maximum journey time. We are pleased that the Minister has expressed support for the concept of a maximum journey time, which is an improvement on what we have previously heard in this Committee, but Labour Members prefer a target figure of eight hours. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
would allow animal transportation needs to be met inside our own borders, yet it would minimise the stress suffered by animals through transportation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members also recognise, as, to be fair to her, does the Minister, I believe, that animal transportation presents a serious problem. The explanatory memorandum from the Commission to the President of the Council of Ministers stated that the current rules were being "systematically flouted" and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"overstocked vehicles, combined with dehydration and starvation results in poor welfare and often in high mortality."</p></blockquote>
That is the Commission's view about how live animal transport is now being undertaken. We have not moved far towards dealing with those problems—which everyone has acknowledged—by introducing realistic maximum journey times. We are a long way from achieving them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cash</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On two occasions the hon. Gentleman has said that the problem is somehow a British one. In fact, as he said, the European Commission instigated the proposals, but according to my information, many British exporters of animals—farmers and other producers—find that under the contractual arrangements into which they have entered, they deliver the goods in reasonable condition. Practices begin to go wrong when they arrive on the continent—I know of several such examples. Furthermore, the situation can become serious because of the failure to hold proper inspections and to obey the rules which are being prescribed. That problem arises, for example, in France and Belgium and with articulated vehicle owners throughout the continent far less often than with British owners of such vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree that there is a problem in terms of enforcement in Europe once the vehicles leave this country. That problem will not be solved by the journey plan proposal—although it is a good idea—of transshipping, which entails a British exporter taking the animals to a particular lairage on the continent, then loading them on to another vehicle and trans-shipping them somewhere else. That problem has yet to be resolved. We acknowledge that there are serious problems which are of a European nature. That is why a European directive on this subject would be welcome, as long as it is strong and has some real teeth to make it work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples in Britain of overloading, poor treatment of animals and of irregularities which sometimes break national United Kingdom law. I saw a study by Birmingham city council, which did a number of spot checks on animal transporters which were moving through its area. The council found that a high proportion were overloaded according to the guidelines. We have problems within our national community and we have existing national law to deal with them. It is question of enforcing that law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposals for the journey plans and for licensing—the Labour party has been in favour of it for some time—which could possibly be linked with a national registration scheme, so that there is some control and a way of ensuring training, which my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) rightly mentioned. An appropriate condition of the licence, for example, would be that those who are moving the animals have appropriate training and experience in the transport of live animals.

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
We believe that it is important to set standards for matters including training. We support the feasibility of registering loading vehicles that export live animals. We welcome the new directives concerning the Welfare of Animals during Transit Order 1992, which the Government introduced. We recognise that that order gives the Government powers to take criminal action against hauliers who breach the standards in terms of the journey plan. However, as the Minister has confirmed, there is still the problem of people who can still continue to be involved in the live animal export trade even though they may have been prosecuted on more than one occasion. Perhaps the Minister will consider suspension of licences for a period commensurate with the individuals' transgression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also believe that slaughter should be carried out as near as possible to the point of production. The number of red meat abattoirs in England and Wales fell from 780 in 1989 to 473 in 1993. That is a reduction of 39 per cent. and many jobs and much investment have been lost as a result. That reduction is not due only to live animal exports, and I do not pretend that exports are the sole reason: there are a number of reasons. Nevertheless, it is not coincidental that the huge increase in live animal exports has gone alongside the decrease in the number of abattoirs in the country. A greater spread of abattoirs is much better, not only interms of rural employment, but also for the animals' welfare, because they are not transported as far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry ought to have a close look at the principle of mobile abattoirs. Rather than transporting live animals long distances, more remote areas could use mobile abattoirs which meet the appropriate EC standards and which would slaughter the animals on the farm and remove the carcases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The labour party totally opposes any proposal to scrap the minimum value order in relation to the export of live horses for slaughter. I know that the Ministry has been strong on that. We regard it as an important issue, as do the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party wants to see an effective, Europe-wide enforcement of animal welfare measures. Those measures should not be subject to subsidiarity because of the problems we have discussed here. There is a need for proper enforcement and common standards so that in what is ultimately a commercial activity some states do not derive unfair advantages by not enforcing proper standards to the same level that we, the producers, and the consumers in this country certainly want.

We have already discussed consumer labelling. Consumer choice should not just be left to voluntary schemes, welcome though they are. I pay public tribute to
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the Freedom Food scheme as a pointer in the right direction. But I do not see why the Government could not introduce under our national law a scheme of labelling that makes the origin of a food clear and shows the production methods used. In the end, consumer choice is a powerful weapon in bringing about change both in this country and in Europe. We see an example of consumer choice and consumer pressure in the ferry ban. It is important for the government and all politicians to recognise that concern, to insist upon high standards and to ensure that the European directives are not inferior to our domestic rules—and are preferably a great deal better. We want to move towards a maximum journey time of eight hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr David Liddington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. I have two or three points that I should like to make. First, I should like to echo a comment made by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe. It would be difficult to persuade the general public of the case for a common European regime on the shipment of live food animals if the rules agreed at European level led in practice to a reductiion in the safeguards currently provided under British domestic law. The Minister spoke about there being a window of opportunity during the German presidency. Knowing which countries that will succeed to the presidency after Germany, I acknowledge that she was right to use that phrase. But she should beware lest a window of opportunity turn into a defenestration. I am sure that British Ministers are well aware of the strength of public feeling in this country and that they are determined to do their very best to see the wishes of the British people fulfilled at European level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that I do not believe that we shall get a satisfactory answer to the problem until there is a cultural change in the southern European nations. One can achieve agreement on common rules for the EU and we should strive continually to achieve that objective, but then one is inevitably drawn to ask about the extent to which any European rules will be enforced in practice at local level in those countries with an attitude towards animal welfare different from ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I agree with both my hon. Friend the Minister and Opposition Members about the importance of labelling. I hope that my hon. Friend can assure the Committee that nothing in the single market would prevent a food retailer from showing clearly the country of origin of the meat that he or she is selling. This is an important area where we in Britain can at least harness consumer pressure to bring about patterns of purchase which support both good animal welfare practices and the purchase of more British meat rather than meat from other European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments Does he agree that labelling is not simply a question of consumer interests in this country? One-week-old calves are being loaded on to old eastern European military transport planes at Humberside airport, flown to the continent and put into veal crates which are, quite rightly banned in this country. Does not the hon. Gentleman wonder, as I do, why we are not exporting British veal which is produced in humane conditions, and labelling it at humanely produced veal and taking on the Europeans ii their own market? I am sure that there must be a market in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Holland and Germany for consumers who want their veal produced to high standards. Yet nothing is being done in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree very much with the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. My only reservations are with regard to the practical enforcement of such measures. Unless there is a clear ruling in the domestic law of individual European states or at European level about what can properly be described as meat produced by humane procedures, competitors on the continent could simply stick a label on to their own veal, saying that it was produced humanely, even though such a description would not stand up to an objective test. There would have to be some arrangements, at supranational or national level, to ensure that such cheating could not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On enlargement, if the four countries considering accession to the European Union all join, that alone will greatly enlarge at least the potential for significantly longer journeys for live food animals within the Union. I hope that that matter has been taken on board in the discussions. I hope also that Ministers will bear in mind the point raised by the hon. Minister for Glanford and Scunthorpe about trans-shipment. As the European Community seeks to expand its membership eastward, such a question will come increasingly to the fore. I should not want that sort of medium-term difficulty to prevent ministers from reaching an agreement now for a Community of 12, if that is within our grasp during the German presidency. However, it seems that whatever happens during the next few months, that longer-term problem will rear its head as we tackle EC enlargement into central and eastern Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish my hon. Friend well; I am sure that she will be wielding the handbag doughtily on behalf of British interests and the interests of animal welfare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been a great pleasure to listen to the Minister in a new role. She has obviously studied the subject very well, and I am always impressed by a Minister who takes her brief seriously. She has shown all the skills that are necessary not to answer the questions when asked, which will obviously take her far in the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not actually any great difference in how people feel about the issue. I started a branch of Advocates for Animals in my constituency in the centre of Scotland before I became a Member of Parliament because it seemed that we could judge the humanity of the society in which we lived by how we treated the dumb animals in our care. In the farming community particularly, the farmer who looks after the cattle and animals in his care is usually better at selling the product. He has a closer ability to convince people of the quality. The two things go together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great concern in this country and in the European Community about the whale and about seal culling. Yet it would appear that, in that matter, market forces rule, whether those are the Common Market forces that concerned some of us when the European Union began, or the market forces that have driven this Government into such disasters in their policies. Early-day motion 1641, which was mentioned earlier, had 94 signatures. It called for an eight-hour ban. I hope that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
was not signed only by Opposition Members and that some people on the Government Benches had the courage to put their names to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have a benchmark. The Minister did not manage to slip out of answering questions on two parts of Government policy. She said that they have no intention of introducing a ban on transport for slaughter. That might do them no good in the polls because many people want that policy to be adopted, and I admit to being one of them. Many people believe, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glandford and Scunthorpe said, that we can win in a market where we sell good-quality slaughtered beef, lamb and other animals to other countries. We do not have to sit back and take the cheap option of selling on the hoof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that there were no absolute limits yet fixed by the Government on which they were going to argue. They were entering a fluid situation, hoping to win something. She mentioned considerations, such as watering after 15 hours and feeding after 22 hours. Ask any farmer whether he would water his cattle or sheep 15 hours after their last water, or feed them 22 hours after their last feed. A farmer doing that consistently would be in court for animal abuse. A Conservative Member of Parliament has been in court for animal abuse so perhaps the Conservatives have some sympathy with such people. [An HON. MEMBER: "Sheep abuse."] Sheep abuse! That reminds me of a joke. In certain parts of the country two sheep tied to a lampost are referred to as a leisure centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of a journey plan being enforceable is a joke. I shall say one word to remind the Minister how much of a joke that is—tachographs. Tachographs are supposedly enforceable on all lorry journeys, giving a record of how fast the lorry went, when it stopped and so on. It is a fact that in this country that measure is not enforceable. In many accidents, including a terrible one in my constituency in which a constituent's daughter was killed, the tachograph was mysteriously missing because it was in for repair—the law allows that. The same will happen with journey plans. There will be all sorts of excuses and the trade will find ways round them. The only way to deal with the problem is to make the requirement so hard and fast that it will be impossible to get out of it. It would be simplest to ban the excuses all together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Early-day motion 1641 was signed by 94 Members, including myself. It is not just a matter of saying that we have an absolute vision and that the Government should come into our world rather than deal with the one in the European Union. The early-day motion urges the Prime Minister to raise the question of the limits of animal transportation at the next prime ministerial meeting. People think that the abuses exposed by organisations such as Welfare in World Farming are very important and they want something to be done about it. If that means a compromise which does not involve a total ban or a restriction of eight hours, there is a will on both sides of the House to view that as at least a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the farmers' plight. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian said, when a farmer sells in the market it is partly to pay ever-increasing bills. With the changes in the hill livestock compensatory allowances and the sheep premiums it is becoming more difficult for farmers to cope with the burden of running a farm. They sell in the hope that the animal will be slaughtered nearby, but with no guarantee of that. There is a growing fear that the animal will be taken and stuck in a transporter, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
will probably be overloaded and in which it cannot lie down. I ask the Committee to try to think of a type of transport on the road which has enough room for animals to lie down. That is not the reality of what is seen on our motorways. The animals are packed in; clearly they cannot he down and they are often jammed in so tightly that the present British regulations are broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who are in favour of an absolute ban have sympathy for the farmers because they have to make a living. Often, after two years of fattening their sheep or cattle, farmers have to sell them in order to try to pay their bills. I believe that the Government are letting those farmers down by saying that the market will take care of the matter. In fact, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe said, we could challenge the mythology that we cannot slaughter our cattle and sheep here, then sell the meat as a high quality product to people throughout the European Union. I am told the Government hold a small kernel of that vision in their theories and that kernel may grow; the Government may start to speak of high added value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A deception is being perpetrated in most of the European Union. A well-known example is that of the French, who slaughter our lambs and sheep and then call it French lamb and mutton. We let them get away with that. We do not challenge or attempt to stop it. We do not try to ensure that they can sell as French meat only that which comes from animals that are reared in France as well as slaughtered in France. Eventually, I hope, the Government will say that there is their market, which has been a flawed market ever since it was called the Common Market, and there is our market, and we believe in high added value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not take the easy road out, but look for the better road. Hopefully, that argument will incorporate both their philosophy and our philosophy and it will chime with the British people, who want animals to be treated humanely. If that makes producing meat more difficult, we must take on those difficulties, face the challenge and defeat those people who wish to undermine our product by selling high value products that bear a label that says, "this is British" or, in the case of sheep, "this is Scottish and it is the best in the world."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a farmer myself, but I represent many farmers in my constituency. I agree with much of what was said by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East, especially his remarks regarding the "fraud" that is being perpetrated on the French people by calling mutton or lamb French when the animals have obviously been imported for a few months and then slaughtered in France. As the hon. Gentleman said, we let them get away with it and we should not because the French immediately jump on our backs if they think that we are not complying with particular rules. They get very picky about what we should call chocolate or ice cream and therefore we have a right to consider what should be called French and what should be called British. We must examine the issue and see if we can bring any pressure to bear in order to eradicate the problem. If the French have a problem with eating British lamb or beef, that is their problem and they should not be allowed to continue to get away with deception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about the massive cultural problem with other European Union countries and I acknowledge the existence of that problem. I am sure that they look at
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
us and think that we have certain cultural problems, but we should not allow them to get away with it as they have been. We shall continue signing up to directives, left, right and centre, and because we have enforcement structures in place in this country we shall comply with whatever we sign up to. There is nothing worse than to speak with farmers or business people in one's constituency and to hear them say that it is unfair that they have to comply with rules and regulations which cost them money, yet when they go abroad to the continent, they see at first hand that other countries are not complying rigidly with directives that they signed up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must examine compliance and ensure that, when an agreement has been established, it is not only this country that spends money and not only our farmers who incur costs, but that other countries and their farmers incur the same costs. It is all very well signing an agreement, but we must ensure that there is fair compliance throughout the European Community. Otherwise, it will disadvantage farmers in this country. But, even if we are unable to reach full agreement, the fact is that we have better standards for the transportation of live animals than many other parts of the European Community. I am sure that no member of the Committee would suggest that we should depart from our high standards in order to reduce our costs to the level of those incurred by the rest of the European Community. We must maintain those standards and do all that we possibly can to ensure that standards are raised throughout the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen cultural changes taking place over many years. There are far more vegetarians in Britain than there used to be. Who can say whether, in 10 years' time, the transportation of livestock will end because of the politically correct culture that is overtaking us? In 10 years' time, the carcase trade, which forms the majority of trade between this country and the European Community, might be the only trade that takes place because people may not wish to see livestock transported, but that will take time. It is not something that we can legislate for at the moment. As the Minister said, it would be contrary to the Treaty of Rome for us to do that unilaterally and it would be foolish for us to do so while trade is coming in from eastern Europe. We must also pay heed to the ferry ban, which has already been mentioned. The problem is that animals continue to be transported, but, in some cases, they take longer to arrive at their destinations. So we must consider the consequences of the ferry ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the cessation of trade, we must have regard for the livelihoods of abattoir owners, who have been through a tough period following the introduction of new rules and regulations with which they must comply. One abattoir owner in my constitutency is faced with an extra bill of £20,000 a year. He owns only a medium-sized abattoir but, suddenly, he must find another £20,000 a year from his profits to be able to keep his abattoir going. Many small abattoirs have had to close because of the extra costs. It would help small abattoirs to have more trade passing through. Small abattoirs will benefit if, eventually, there is a cessation of trade in live animals for slaughter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of labelling, bacause more people are interested in the welfare of animals, I would have thought that they would want supermarkets and butchers to state where their meat comes from, whether the animals travelled great distances and how they were killed. Many people now eschew meat that has gone through a tortuous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
journey to get to the dinner plate. There is market demand for more information so that people can make more informed decisions about the meat that they buy. Finally, irrespective of the meat labelling, British meat is the best. One only has to go to the countryside to see the environment in which our meat is produced to know that, and we also know of the dedication and skill of British farmers. I would prefer British meat sold in France to be labelled "British" rather than to be sold under any other label.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first European Standing Committee that I have attended and it has been an interesting and worthwhile experience. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East in complimenting the Minister for the capable way in which she has responded to questions. I hope that she will recognise that strong representations have been made, from both sides of the Committee, by Members from rural and urban constituencies about the important subject of the transportation of live animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe mentioned the dramatic reduction in the number of slaughterhouses that operate in the United Kingdom. As I understand it, that cut has largely been because of the high cost of raising slaughterhouses in the United Kingdom to the European Community's high standards. That has been a painful exercise for the operators of slaughterhouses, who have had to spend much money so that they can have access to the mainland European market for meat. It is absurb that, having made those improvements, we are still indulging in the primitive and crude business of exporting livestock on the hoof, so that animals can be slaughtered at premises at the other end of the European Community, which may not be up to the same standard as our own. There is an inconsistency in the way that the Common Market has dealt with the market for meat. The Minister may care to consider that matter in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about the cultural differences between the north and south of Europe, particularly about people's attitudes towards animals. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley said that people in southern Europe might be critical of our cultural attitudes to animals—and rightly so. There are major differences in the pattern of agricultural production; there are fewer extensively reared grazing animals in southern Europe, for obvious reasons. It is hotter in southern Europe than northern Europe, and there is less rainfall, so people from the south might not be as familiar with the livestock that we have been talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to realise that if people from southern Europe feel that they are being browbeaten by arrogant politicians from northern Europe—who might say that the southerners are primitive and get things wrong—they will react negatively. There are better ways of persuading people that better practices are available. One way is to use influence of the market, to use one of the Government's arguments. If southern Europeans discovered that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
could buy meat that had been slaughtered close to the point of production—whether England, Scotland, Ireland or northern Europe—and transported cheaply, on the hook in chilled containers, to southern Europe, they might realise that such practices were not such a bad idea after all. Why not use the market argument to overcome the problem? A persuading job needs to be done. Politicians and the animal welfare lobby might consider the way that they go about persuading people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my travels during the recess, while I was driving a lorry all the way from Edinburgh to Yugoslavia—during the journey, by the way, nobody checked by tachograph—I was surprised to see advertising material in motorway service stations in Germany campaigning against the transportation of live animals over long distances. Pressure is building up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission needs to take an overview of transportation policy. I hope that it will take a lead and make constructive recommendations to Governments. New regulations should enforce tolerable standards for the transportation of animals. I can think of no one better to do that than the new European Transport Commissioner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward O'Hara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask you, Mr. Hill, to bear with me, I apologise for arriving late in Committee, and for not asking any questions. I had a previous engagement, as Chairman of the Committee next door, and I did not wish to burden you, Mr. Hill, or the Committee, with questions that might have been asked already. I am perhaps the last member of the Committee to speak before the Minister, and I can be brief, largely because other members have covered many points. In particular, my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe, gave a masterly overview of the main issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on her obvious mastery of the brief, which enabled her with equal competence to give both straight answers and deflections. I want to comment on what I regard as the shortsightedness and futility of the system of transporting live animals for slaughter under current conditions. Several of my colleagues have pointed out that the system exports British jobs. Reference has been made to the closure of small abbatoirs in rural areas and to reduction in meat quality. Overheads are driven up, inflated by the number of casualties en route. Consequently, even more animals are packed in to cover overheads. A vicious circle is created which, ultimately, is futile. I wish that more people would stand back and realise that it is not a straight choice between the transport of live animals for slaughter as fresh meat near to consumption on the hoof, and frozen meat on the hook. There is a middle road that one should consider: the attraction of a market in freshly slaughtered meat on the hook. Such meat could be distributed to all parts of the European Union by modern techniques of transport and refridgeration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with those of my colleagues who suggested that the way forward is to estabish maximum journey times and labelling systems. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian has suggested that that would introduce market forces into other parts of the European Union. That might confine their predilections to their own market, but it might open their eyes to the attractions of better quality and cheaper alternatives, as well as to opportunities of markets
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
beyond their own. However, that could only work if terms were governed by strict rules on journey times and labelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ultimately, I hope that other countries can be persuaded that such legislation would be good for their rural economies. No rural economy would benefit from it more than ours. Although I represent a Merseyside constituency, some of my constituents, like those of the hon. Member for Ribble Valley, are fanners, and I have a small abattoir that suffers in the same way as the hon. Gentleman suggested. We need to encourage our rural economies. Farmers are not the only people living, operating and surviving in those rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous speakers in our debate have urged the Minister to press for strict maximum journey times and for her to be a little more enthusiastic than she has earlier suggested that she is about a system of labelling. If those aims cannot be achieved now, we urge her to look to the accession of more members from northern Europe into the European Union to achieve that happier state of affairs as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for a constructive debate on an emotive subject. We have covered the more practical aspects of how progress can be made in solving the difficulties and problems that we have encountered with animal transportation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of enforcement has been raised many times this morning. Whatever improvements are made to regulations, it is important that they are enforceable, both with our proposals in the United Kingdom and, more importantly, on an EU-wide basis. Our first step is to ensure that the requirements are agreed so that they are applicable throughout the Community. Next, we need tighter obligations on enforcement written into the regulations. We are all aware that it is all very well to have regulations written down, but practical enforcement is often a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we have achieved that, it is important to get member states to act by establishing bilateral contracts. We must also press the Commission inspectorate to play an active role in ensuring that the regualtions are properly enforced and to oversee that enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A licensing system for transport companies is also important. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe mentioned existing cases of companies with a
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
bad track record. I repeat my reassurance that, though current regulations do not enable us to take action, in our proposed reforms for the United Kingdom we want to be able to point the finger and act against individuals or the licensing of their companies rather than simply look at the journey plan as we are now obliged to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have mentioned labelling. As I have said, existing legislation does not enable us to enforce or insist on country of origin or methods of production, but I assure the Committee that I will examine the matter in a Euro-wide context, as several hon. Members requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe also mentioned trans-shipment. It is a problem, but the 1991 directive requires the Commission to lay down detailed requirements on facilities and activities in the staging posts at various points on the journey. Although trans-shipment is not the main purpose of the directive, it could be covered under the regulation. We have pressed for that and will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined to stand our ground and achieve measures that will set the highest possible standards for animal welfare in transportation. Tighter enforcement measures are critical and we shall seek tough sanctions that we shall be determined to use and that we shall require others to apply to ensure that the necesary standards are observed. I assure hon. Members that my right hon.
