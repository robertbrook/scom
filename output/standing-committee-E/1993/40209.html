	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Nicholas Soames)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg, for giving me the opportunity to move the motion and say a few words on this important and sensitive issue of bovine somatotrophin. That is the last time that I shall use its full name today. I shall stick to BST from now on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering today the Commission's communication of 23 September 1993 to the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which is the subject of explanatory memorandum 8757/93. In addition, the Committee has recommended that we consider the Commission's subsequent formal proposal of 15 December for a long-term prohibition of BST, which is dealt with in explanatory memorandum 10761/93.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I begin, I should like to apologise to the Committee for the delays in submitting the explanatory memoranda on this subject and for the necessity to act in Brussels in advance of the scrutiny process being completed. These delays arose from the Ministry's efforts to ensure that the memoranda were correct and entirely up to date. Unfortunately, the issues raised are fundamental and needed the most detailed and careful consideration, while events—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I think that the Minister is moving the motion and making his speech in connection with it, rather than giving us a few introductory remarks to allow us to embark on the hour's Question Time that is available. If it is a longish speech, that will reduce our opportunity to question him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was invited to make a statement. He may have said that he is moving the motion. In fact he is making a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's assistance. I shall continue by explaining to the Committee why it did not have the papers that it should have had earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These delays arose, as I said, from our efforts to ensure that the memoranda were correct and up to date. Unfortunately, the issues are fundamental and needed careful consideration while events were moving quickly and the situation was changing from day to day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon. Members that any failure to discharge our responsibilities to the House arose not from any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
disrespect but from our efforts to get things right and avoid any possibility of misleading the Committee. Clearly in future we shall submit a holding explanatory memorandum in such difficult cases, to ensure that the House is kept informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it appropriate to take this opportunity to bring the Committee up to date on recent events which form the background to this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may be aware that the moratorium on the sale and supply of BST was due to end on 31 December 1993. The Agriculture Council was asked to consider at its December meeting the Commission's formal proposal to extend the moratorium for the duration of the milk quota system, currently until 31 March 2000. As my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reported to the House after the European Council on 17 December, the Council did not accept the Commission's proposal but agreed a presidency compromise to extend the existing moratorium for a further year until 31 December 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The compromise was linked to a declaration that the Council would use this period to consider the implications for international trade following the general agreement on tariffs and trade agreement and the new situation created by the decision of the United States regulatory authorities to approve the marketing of BST from the beginning of February 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts about the history of the consideration of BST are set out in the Scrutiny Committee's report. But the key points are that BST is a naturally produced hormone, present in small quantities in all cow's milk. It is a stimulant to milk production, and technological developments in recent years have made it possible to manufacture commercial quantities of substances identical in activity to natural BST. These fall within the definition of a medicinal product under the Medicines Act 1968. They can, therefore, be marketed in the United Kingdom only if licensed under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Medicines Act requires that before any licences can be issued, the product must satisfy the scientific criteria of safety, quality and efficacy. I must make it clear that in this country that includes the treated animal, those who use the product, potential consumers of food from treated animals and the environment. Applicants are required to present all knowm data, whether favourable or unfavourable, for assessment by Government scientists and the Independent Veterinary Products Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An exhaustive study was carried out on BST applications over a number of years, as a result of which the Veterinary Products Committee concluded that the products presented no hazard to human health, were efficacious and of satisfactory quality. It was not satisfied, however, on the data available to it, with the animal welfare implications if the products were used commercially, and advised that a licence should not be issued on those grounds. This was taken up on appeal to the Medicines Commission, the senior appeal body
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
under the Act, who, after considering additional data presented to it, advised in January 1993 that the welfare concerns had been answered, and the criteria of safety, quality and efficacy had been met. A similar conclusion was reached by the Committee on Veterinary Medicinal products in Brussels in the spring of Last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable comment has however been made on the conditions of use included in the Committee's opinion. I can assure this Committee that these are perfectly normal elements of the licensing process, and do not represent anything out of the ordinary. Also in Brussels, the Commission's ethical advisers have pronounced themselves satisfied with BST, and the Commission itself has accepted that BST poses no hazard to consumers of milk from treated cows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding compliance with the scientific criteria, which are recognised around the world as the basis on which licensing decisions should and must be made, there has been considerable concern about the socio-economic need for products which enhance milk yield, at a time when milk quotas are in force. Although we have not formally consulted consumer organisations over the Commission's proposal for a prohibition because of the lack of time available, we have received a very considerable volume of correspondence from consumers expressing concern about the need for these products. We shall at a later stage be formally consulting the industry, consumers and all others responsible. It is an issue which I and my Ministerial colleagues have discussed with consumer representatives in quite some detail and will continue to do so in the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were prepared to support the original temporary moratorium on the licensing of BST products while the Commission prepared its report, including an assessment of the socio-economic aspects of the use of BST. But I have to say that we are not persuaded that this is an appropriate criterion to introduce into the licensing process. We remain firmly of the view that the approval of BST or any other medicinal product should be based solely on the existing objective criteria of safety, quality and efficacy. If these are satisfied, it should then be for the marketplace to decide on whether there is a need for such products, not for Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of BST, it is expected that it will be used selectively as a management aid given to individual animals at particular stages of lactation to improve the efficiency of milk production. It will be available only on veterinary prescription and is not intended for use in whole herds. The use of BST in these circumstances should not and will not lead to any significant increase in milk production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the direct effects on the companies involved in the production of BST, a further ban would create an unwelcome precedent for banning other biotechnology products on non-scientific grounds and pose a threat to the development and commercialisation of biotechnology in Europe—an extremely critical and crucial matter of importance to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The consequences of the GATT agreement also need to be carefully thought through. It is important that these factors are given due consideration and that the opportunity is taken to gain from experience of the use of BST in the United States. That is why we supported a further extension of the existing moratorium for not more than one year so that these could be taken into account in coming to a final view on the future of the moratorium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be considering the position carefully ourselves and listening to the various arguments that are put to us, including those of the Committee today, against the factors that I have outlined on which we believe such a decision should be based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will now take questions: I usually invite Committee Members to put one question at a time until all the questions have been exhausted. This part of the proceedings will finish at 11.30 am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Minister's opening remarks, he said that he felt that licensing BST would not increase milk production. That remark is hardly credible, because the purpose of BST is to increase milk production. Will the Minister explain the remark?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does he accept that there is an argument on socioeconomic grounds to look into any new technology that would affect the control of quotas within the European Union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a question to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food asking what estimates had been made of the increased cost of subsidies for milk production, were BST to become freely available in a non-quota system and if he would issue a statement. The hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in a written answer stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have made no such estimate as currently the Community has no policy to dismantle current milk quota arrangements".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 February 1994; Vol. 237, c. 108.]</p></blockquote>
That being so, does the Minister agree that it would be sensible to follow the Commission's recommendation of a ban of at least seven years to the year 2000, when milk quotas will be dismantled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the first point about quotas. Scientific advice is that BST will not increase overall milk production. I will give the hon. Gentleman the definitive answer to his question about increases in productivity. BST will be used as a management aid, when dealing with a milking herd, to the way in which lactations are handled. The Committee has seen the Commission's report that states that increases in milk yields from cows injected daily with BST are said to range from 6 per cent. to 30 per cent. Most studies have used a 20 per cent. increase and extrapolated it across the national herd. However, BST will not be used on all cows for various reasons of management and husbandry, nutrition, genetic merit and phsysological suitability. For other reasons, BST is unlikely to be used on heifers, namely, those in their first lactation, because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
they are still growing or are in the early stages of lactation. The 20 per cent. figure is likely to prove too high, since probably less than 50 per cent. of the total lactation might be affected. I understand the purpose of the hon. Gentleman's question. We are reasonably assured that BST will not be a significant factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister help me on the related matter of the biotechnology industry? The UK has a successful biotechnology industry, which welcomes the extension of the moratorium. What are the implications for that industry at this stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Plainly, the biotechnology industry is developing and fast moving, and the Government attach great importance to it. It is suggested that by the year 2000 the biotechnology industry in Europe will be worth £60 billion—a huge sum. British companies, including ICI, are at the forefront of these important developments across a range of activities, including genetic engineering and its use in plants and crops. It is our belief that a wrong signal on BST, taken for the wrong reasons—that is to say, for reasons outside the strict criteria laid down by the Medicines Act and agreed by everyone—would send the wrong message to companies seeking to invest in the UK and in the European Community, to the great detriment of the UK's industrial, research, engineering and science base and of employment and trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, it is important that the decision should be taken on the same basis as all other related decisions, on the strict criteria laid down by the Medicines Act 1968, namely, safety, efficacy and quality. I am grateful to the hon Lady for raising an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the composition of the Community Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products that examined the proposal? Is he satisfied with the scientific qualifications and the representation of the UK on that committee? Is he aware of any other product that has been refused licences or of any product that has had licences attached to it in the form of either husbandry or horticultural control? That is one question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, the hon. Lady, with her years of experience, manages to ask 30 questions in one question. Perhaps I may deal with the first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am sure that you would not allow me to bend the rules of order. Therefore, the Minister must be incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may help the Minister by responding to that point of order while he consults persons whom I do not see. That is not really a point of order. The hon. Lady stirred me out of peaceful bliss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear what the hon. Lady means. CVMP is composed of officials from all the national licensing bodies and meets in Brussels to coordinate the assessment of products that a company
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
wishes to sell widely in the Community. Experts from within and outside the Government also attend, if necessary, to advise. It may interest the hon. Lady to know that other products in the system are going through this procedure at the moment. None has been refused outright and others have conditions attached. If the hon. Lady tells me the names of the products in which she is interested, I shall obtain advice from officials and write to her in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European Commission proposed a general prohibition of BST during the operation of the milk quota system up to 31 March 2000. We know the reasons for the Government's opposition to that from the documents and from the Minister's statement. Who else in the Council of Ministers opposed the proposals that have been put forward by the European Commission and were the arguments in line with those of the British Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All member states were able to agree to the extended moratorium on BST until December 1994. On the question of a longer-term ban, Belgium, Spain, France and Italy support the UK view that any decision should be based on sound scientific principles. Germany and Luxembourg would prefer an outright ban.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), about the effects on productivity of the use of BST, I understood the Minister to say that it might affect productivity but not overall production. Can the Minister tell us of the likely effects on the dairy industry in the UK of the introduction and non-introduction of BST for an extended period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is all part of assessment carried out in the licensing agreement. The general view of the industry put forward to the committee is that the effect is likely to be broadly neutral. The drug is used as a management tool to increase the efficiency of the milk industry and I think it is more than likely to do so. The hon. Gentleman raises an important point relating to the assessment that we can make in Europe during this year's moratorium of how BST affects the herd in America. From that, we can extrapolate for our national herd. It is not possible to define the effect to the Nth degree. It is an increase in efficiency rather than in volume. We must wait to see BST works in America.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister considered the National Farmers Union recommendation that, were there any objection to the inclusion of BST-treated cows in a herd, this could be dealt with by using a trace element in the milk and the milk could be suitably labelled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of labelling is central to this debate and the hon. Lady who has a sharp eye for these things has come to one of the key points. I would like to explain to the Committee our current views on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, of course we acknowledge the consumer's desire to make an informed choice about what they eat
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
and drink. That is our starting position and I know that the hon. Lady agrees with it. There is nothing to prevent the voluntary labelling of milk from BST-treated cows should this be demanded by the marketplace, as has been the case, for example, with organic products. But it is a different matter to require the compulsory labelling of milk and all milk products, regardless of market pressure. Indeed, the Food Advisory Committee, the Government's independent advisory body, recently advised against extending labelling requirements in this way. We could impose a labelling requirement legitimately on health grounds only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remind the Committee that all the scientific advisory bodies and the European Commission itself have accepted that BST poses no hazard to human health. In any case a requirement to label would be unenforceable because manufactured BST is indistinguishable from naturally occurring BST which is found in minute quantities in all cows' milk. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Bless you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A labelling requirement would also have implications for trade, given that significant volumes of milk and milk products flow between the UK and other countries, particularly the US. I believe that the future of the moratorium, as I said earlier to my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. Edward O'Hara), should be firmly based on the scientific principles of safety, quality and efficacy, taking account of the American experience. As I said to the hon. Gentleman, he is quite right to emphasise those principles and the trade implications, and no other criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, Mr. Hogg, these requirements are met, the marketplace should determine the need and demand for products derived from BST-treated animals and, in particular, whether voluntary labelling has a part to play in informing consumer choice. Compulsory labelling cannot be justified scientifically and is unenforceable. It does not form an appropriate basis on which to extend the moratorium and I urge the Committee to proceed extremely carefully with that particular argument. I do not believe it stands up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister, therefore, of the opinion that this particular report is informed not so much by the intimation of safety under the Medicines Act, as for political reasons which are to do with the size of the beef herd and by the other political and economic implications that the changes in blocking or allowing BST would have within the agricultural sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must, with respect, disabuse the hon. Lady of that notion. As I said, if we get away from the criteria of the Medicines Act 1968, which has served this country extremely well, and the solely scientific grounds of safety, quality and efficacy, be it for political or any other reason, we really will be on dangerous, extremely unsuitable and ill-founded scientific ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This decision will be taken and has been taken, and the Commission must take it also, on the sole criteria by which these medicines have always been judged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I think that the Minister misunderstood me. I am sorry, Mr. Hogg, but it is important to clarify this. I am saying that in the Commission's paper, as opposed to the Minister's paper, other aspects of this problem are taken into account. Now I ask him again: is he of the opinion that the Commission's opinion is informed not by veterinary safety and the Medicines Act, but by the economic elements of the management of the herds which concern the Commission over and above the application of safety rules to the animals concerned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have to take advice before answering that question, in which case I will take another question now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall try to deal with the hon. Lady's point, but I am very grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, for your protection. I may not be able to answer the question as fully as she would like. She is referring to the fourth hurdle, the socio-economic element, that the Commission has included. In other words, it extends the principles of safety, quality and efficacy to include this other principle of socio-economic needs. In our opinion and in that of all respectable scientific thought across the Community, such criteria are necessarily entirely subjective and change, depending on economic circumstances. The licence system should be based, as we held, on objective, standard scientific principles. Wider socio-economic criteria are for the market to decide. It has always worked that way and that is the only way it can work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To return briefly to labelling, will the Minister tell us how consumers in the marketplace can make an informed choice about what they buy, if such a product is not labelled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, I tried to make it plain in a carefully prepared and rather long-winded answer exactly what are our views on the consumer element. We have consulted with consumers extensively. I have consulted the consumer panel and the Minister has met the head representatives of all the consumer bodies. We shall be undertaking a complete consultation in the moratorium year with all consumer bodies, the industry, the milk people, the NFU and everyone else. I believe my answer was correct: we have to stick to the advice that we are given by our professional advisers, the Food Advisory Committee, and we cannot extend compulsory labelling except for a particularly exceptional reason. This is not the right case for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that does not answer my question. I asked how consumers were expected to make an informed choice in the absence of labelling. Will the Minister give me his opinion on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the situation I have outlined, the characteristics of synthetically produced BST are identical to those of the naturally produced substance. A labelling requirement is frankly unenforceable. That is why I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question any further than I have already done in great detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the answer is that the consumer does not have the right to decide between the alternatives. The Minister earlier argued that the marketplace should decide whether people wished to have BST-induced products or not. Any theory of market competition that I know of, such as that of perfect competition, assumes that perfect knowledge is available. If that is to be available, however irrelevant that may seem to the Minister, should labelling not be pursued?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot agree with that view. I have given an extremely detailed answer on labelling. During consultations we shall listen carefully to what all the consumer organisations and others have to say. I am sure you will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to read out that long-winded answer again, Mr. Hogg, but for the reasons I have given labelling would be impractical and unenforceable. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Good morning. Perhaps I may read it out again for the benefit of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) who has just arrived in his place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I direct the Minister's mind to the document entitled "Select Committee on European Legislation, Extract from Second Report of Session 1993–94" and ask him if he would accept that under 7.9 the criteria of safety, quality and efficacy have been met, but that the additional safeguards that are suggested there and which are fairly straightforward and sensible would not only be acceptable but would not be difficult to impose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I am not sure what the hon. Lady's question is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me start again. The Select Committee on European Legislation looked carefully at this matter and said that it accepted the recommendations of the CVMP on safety, quality and efficacy. It went on to say, however, that, in order to be doubly sure, certain other aspects should be addressed, including a high nutritional regime, good hygiene at the injection site, on-going monitoring—which seems to me important—specific instructions for use and a structured programme of pharmaco-vigilance. If it is accepted that BST is to be used, does the Minister believe that those are useful recommendations and that they are possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do. I have the paper in front of me and I can confirm that we accept all the recommendations. They are the normal recommendations put forward in licensing any of these products. There is nothing unusual about them and they have all been accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To move a little further down the document, at paragraph 7.11 of the Select Committee on European Legislation's extract there are references to the Minister of State's remarks. I am particularly interested in the last part of the first paragraph, where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is also a need to avoid potential international trading problems … vis-à-vis BST".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Can the Minister help me by outlining some of the problems that we may face?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to stick to the existing regime, which has served us extremely well, it is important that we do not act abnormally or in a way in which we would not act for any other drug or medicine that has gone through this system. For instance, under GATT imports of products can be prohibited only if there is strong scientific evidence to prove that they would cause an unacceptable hazard to human, animal or plant health and safety. The appropriate authorities all agree that that is not the case with BST, and a failure to abide by these agreements could result in a formal challenge that would require a change in the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the situation as it is, as opposed to as it might be. The current ban on the use of BST does not extend to imports of dairy products from those countries where it is known that BST is already used. The European Parliament recently recommended that the ban should be so extended. Ministers have consistently stressed the need to avoid international trading problems, and the Community will clearly wish to abide by the terms of GATT and the recent agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures which was included in the Uruguay round settlement. Therefore, this is yet another reason why we would find ourselves outside the ordinary, agreed procedures, which have served world trade, and this country, particularly in the Medicines Act, extremely well. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that key point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to you, Mr. Hogg, and to the Minister for coming in late and missing his opening statement. As you know, some of us on the Committee considering the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Bill are under pressure from people outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question to the Minister is a more fundamental one. At present, as I have seen in the farming industry and as it has been reported to me as common throughout Britain, there is a fall in the number of milk-producing farms because of quota problems and because we are losing quotas. What possible justification is there for introducing an artificial hormone to stimulate an increase in milk production when people who make their livelihood from milk production by natural means have been losing money because of milk quotas and cuts brought about by the common agricultural policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see the hon. Gentleman. He always plays a constructive role in our discussions. We cantered round that course just before he arrived. It is plainly an important matter. BST is seen by the milk industry as a tool for the management of the herds rather than as an attempt to boost production. As I said before the hon. Gentleman arrived, it is likely to increase efficiency rather than production capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the year-long moratorium agreed by the Community, which on balance I think is sensible, is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
that we shall be able to monitor the way in which the drug operates and works in the United states of America where, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the drug was licensed and commenced use on 1 February this year. We shall then see what conclusions we can draw. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which is a fair point. This drug has now passed all the stages laid down under the Medicines Act. It has overcome enormous hurdles and satisfied rigorous and testing criteria, so it is now cleared for licensing in the United States of America. We shall have to wait and see how it works out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall ask three related questions on the labelling regime. If a pirate batch of milk came on the market with traces of synthetic BST in it, would it be possible to distinguish a bottle of that milk from a bottle of milk which had traces of natural BST in it? Secondly, are there any known physiological effects on a human being from drinking either bottle of milk? Finally, if a system of labelling were introduced, how would that affect the economics of BST?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, it is impossible to detect whether the milk contains natural BST or manufactured BST.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a straight answer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a straight answer. It is possible to detect BST in milk, and it would show in traces at about one part per billion, so we are talking about minute quantities. But is is impossible to detect whether it is manufactured or natural BST.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the physiological effects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To repeat the other two parts of my question, if a person drank either bottle, is there any known difference in physiological effects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there is absolutely no difference in the physiological or biological effects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My third question was: how would a system of labelling affect the economics—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I occasionally handle these affairs very informally, but the hon. Gentleman is not entitled to sit in his place and have a chat with the Minister about a bottle of milk. The hon. Gentleman must stand and address the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hogg. I was trying to be helpful to the Minister by reminding him of the third question, which he had forgotten.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I greatly enjoy these chats across the Floor with my friends on the Opposition Benches. I am sorry, I did not really connect with what the hon. Gentleman was saying. There would not be any economic effect from labelling, because milk is already labelled. If people wanted to label their milk as con-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
taining manufactured BST, there would be nothing to stop them doing so. There is no effect on the consumer. BST would not have passed these rigorous hurdles, had there been. It has passed all the tests of safety, quality and efficacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Ministry undertaken an estimate of how many drugs are used in the management of a healthy herd during a normal agricultural year, how many of those are registered under the Medicines Act and what the effect would be on consumers if they were given a long list of all the drugs that are used in the management of a herd?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will have to procure for the hon. Lady a detailed answer on that question by letter because, plainly, many drugs will be registered while others, like the disinfectants, will probably not be registered. I would be happy to provide the hon. Lady with a list and we shall ensure that is done and properly sent to other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Select Committee on European Legislation, in its report on 8 December, in paragraphs 7.14 and 7.15 criticises MAFF, and the procedures and delay in supplying information. Also paragraph 7.13 refers to a number of questions. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The following points are among those which fall to be considered;"</p></blockquote>
I do not expect the Minister to answer the five questions now, although I might have five opportunities to ask them. Is there a written response to those questions available to members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman spent a little more time listening to what I said and a little less time bouncing up on points of order, he would have heard me deal with those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I withdraw what I said. If the hon. Gentleman had listened carefully to what I said, Mr. Hogg, he would have heard me deal with all those points fully. If he were to read the record of the Committee, he would see my responses there; the excellent 	<i>Hansard</i> staff would have ensured that they are in the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O' Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been little reference so far to the physiological effects on the cow of administering BST. Could the Minister give us some information about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman is asking what BST does. When injected into a cow, it stimulates milk production, possibly by 10 to 15 per cent., for proposed commercial doses. It is only one of several factors, such as genetic suitability, nutrition and husbandry, that have this effect. The increased yield attributable to BST also varies, depending on genetic and management factors. Cows which yield better before treatment, sometimes respond less when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
treated. As I said, this is designed to be a management aid in the production of milk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the same point, the CVMP said that BST injected into cows led to an increase in the incidence of mastitis in treated animals. Could we have some information as to the nature of those incidents, their seriousness and the problems that will generally be created within Council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am happy to provide that information. This is a factor which some of the animal welfare groups have flagged up and I think that it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, generally speaking, as to whether BST will increase welfare problems, it is the assessment of everyone involved in this—the licensing authorities and everyone else—that if used properly, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, BST should not cause general health or welfare problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether it is true that BST causes increased incidence of mastitis, some studies have suggested this, while others have found no increase. Results are difficult to analyse, but increased incidence of mastitis is directly linked to milk yield, to the trial site and the stage of lactation. There is no evidence of a significant direct treatment-related increase in mastitis. Indeed, there is some suggestion that BST treatment results in reduced severity and duration of mastitis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same Committee went on to point out that normal hygiene practices may not be adequate to prevent injection site reactions, and it insisted that after injection, they must be cleaned with 70 per cent. alcohol. Is it likely that on a busy farm people will be able to pursue those procedures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, clearly, of course it is. The initial recommendations of subcutaneous injection in the shoulder gave unacceptable injection site reactions. Injection at the tail head causes little discomfort and if a reaction does occur at the site, it is generally mild and reversible and causes no undue suffering. Cleaning with alcohol should overcome any hygiene worries at that site. Post-marketing monitoring, as recommended by the CVMP, will include monitoring of adverse reactions and hygiene measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say to the hon. Gentleman that, generally speaking, although he has raised an important point about hygiene, the production of milk in this country involves the use of very hygienic practices. Although all farmers are busy, giving an animal an injection of this type involves a great deal of care and there are always bad apples in every barrel. However, by and large, we are quite satisfied that this would not be a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pursue that point, at the briefing by the Compassion in World Farming, which is an organisation that we all respect, it was pointed out that 33 per cent. of cows in the European Community suffer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
from mastitis. That seems to be a very high proportion. That is partly because the yield of the modern cow, because of the way in which cows are looked after, is 10 times higher than is necessary for that cow to suckle a calf, if it had a calf at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same report points out that a Danish study shows an increase of between 15 and 45 per cent. in mastitis where BST is used. An American study points out a similar increase in mastitis and concludes that the use of antibiotics to treat the increased mastitis results in residues of those antibiotics in the milk that is then offered for consumption. That should concern us and therefore we support the amendments in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Harry Barnes).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I have already answered that question, but I will do so again. Some studies have suggested that, while others have found no increase in mastitis. Results are difficult to analyse, but increased incidence of mastitis is directly linked to milk yield, trial site and stage of lactation. There is no evidence of a significant direct treatment-related increase in mastitis. There is some suggestion that BST treatment results in reduced severity and duration of mastitis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of BST on high-yielding cows, is not recommended on animals of that type because there would be no benefit in that. I believe that the mastitis question is important. We shall continue to monitor the situation in the United States of America, where BST has been in use since 1 February, and plainly that experience will inform some of our decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the hon. Gentleman asked about MRLs, which are the maximum permitted residue limits in food from treated animals. It is an offence to sell for slaughter, or to slaughter, any animal containing residues in excess of the MRL specified for some 30 substances. The CVMP has recommended that no MRL needs to be established for the two BST products it has examined, and antibiotics are included in that list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does any other product come to the Minister's mind, on which a moratorium has been imposed, which has met all the safety recommendations of existing medicines law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I have been advised by my officials that there is no other product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If close attention is being paid to developments in America and BST is used there, what commercial impact does this begin to have upon the European Union? Particularly, do problems arise from the operation of GATT if the moratorium is continued within the European Union and extension has taken place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have dealt with the question of the situation under GATT. There is no import ban proposed by the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have concluded Question Time, I shall invite the Minister to move his motion. He may move it formally if he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 8757/93 and 10761/93, relating to bovine somatotrophin (BST), and of the recommendation to prohibit the marketing and use of BST for the duration of milk quotas; and supports the subsequent Council Decision for a continuation of the existing moratorium until 31st December 1994, linked to a declaration that the Council uses this period to consider the implications of a long-term prohibition and, in particular, experience of its use in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that I have listened with the greatest interest to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. It is customary for the Minister to conclude the sitting by responding to contributions made by hon. Members to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No point of order arises, because I advised the Minister that he could move the motion formally if so he wished. The Minister chose instead to make a statement, and it is wholly in order for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I was trying to be helpful to the Minister. It seemed that he was leading in to making observations that might be more appropriate at the end of the Committee when more observations have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that what the Minister says is not a point of order for me. He may say anything so long as it is in order. It is in order to thank hon. Members. It might be rash, but it is in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. Can you confirm that the debate will continue for a specific period after the Minister sits down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even for those who were late.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that you have said that, Mr. Hogg, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear the Minister say that. He would certainly be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not about to make a further statement, but to move the motion formally. If it inconveniences the hon. Gentleman, I shall not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the discussion so far, it is clear that there is anxiety and concern on three main fronts. The first concern is the use of BST at a time when milk quotas
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
are in force, which is a fair and important point that will need to be dealt with thoroughly. The second concern relates to licensing under the Medicines Act 1968 and whether the criteria of safety, quality and efficacy, which have stood the test of time well, should be extended to include the fourth hurdle, that of socioeconomic necessity, which I detect to be behind some of the questions asked by hon. Gentlemen. The third, important concern is how the use of BST will affect animal welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to listen now to hon. Members debate the motion. I assure them that I shall consider carefully what they say and will bear in mind what comes out of the Committee when we make a decision in some months' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two amendments. It may be helpful if I explain the procedure. I have selected the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire, and, for the purposes of the debate, they will be taken together. At some stage during the debate, if the hon. Gentleman wishes, he may catch my eye and I shall call him to move amendment (a). Debate may then continue on the amendment and motion together. At the end of the debate, I will put the Question on the amendment. If it is carried, I will allow amendment (b) to be moved formally and voted on. If amendment (a) is not carried, amendment (b) will fall and I shall not therefore allow it to be moved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the amendments are disposed of, I shall put the Question on the main motion, as amended or not. I hope that that is quite clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.24 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister clearly identified, from the detail of the questions and the concern that has been expressed by the Committee, that there is anxiety about the use of an artificial hormone like BST.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response, their motion and the Council of Ministers' response, are somewhat inadequate with regard to dealing with the issue and I much prefer the way it is dealt with in the response of the Commission and in the amendments in the name of my hon. Friend, the Member for Derbyshire, North-East.

It is not adequate to say that we shall wait a year to see what happens in America and that, as long as people do not develop horns and run around mooing, it will be something we can then implement in our own country and within the European Union. The sort of problems associated with BST go much further than that and the socio-economic aspect is just one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister rightly said, BST can increase milk yield by an average of 15 per cent. I cannot accept the Minister's statement that this is simply an efficiency measure and that it will not have any impact on milk yield, or, alternatively on herd size. It has to be one or the other because, if an artificial hormone to increase yield is introduced onto the market, market forces

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
themselves will put pressure on individual milk producers either to go down that road and use BST or to go out of business. It opens a Pandora's box within the milk-producing sector and raises questions of controls and quotas which have not been adequately dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four main points: first, there is the question of whether it is safe for consumers to use and the Minister has already outlined the procedures that BST has been put through, which I accept. Secondly, does it meet welfare standards? There are serious question marks over that and I will expand on the evidence for that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what the Minister said, there is authoritative evidence that BST can increase the incidence of mastitis. I accept that BST does not cause mastitis, but it can certainly increase it by the very fact that it increases milk yield and the amount of milk going through the udder, which in itself, is the cause of mastitis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the important question of whether BST is desirable and whether we need such a product when we have a surplus capacity for milk. Fourthly, we must ask whether it provides consumer choice. That aspect has been raised during the course of the debate and my hon. Friend's amendment deals with it. At present, it is almost impossible to use BST and not to have it enter the general milk pool. It is difficult to separate—though technically not impossible—and it is difficult to identify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes an important point.

Report A3–426/93 of the European Parliament, for which Mr. Vasco Garcia was the rapporteur, accepted the argument that BST products should not be allowed into the European Union.

Documents that are relevant to the Committtee today are before the Committee, but it is in order for the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I appreciate what my hon.

While I do not intend to go into great detail on the report, it is relevant to what we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ban was proposed. Although the Commission did not accept the recommendation from the group in the European Parliament that the ban should be indefinite, it recommended that the ban should continue until the year 2000. It is the Council of Ministers response to that recommendation and its decision of the one-year ban that we are discussing. It is important to get that in perspective. It is also relevant to remember that the European Parliament has had time to consider this matter in depth. My hon. Friend has a vast experience of the European Parliament and I know her views on it well, but I believe its views deserve consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Veterinary Products Committee reports on BST, I accept what the Minister says, that BST has satisfied the criteria of safety, quality and efficacy under the procedures that are laid down. However, the VPC expressed concern about the welfare aspect. The Minister rightly touched on that and said that in the appeal procedure the concern about the welfare aspect was dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the principle of biotechnology and recognise that it is an enormous potential market for our country. We understand that, if it is applied properly and goes through the proper procedures, it has enormous benefits, not only for exports but for agricultural production. I am aware that some hon. Members, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South, have factories in their constituencies which are involved in this production. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang) recently visited the Dista factory in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South at the invitation of the Joint Union Council. He had the opportunity of speaking to its trade unions, management and work force as well as local Members of Parliament about the substantial investment that Eli Lilly has made in parts of our country. That is not to say that even when there is a substantial investment and the operation is carried out with care and quality, which I do not doubt for a moment in the case of either Eli Lilly or Monsanto, we must not still think carefully about the impact of these products on the wider community and about their application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The product which has been put through the accepted and recognised procedures of the VPC has satisfied all those criteria. I accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is BST considered to be safe for cows as well as for people consuming dairy products?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall now concentrate on that point, because even having passed the safety criteria, as I accept BST has, the welfare implications for the animals must still be considered. I am not satisfied that they have been and I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Milk production is very efficient in this country, and dairy cows, through selective breeding, are already producing at or above their limit. When a cow consistently produces more milk that it is naturally capable of doing, welfare problems are bound to follow, and that has been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two main problems relating to welfare implications. The first is lameness that results when cattle receive a rich and unnatural diet necessary for high metabolism. If BST is used, cows must have increased feed in order to maintain their high productivity. Because the cows carry huge unnatural udders, their legs are forced apart. They are not designed to carry this amount of weight. In this country 25 per cent. of dairy cows already have problems of lameness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second condition mentioned is mastitis. This is an extremely painful condition for the animal concerned and comes about through the unnatural overworking of the udder, which is essential for high levels of milk production. We have heard that one third of all dairy cows in this country already suffer from mastitis. So again it follows that, if this artificial hormone is allowed to be used, there will be increased problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give an idea of the scale of the problem, an efficient milk cow produces something like 30 litres of milk a day, which is 10 times that needed for a calf. In normal circumstances, a dairy cow would last for about 20 lactations. Many cows are now culled after four lactations or less through sheer exhaustion. Each cow now produces an average of twice as much milk as was the case just after the war. So with that level of increased efficiency, where is the argument for an artificial hormone such as BST?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was no evidence of welfare risk, but I have a significant quotation from a Mr. Willenberg of the department of animal science and animal health at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Copenhagen, Denmark, who carried out a detailed study of the effect of BST and the welfare risk. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"BST treatment is associated with 15–45% excess incidence of clinical mastitis, which is probably due to an indirect causal effect through increased milk yield."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
The Minister will accept that that is an impartial and respectable opinion that demonstrates that there is a severe welfare risk from the use of BST.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the use of BST would be under veterinary prescription. That will add difficulties, particularly for small dairy farmers. I shall return to the socio-economic impact of this. If BST is put on the market and farmers are to use it under veterinary supervision, they will inevitably be forced to use it whether or not they like it. There will be increased cost resulting from veterinary prescriptions and in terms of the artificial feed that goes with BST. This will force many small milk producers out of production. The Minister may say that that is market forces, but we should have some consideration for rural employment and for the parts of our country where employment prospects are low. The wider implications of the effect of using BST must be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important point is.consumer reaction. The Minister will find that nearly all consumer groups in this country are very much opposed to BST being used or, at least, to its use being implemented without adequate labelling. The studies by the EC Commission have shown that there is a suggestion that, if BST was allowed in milk products without compulsory labelling, it could lead to as much as an 11 per cent. reduction in the consumption of milk products, with the associated knock-on effects that that would have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the issue of small farms. We want to ensure that people are kept on the land in certain parts of the country. We do not want to see rural depopulation. We in the Labour party have policies through our green premium support scheme to support small farmers and the environment. We do not believe that the introduction of BST will do anything to help a policy of trying to support the environment or small farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the ban on milk products coming into the European Union from other parts of the world. This is very important in connection with the points which I have already emphasised. There is a serious welfare problem here. If we do not have a ban on such products coming into this country or, at least, adequate labelling on such milk products, large dairy units, for example in Eastern Europe, will use this hormone, and the welfare standards in some of those large dairy units in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world are much lower than the welfare standards in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
If those products are to come into the European Union, our policy is that they should be clearly labelled as containing BST, so that consumers can make their own choice as to whether or not they buy those products. If they are not labelled in that way, they should not be allowed into the European Union. That is our policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find this interesting. Is it being suggested that there should also be a detailed explanation of the scientific aspects of BST attached to every yoghurt and every imported milk product?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is feasible. My hon. Friend is probably aware that there are precedents for that kind of argument, for example irradiated food products carry a code so that consumers are aware that the food has been irradiated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even in his wildest fantasies, the hon. Gentleman cannot link irradiated food to BST. Let me make the point which is I think behind what the hon. Lady, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs Dunwoody) is saying and which is a very important point that the hon. Gentleman has made. If he is proposing a ban on imports containing BST, he is flying directly in the face of the GATT agreement and the sanitary and phytosanitary agreements. Is he telling us that it is the policy of his party to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am saying that the European Community has already recommended a ban on imports of products containing BST. It is Labour party policy to support that recommendation, unless there is adequate labelling so that consumers can make their choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister may be mistaken about GATT. There are procedures in GATT, regarding the implications of these additives, which can be considered. It is quite a long-winded and complicated procedure, but it certainly exists. I would have hoped that the Government would have argued and fought for that, because certainly a Labour Government would argue and fight for the rights of consumers to make an informed consumer choice on milk products containing BST.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend comment on the fact that any artificial barrier to or constraint on trade which is applied to the importation of products within GATT would materially damage the interests of British industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that in this case it would. In fact, I think that the availability of BST would damage the interests of our dairy industry. If I did not, I would not be arguing in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must disagree with the Minister's comment that the issue of marking food products which have been irradiated is not relevant. I am talking about the principle involved, not the actual procedures. The principle has been established. Because of consumer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
concern, food which has been irradiated is marked. I also understand that, again because of consumer concern, food which contains genetically modified organisms will also be marked so that consumers are aware of this. So there is a precedent for this principle in those two areas. What is wrong, then, with conceding the principle of marking dairy products which have had BST added?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is of course the problem at present that BST cannot be identified. It is possible to put a tracer within artificial BST so that it can be identified. I would argue that until such a tracer is made available, BST should not be allowed to be marketed if it cannot be identified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always reluctant to become involved in others' personal grief. Clearly people have problems with constitutional arrangements in Europe rather than with this issue. I am also worried about the Minister's intervention. He seemed to be saying that there was no need to let people know that BST was being used in the production of dairy products. Is it not possible that that is because the Select Committee on European Legislation noted in paragraph 7.8 that there might be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a significant fall in consumption of milk and dairy products",</p></blockquote>
if BST was used? That shows that people are becoming increasingly resistant to artificially stimulated production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point. The figure for potential fallout is put at 11 percent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was expanding on the point about allowing products containing BST into the European Union. If that became established, it is likely that the large dairy units in eastern Europe, where welfare standards are low, would produce more and more milk. That would undermine producers in the UK. Small producers in the Minister's constituency would find it hard to compete with that milk production. It is likely that they would be forced out of business. Many dairy farmers would give up dairy farming and might well switch to beef or other forms of production. In the west country, where there is a great deal of milk production and animal husbandry, that would have an impact on conservation, because we want to have wet grassland. To allow an open market for BST products would undermine conservation. If there is to be a ban or a moratorium within the European Union, it is nonsense to allow imports of milk products containing BST. It makes sense to ban them so long as there is a decision to ban them within the European Union and the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems ridiculous to allow use of a product that increases milk production while there is in place a system of quotas to control milk production. It took a great deal of time and trouble to apply them. It is stated in Agra-Briefing No. 19 of February 1989 that the introduction of BST will
	<br><blockquote><p>"accelerate the trend to fewer dairy farms and larger units which has developed over the last two decades."</p></blockquote>
Some people may think that that is desirable, but I do not think that it is for overall employment and production patterns in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
The European Commission communication to the Council and European Parliament concerning BST states that BST would
	<br><blockquote><p>"lead to greater rationalisation at farm level, with a tendency for smaller producers to go out of business."</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt about that. It went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a quota system it is difficult for small producers to expand their output, and with the economies of scale available to large scale producers, BST would strengthen their position further. This would tend to concentrate dairy production in larger and more intensive holdings. This could have implications for the viability of milk processing facilities served largely by smaller producers."</p></blockquote>
The communication goes further than milk producers to dairy facilities in isolated parts of the UK, especially the west and south-west. Such structures are usually found in the less favoured areas with few alternatives to milk production. These are important considerations that go beyond science. A responsible Government should consider the wider implications of products of this type.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the question of CAP reform and expenditure. The Minister knows of the pressure, not least from Opposition Members, to bring the CAP under control. I do not see how BST will help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the matter of the instability of the milk and beef markets. It is likely that in the long term the milk market will stabilise after the introduction of BST, but in the short and medium terms there will be major instability in the structure of the UK dairy industry. Indeed, as I mentioned, that is likely to spill over into the beef sector, as people move into beef and away from dairy production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise our main concerns, we recognise that BST has serious animal welfare implications. The evidence is there. It is independent and authoritative, and should be taken seriously. The Labour party wants to improve animal welfare whenever possible, but think that BST would have the opposite effect. We believe that we should keep people on the land whenever possible, particularly in isolated rural communities, but that BST would work against that. We believe that support should be given to the small farmer, but that extensive production of BST would work mainly in favour of large, intensive farms and is likely to lead to large-scale rationalisation. We believe that we ought to support farms in the more deprived and less favoured areas, but that BST would work against this, either by destroying a sector of agriculture or, indeed, by pushing other sectors into more intensive production. We want to ensure that agricultural support is switched within the CAP towards environmental considerations, but we believe that BST would work against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose financial waste. It is not sensible or rational to introduce a product which reduces the size of herds and the number of those farming and which may increase the amount of subsidies from the European Union, by increasing the levels of a commodity that we already over-produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the consumer has a right to know, not only what is in food but how it is produced. If BST
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
is benign, people would have no argument about compulsory labelling. It is nonsense to suggest that the people who produce BST would volunteer to join a voluntary scheme of BST labelling. If they think that, I would be most interested if they would make public that view because that would erase the whole issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this matter of labelling, the hon. Gentleman said earlier that he did not believe that synthetic BST should be used without a tracer to detect its presence and that all products from a cow taking added BST should be labelled. Can I ask how far he is going to take this? If a veterinary surgeon is called to treat an animal and in the course of treatment that animal is given drugs, how does the hon. Gentleman intend to insist that any products from that individual animal should bear a label indicating that it has received a certain drug during its life?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must be reasonable. The position I am taking, incidentally, is a position supported by the National Farmers Union. It takes exactly the same position as we do in the Labour party. It is interesting that we and the National Farmers Union seem to be ranged against the Conservative party at the present time on issues like this. There are regulations about treating animals with drugs. If those drugs, which are administered for health reasons, go over certain levels, it does mean that meat cannot be marketed. There are procedures laid down at the present time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Ms Gillan) has made my point. I have already acknowledged that labelling is an important issue, as the hon. Gentleman knows and everyone accepts that. The hon. Gentleman is being unrealistic. He may or may not understand this about the countryside, but all milk is bulked up. He is, therefore, suggesting that farmer A, who may have used BST on one or two of his cows,—has BST-produced milk, and that the individual cow should be identified and its milk kept separately from the milk of the other cows in the herd. Is that what the hon. Gentleman is seriously suggesting? If he is, it simply is not possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right that that is not feasible in that sense, in which case BST should not be introduced. I am well aware that milk is bulked up and if the Minister had been listening, he would have heard me mention that at the beginning of my speech and that it is almost impossible to separate BST products from mainstream products. If BST products cannot be separated, its presence should be marked on a label. If BST-produced milk is going into the total milk pool, all the milk products which have had contact with that artificial hormone should be labelled, too. If that cannot be done, BST should not be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I and the Labour party are interested in is consumer choice. Consumers have every right to make up their minds whether they buy products which contain artificially produced hormones. If BST goes into the total milk pool, there should be labelling to identify that. I recognise that it is difficult to do that, but if the labelling cannot be dealt with satisfactorily, BST should not be allowed to be marketed in the European Union. That is an issue which the producers need to address, because we are talking about consumer choice and consumer confidence. This matter needs to be taken very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern about consumer labelling is not unique to the Labour party, but is shared, as far as I am aware, by virtually every consumer group in this country, by groups such as the Women's Institute—a group with which the Minister would do well not to tangle—the National Farmers Union, other producer organisations and all the welfare organisations. That seems to me a pretty formidable list of people who share our concern for proper consumer labelling of products of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman plainly does not understand the situation. BST is found in all milk at all times at a level of less than one part per billion. What the hon. Gentleman is suggesting is not feasible. Consumer choice is plainly vital, but common sense must be applied to this matter. The manufactured or natural level of BST is untraceable. It is not enforceable. What the hon. Gentleman is proposing is totally impracticable. If a tracer were discovered, its use would still have to be carefully considered, but there is as yet no sign of a tracer to detect BST in milk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the situation all too clearly. It is theoretically possible to develop a tracer. It is true that there is none at present, but I believe that, unless a tracer is introduced so that BST can be identified, BST should not be allowed. If a tracer is found, BST should be identified by label. My understanding is the same as that of the NFU. For the Minister's information, I shall read its recommendation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The NFU is … committed by the food policy agreed by Council to the principle of consumer choice, and because the presence of artificial BST cannot be easily detected in milk produced from treated cows, there is no firm basis for consumers to choose whether or not to buy this milk."</p></blockquote>
We would not disagree with that for one moment. The NFU goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The current EC moratorium on commercial licensing should continue."</p></blockquote>
We would not disagree with that.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The licensing of veterinary products should only be according to the objective criteria of safety, quality and efficacy."</p></blockquote>
I have made it clear that we do not disagree with that.
	<br><blockquote><p>"All BST products licensed for use should contain a tracer so it is detectable in milk. Until such BST products are available no licences for use should be granted."</p></blockquote>
We would not disagree with that position either.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Milk and milk products made from milk which has been produced with the use of BST should be labelled so that consumers may make an informed choice"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
It seems to me that we in the Labour party are more attuned than the Minister to the interests of producers in this country. We understand all too clearly the implications of BST, both for welfare and for consumer choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A large body of people in the country who are vegetarians are also concerned about animal welfare. Because of that concern, they want to be able to study the details of the products that they are purchasing. It is likely that that group of people also wishes not to have artificially induced BST because of their views about animal welfare. Whether those views are right or wrong, substantial arguments can be made on either side. They should have an opportunity to make the choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point which I wholeheartedly endorse. However, I want to come to a conclusion, because my remarks have been longer than I expected, although I am happy to put the Minister right on a few issues and correct him on one or two others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is simple: do we believe in consumer choice? If the Government do not, we in the Labour party most certainly do. We want to make sure that consumers have a choice in respect of food such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware from letters that he has no doubt received—I have received letters in great numbers—of consumers' concern about additives to a product regarded as wholesome and nourishing. People do not want to see it adulterated even if it still passes quality standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remain issues of consumer confidence and consumer choice, which the Council of Ministers' recommendation does not adequately answer. That is why we in the Labour party are saying that BST should not be introduced in the European Union until it can be identified or properly labelled. For that reason I wholeheartedly endorse the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Animal welfare has also not been satisfactorily dealt with. There are still genuine question marks over the impact of an artificial hormone on cattle which have been bred to over-produce and the associated problems of lameness and mastitis. We believe that BST can add to that problem and that the issue has not been satisfactorily researched, explained or taken into account. Until it is, the moratorium on BST should be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the impact on rural employment and rationalisation in the dairy industry, which we think is neither desirable nor needed when there is over-capacity of milk production in this country. We believe there is no need for an artificial hormone of this type.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything that I have argued from the Labour point of view is endorsed by consumer groups, by the

National Farmers Union and by organisations and welfare groups throughout the country, as the Minister knows well. I have been surprised to note during the discussion that the government's position has been more extreme than the motion suggests. We must give serious consideration to all the issues that we have outlined. If this Government will not do that, a future Labour Government most certainly will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully endorse my hon. Friend's last remark. Indeed a Labour Government would have to consider seriously the real implications of the motion, which have not been fully debated. The fundamental question is where the United Kingdom's interest lies in allowing a ban on a scientific product which has been cleared by a veterinary committee, which is known to have a direct effect on the management of herds and which has not been demonstrated to be deleterious either to the management of existing herds or to human health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we occasionally get carried away by some of the slightly doubtful briefings submitted to hon. Members. It saddens me a little when I hear people quoted in this Committee who are part of an existing organisation in the Community, paid for by Community funds and with no particular interest in providing independent or accurate briefing. They may think that they are briefing accurately, but I learnt very quickly in the European Community that some of their sources were, at best, suspect and, at worst, positive disinformation. However, it is unkind of me to mention that.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come from a large milk-producing area on the Cheshire plain where animal husbandry is absolutely vital. Many of the arguments that we have heard this morning are at best doubtful. I have seen great changes in animal husbandry, particularly in the management of milk herds, and I know that it is the improvements in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
hygiene that have made the real difference to animal health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mastitis is concerned with dirt and there is no real evidence that the percentages of animals affected are massively disadvantaged. I believe that there are real reasons to monitor the effect of the use of drugs on an animal herd. However, I am not convinced by some of the evidence presented to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in doubt about that, Mr. Hogg. However, my hon. Friend mentioned that mastitis was primarily caused by dirt. Would she not accept that it is primarily caused by the amount of milk that goes through the udder and that if follows that, if the yield from individual cattle is increased by 15 per cent. on average, that is bound to cause an increase in the incidence of clinical mastitis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that mastitis is one element concerned. Believe me, females know more about mastitis than do males. Cleanliness makes a difference to the management of herds. Many present-day techniques have contributed to a change in the quality of milk and of milk products. However, that does not concern me this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me strongly are the political arguments. We have been asked to look at the political arguments, but they have not been fully addressed. I believe that any organisation that imposes a ban on a product that has been declared by its committee of safety to be perfectly safe is doing something which this Parliament should examine carefully before allowing it to go forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ban is being imposed although, on both veterinary and safety of medicines grounds, the product is acceptable. Therefore, one must assume that the reasons for "the ban concern not animal husbandry or safety of the individual, but a great many other arguments that are plainly deduced in the Commission's documents. They relate to the amount of liquid milk and, in my view, relate clearly to the Commission's desire to allow many small units to continue in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of "small" in relation to milk herds within the Community is very different from that of "small" in this country because the Commission is not prepared to tackle at any level the fact that many people within the Community still maintain four or five cows, calling that an adequate number to produce liquid milk. That is what concerns the Community and that is why it seeks a ban of this product. The case has not been made made for the maintenance of a ban

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
beyond a year in which the physical and political effects are carefully monitored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the place for me to argue the rights and wrongs of putting artificial constraints on trade, but it is not in the interests of a trading nation such as ours to seek to impose bans on the importation of products from outside the Community on the basis that there would be some clear and deleterious effect upon consumers. That is not so and the United Kingdom would suffer if we sought to impose artificial constraints on trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend trying to suggest that increased milk production of 11 per cent. would not impact on the dairy farmers she knows? I would ask her to come to central Scotland, the area that I represent, and meet dairy farmers who are vulnerable to any increase, let alone an 11 per cent. increase in milk production that may come about as a result of the use of BST.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not actually arguing that. I am saying that, during the year in which we are to monitor the effect of the ban, there is ample time to work out whether the figures that have been presented to us by the Community are accurate. What concerns me is the political argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the Commission be allowed to get away with imposing a ban, not because there are clear scientific reasons, but because it is seeking to use a scientific ban to being about other, political ends? If the British Government and the Parliament of the United Kingdom accept that the Community has the right to distort trade and to bring about other changes on the basis, not of political or economic arguments, but because it wishes to use scientific methods to argue its case, I will stand aside and accept that I am wrong. However, I do not believe that the case for that has been made and the arguments from the (Opposition have been almost entirely about animal husbandry and consumer affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am second to none in my commitment to the interests of the consumer and can point to about 25 years of parliamentary life, if necessary, to prove that. However, neither the Minister nor the Opposition Front Bench have fully addressed the real point about the views of the Committee that referred the recommendation to us or the views of those who are concerned with the maintenance of jobs in the Liverpool area, with the interests of research chemists or with the future of veterinary care in this country. I am deeply affronted by that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This country has always been in the forefront of scientific research. The present Government are doing their best to dissipate research units and have done considerable harm to the interests of research by the decisions they have taken on their own Ministry and research units, but we shall not debate that this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What deeply concerns me is that the case has not been made for this ban, and certainly not beyond one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
year, unless the Government are prepared to monitor extremely closely what is happening, what real scientific evidence there is and what constraints they believe will be developed if we go along that path. They have in no way addressed the effect on our trade of allowing this ban to stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has a responsibility to look at the effects of all the legislation that flows from the Community and I am distressed that the Government do not seem to be making strongly enough the case that will genuinely protect interests in the way they should.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to make a long speech. Many of my points have been admirably made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a distinction between amendments (a) and (b). All that amendment (a) does is change "support" for the Council's decision to "notes" the decision—a procedural point that would appeal to my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich. The matter has been dealt with by MAFF and the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation is highly critical in paragraphs 7.14 and 7.15 of the document that was produced on 18 December. I realise that "noting" as distinct from "supporting" makes little difference to what occurs, but it gives us an opportunity to say, "We don't think we should come along here after the event—when things have been decided over our heads, without our having any influence—and give 'support' to what has been done, although 'noting' still allows the Government to carry on as they did previously." It is a form of criticism of MAFF's position, and I appeal to my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich to consider amendment (a), although amendment (b) contains much stronger distinctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me elaborate on amendment (a). Paragraph 7.14 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As our Report demonstrates, this proposal is of clear political significance. We are told by the Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that a decision must be made by 31 December 1993; there is thus some urgency."</p></blockquote>
There was urgency in answering the questions that I raised on an earlier paragraph. The Minister shot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
through them briefly in his opening statement. It is now 9 February and we are dealing with the matter retrospectively, although it clearly has an impact on the future, because the moratorium continues to the end of the year and we are seeking to lay down markers for what the position should be when the year has ended. I hope that as we approach the end of that year we shall have a chance, through reports to the Select Committee referred back to the Standing Committee, to take another look at the Commission's specific proposals. I hope that we shall not be in the position that we are in today, where the procedures of the European Community are taking place after the event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7.14 continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yet although we received the deposited Commission document on 6 October, the Minister did not submit his Explanatory Memorandum on the proposal until 29 November. An Explanatory Memorandum should normally be submitted within 10 working days of deposit of the document to which it relates."</p></blockquote>
That was not adequately covered by the Minister's initial statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7.15 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the deadline … the fact that a formal proposal has yet to be put forward by the Commission is not relevant. The Government has failed to discharge its scrutiny responsibilities to the House. In view of the importance of the proposal, this is especially regrettable."</p></blockquote>
We should take on board what the Select Committee said, even if it only means that we change "supporting" to "taking note" of what is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) is the more substantial amendment. I should like the Committee to consider it carefully, because it may not say quite as much as my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich suggested. It adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the interests of informed consumer choice"—</p></blockquote>
about which we have had a great deal of discussion—
	<br><blockquote><p>"presses for the moratorium to be continued, at a minimum"—</p></blockquote>
I shall come to the reason for that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"until such time as it is possible to label products as derived from BST-treated cows."</p></blockquote>
The amendment refers to "at a minimum" because the motion relates to a moratorium period of until only 31 December 1994. It is theoretically possible that, in the meantime, a system of labelling products could be found. That is not practical, but it is theoretically possible so that that eventuality is covered. The final part of the amendment relating to the moratorium operating
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"until such time as it is possible to label products"</p></blockquote>
does not actually state that products will have to be labelled. It states that when we have a procedure, such as tracers, which makes labelling possible, then that should be the end of the moratorium period. The amendment would leave it open, theoretically, for labelling to be introduced then. That would therefore give my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich another bite at the cherry. We would have a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
procedure under which it would be possible to have labelling, and we would then have to decide at some later stage whether we actually had that labelling. I doubt whether my arguments appeal fully because there are more points of substance that divide us about the need to have labelling in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for a considerable moratorium on BST has been marshalled by the European Commission. That would leave the moratorium in place for another seven years. I grant that the arguments are of an economic and social nature and are not of a scientific and medical nature and that the European Parliament has asked for an indefinite moratorium to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Commission's arguments are examined, we see that there are some points in them that relate to the exploitation of animals. The Commission states that there would be a significant fall in consumption of milk and dairy products and a fall in beef consumption which is difficult to quantify. It refers to the impact that that is likely to have on exports as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Commission believe that that is likely to occur? It is because of consumer opposition. That attitude has been reflected in various public opinion surveys, not just in this country, but in France, Italy and Germany. We are talking about something that would operate throughout the European Union. If the potential impact of BST is serious, the argument for labelling becomes considerable. It would then mean that there is an avenue open to people, as they could look at the label and decide whether they wanted to buy the BST-induced product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Market factors are important and significant because of people's feelings and understanding about the importance of animal welfare. The arguments for animal welfare have been fully set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe, but I want to ask whether it is justifiable to subject cows to repeated injections and increased risk of mastitis and other welfare risks merely to increase milk production, when the Economic Union suffers from a surplus of dairy products and when the consequences would be a reduction of those products and a problem with markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might also be felt that, despite the scientific and medical evidence and reports—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman's</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that three Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and three Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>

Some may feel, however, despite the evidence of the appropriate committee in Europe on medical and scientific evidence, that if matters concerning the regime for animals are so unhealthy, it may have some

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
knock-on effect. So far as users and consumers of dairy products are concerned, the fear will continue. The argument about animal welfare is a substantial one. Many people have a great concern for animal welfare and, if they are not able to have the appropriate information about the nature of dairy products, there will be a problem with sales. This is an increasing problem because many people take these concerns seriously and, perhaps, rightly so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.28 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward O'Hara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee and the Minister know that I am not one to treat lightly questions about the use of additives to animals and in food products. I have pressed the Minister hard on questions in the past and he knows that I demand a large burden of justification. However, I always try to keep my eye clearly on the balance of relevant considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central issue before us today is BST as an agricultural product enhancer. It is a biotechnical product like many others in use. They are accepted because they provide economy, efficiency, increased yield and profitability. It seems that BST does all this, yet there are questions about its acceptance, although there are no questions about the acceptance of similar products, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich made clear in her first set of questions to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments against the use of BST must be based on empirical criteria. These criteria have been mentioned several times by the Minister—quality, efficacy and, most important, safety. There seems to be no question about the quality of the product. As I understand the literature, which I have read carefully, synthetic BST is indistinguishable from natural BST in milk. That was the point of my questions about pirate batches of milk which, if there was a labelling system, might contain synthetic BST which was not labelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards efficacy, there seems to be abundant evidence that BST would produce an increased yield. The figure that I have seen is 15 per cent. and I have to accept that. I understand from the Minister's answers that its introduction would have little effect on the UK dairy industry. There might be a reduction in some smaller units in favour of some of the larger ones, but I understand that there would be a more dramatic effect—again, I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich—on small producers on the continent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is better aware than I am of the weekend hobby farmers in Germany, for example, who, rather as people have allotments in this country, have a couple of cows or pigs and can reap generous subsidies for them. The structure of the industry on the continent is quite different from its structure in this country, and that seems to me to be the driving force behind EC recommendations for the introduction of BST. The milk lake is a red herring. We are talking not about quotas and production, but about productivity, which is quite a different concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
There are two aspects to safety—safety for the cow and safety for the consumer. BST has been tested exhaustively by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and cleared on both counts. Similarly, in 1990 the VPC cleared it for consumers, but left some question marks over side effects on the cow, which we must be concerned about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European CVMP has cleared it on three counts—quality, efficacy and safety—but recommended a moratorium for the duration of milk quotas, which seems to be more related to the CAP and milk quotas rather than to the sorts of consideration that we should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no proof of physiological side effects on humans. I know that some consumer watchdogs have raised a logical stopper that it is not enough to prove that is dangerous, one must prove that it is safe. To do that is, if now logically, certainly practically, impossible. If one queries that, the answer is that it is a problem for the chemical industry and not for those who do not wish to see BST introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about consumer resistance? There have been suggestions that the introduction of BST might result in a 11 per cent. reduction in the consumption of dairy products, but I can see no conclusive evidence to support that. One does not know. There is evidence of consumer resistance to additives identified by EC labelling, but I certainly see no great evidence that, in the main, such additives significantly deter consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labelling is important. I understand the issue of consumer choice, but I am exercised by the question of labelling and, again, that point was made to the Minister. For example, there has been the suggestion about placing a tracer in BST. If the Minister recalls, I asked about a pilot batch of milk containing synthetic BST which was labelled. How would that be distinguished from milk with natural BST? Presumably, if it was a pilot batch, it would not have a tracer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seem to be severe practical difficulties in labelling and I was interested in what my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich said about the benefits to the printing industry of labelling. One is in fact talking about a difficult, and perhaps not even feasible exercise, to uncertain purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there is a practical consequence of labelling which I invited the Minister to consider, but he did not give me the answer I expected. The difficulty and expense of labelling these products could have significant economic effects on the introduction of BST in the market. The benefits might not be worth the efforts in that they would be counteracted by the cost of a labelling system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to my earlier point, everyone agrees that biotechnical products should be tested exhaustively, I understand that BST has been tested and has given strong satisfaction in respect of its quality, efficacy and safety. Why then does it have to cross the so-called fourth socio-economic hurdle, which the European
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
Commission wishes to impose? Which other productivity enhancers have to do that? Are the criteria applied to be scientific or are they to be sociological, ethical or commercial?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that perhaps narrow commercial considerations lie behind the pressure for a continued lengthy moratorium on the introduction of BST and I suggest that that is misguided. What is at stake in this whole debate is the competitive future of three major European industries in which the United Kingdom is very strong and to the fore—the agricultural, chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Dista factory is in an area of Speke that straggles the Speke and Knowsley boundaries. It is no exaggeration to say that the long-term future of that large, expensive facility, which offers 150 jobs and £100 million of investment, is at stake. The company, in order to qualify for registration of its product, has had to invest heavily in building a manufacturing facility and showing that it meets fully the required standards. It is no exaggeration to state that there are jobs, other than those which are related directly to the production of BST, at stake if BST does not go into production under licence. I have to be concerned about that when, as I said earlier, I take the balance of considerations into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BST has been tested and I cannot see that much further testing can be applied to it, but if there is to be a moratorium, it must be used to the best effect, particularly in consideration of the use of BST in America, where, I understand, it is now approved by the FDA. If there is to be a moratorium, it must be used to take a close look at the effects of the non-introduction of BST on the UK dairy industry in a global market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to reply to this important and interesting debate. I will try to deal with the points which have been raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and, if I do not deal with them properly and at length today, I will certainly write to hon. Members in greater detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I disagree with them, I will start with the points made in a long, well-informed and carefully made speech by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe. He started by acknowledging that he accepts that the criteria in this country—and those in other licensing systems across the world—incorporated and enshrined in the Medicines Act 1968, of safety, quality and efficacy, have all been fulfilled. Safety includes, for the purposes of this definition and for all other definitions in respect of medicines, the safety of the animal or the human concerned in the treatment. In that respect, BST has passed all those hurdles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a number of other points, relating to consumer choice and to animal welfare, which we dealt with at some length earlier. However, I am happy to refer to them again today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wanted to know whether BST would have a welfare effect on the animals concerned.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
We do not believe that that is the case. It is the scientific, respectable, well-researched and detailed opinion that, if used properly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, BST should not cause general health or welfare problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, some studies have suggested that BST causes increased incidence of mastitis, while others have found no increase whatever. Results are difficult to analyse, but increased incidence of mastitis is directly linked to milk yield, trial site and stage of lactation. There is no evidence of a significant, direct treatment-related increase of mastitis. There is, however, some evidence that BST treatment results in reduced severity and duration of mastitis. As a matter of fact, mastitis occurs more in low yielding cows than in high yielding cows. The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East earlier made points about the injection site and I dealt with that earlier in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe referred to the metabolic exhaustion of cows. Nutrient demands alter in BST-treated cows, but they do that in all cows giving similar milk yields. Those are normal, physiological responses to milk production; they occur throughout lactation in all dairy cows. They are adapted responses and reverse in response to reduced milk production. Blood biochemical levels return to normal in both BST-treated and untreated cows after lactation. Treated cows regain body condition during the dry period and calve in similar body condition to untreated control cows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich asked about consumer interests. There is much misleading information about the product. Some consumer views seem to be based on an incomplete understanding of the likely use and uptake of BST. However, we naturally take them seriously and neither the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe, nor the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich needs any credentials for their defence of consumer interests, which are well known in the Committee and elsewhere. We shall consider those interests carefully before reaching a final view on BST and, as I said earlier, we shall be undertaking a formal consultation with consumers and all others in the industry in this moratorium year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then made a statement about the likely effect on the agricultural sectors. It is difficult to have a reliable view on this. There are a number of studies. The Commission has produced one that disagrees patently with that done at Wye College. This is an area where opinion differs considerably. We shall use the year to see the effect in the United States, which will be an important part of our consideration of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman referred to the rural economy, to which the Government attach the highest importance. He is a little foolish to link BST as the be-all and end-all to the future success of the rural economy, because plainly it is not the whole story. Substantial structural changes will take place in farming over the next few years, for reasons of which we are all aware.

I propose to deal with the question of the market and the global situation when I reply to the points made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. Her speech, if I may say so, was entirely in keeping with her robust good sense on such matters. Again, I confirm that in my Ministry and in the House the hon. Lady has a reputation for a profound knowledge and defence of consumer interests. I, therefore, take a great deal of notice and care of what she says. She represents a formidably important dairy farming area and knows about the management of the milking herd. This is an important subject which has not fully been taken account of this morning. There have been hugely substantial improvements in milk hygiene over the years and we shall be monitoring with care the evidence that exists on all the points that she made on animal welfare, on which, again, I accept she always has care for the interests of the animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Commission's motives, it would be unwise in the present climate for junior Ministers to make any assertions, but between these four walls and in the safe knowledge that it will go no further, I think its motives are entirely unclear in this matter and, between the hon. Lady and myself, I agree with the views that she has expressed. She is right in my judgment—I hope she accepts that that is not said in a patronising way—and I wholly agree with her on the question of operating a ban on trade of this type. It would clearly be a grave disadvantage to the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East was playing fast and loose, although he does not mean to, with Britain's interests if he thinks that on an issue such as this, where there is clear fundamental scientific evidence that all the criteria have been met, we should go in for a trade ban. That would be thoroughly deleterious to our interests as a world trading nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I intend no discourtesy, but I must deal with these points. A trade ban would be the height of folly and the Government have no intention whatever of agreeing to one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned the position under GATT. She is aware of the procedures for dealing with these matters, but there is absolutely no reason why we should even dream of using them because there is no scientific evidence to prove that any BST-treated milk presents in any way or in any form an unacceptable hazard to human, animal or plant health and safety. All the appropriate authorities agree that that is not the case with BST and a failure to abide by the agreements would result in a formal challenge that would require a change to the situation. We simply could not afford to get into this kind of argument. It is absolutely idiotic from the point of view of our own interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for biotechnology developments, the hon. Lady is absolutely right. BST's development and commercialisation in Europe has a potential global market estimated to reap £60,000 million by the year 2000. It is a potentially gigantic market and the industry holds a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
position of extreme importance to our trading interests. A continuing ban on BST would undoubtedly and clearly, as the hon. Member for Knowsley, South rightly says, give discouraging signals to potential biotechnology development and provide an unwelcome precedent for banning such products on entirely non-scientific grounds. It would create uncertainty about the regulatory requirements in this country and in Europe and threaten future investment and employment in Europe. I urge the hon. Gentleman to have care when bandying around ideas of this type, which can only cause profound unease to those seeking to invest in this country to our great and continuing advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East moved both the amendments. I think that I have dealt with all the points that he raised. I apologised to members of the Committee at the beginning of my speech, I thought handsomely, for the fact that they had not received the documents on time. I apologise again. The reasons where plain and I told the Committee what they were. I assure the hon. Gentleman that in future, where we cannot produce documents for such reasons, we should and will produce a holding memorandum explaining the situation in good time. As I said, I believe that I have dealt with all the hon. Gentleman's arguments. We wholly reject the suggestion that we should go for the Commission's seven-year ban.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the important speech by the hon. Member for Knowsley, because he touched on some of the issues at the heart of this requirement. I acknowledge his doughty support for the consumer interest, which I share. He has genuinely tried in all our debates, as has the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, to balance the important consumer interest with the other issues, which cannot simply be dismissed on the basis of misleading and ill-informed information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is disagreement about the likely effects of BST and we must be clear that more work must be done. There will be more studies and further evidence will be produced. We shall have evidence from the United States on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that we have dealt with his arguments about animal welfare and labelling. We may not all agree, but they have been aired thoroughly in this morning's debate. He used the words that I wish I had thought of when I referred to this matter. We must keep a sense of proportion about labelling. Labelling is important but it would present practical difficulties and is unwarranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the use of scientific criteria. Is this system of the safety, quality and efficacy, which has served the world well, to be overturned just because of a lack of understanding about its relevance? Certainly the competitive future of Great Britain is an important matter. After all, what are the hazards presented by BST? All the appropriate, respectable scientific authorities are satisfied that, when used as recommended by the manufacturers, BST is safe both for those who handle the product and for consumers of food from treated animals.

I want to refer to a point made by the hon. Member for Knowsley, South, or it may have been the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, about the use of BST in America. In the trial period of its use there was no evidence of any consumer resistance to its use in treated milk. We have to wait till the end of the full-year trial in the United States to see whether there has been consumer resistance. The grocery distributors in America have stated that there is no evidence of any consumer resistance, despite some quite heavy media-inspired propaganda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I come to the point made by the hon. Member for Knowsley, South—so that the Committee may settle this matter in their own minds—about the direct effects a long-term ban would have on the industry of this country. Two companies would be directly affected by any failure to licence BST in the United Kingdom—Monsanto and Lilly. The European Community accounts for 25 per cent. of Monsanto's business worldwide. It employs 1,830 people in the United Kingdom, with annual sales of over £350 million, 53 per cent. of which is imported. Lilly employ 2,100 people with a UK turnover of £250 million, 60 per cent. of which goes for export. A prohibition would involve the write-off of significant development costs. The Lilly factory at Speke, represented robustly by the hon. Gentleman, represents an investment of £40 million and up to 150 jobs would be placed at risk. It was designed and built currently to supply the United Kingdom and European markets. Such a ban would go wholly against everything that the Government would want to do to show that we are a free trading country with interests in a global market, and secure and confident in our ability to secure global markets for our products. If we were to ban a product such as this, without any scientific evidence that it should be banned, we should send the most serious signals to those who wish to invest in Europe and in this country, to the great disadvantage of the interests of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will feel that we have dealt in depth with the very important issues that have been raised. We shall, of course, listen to all the views expressed on both sides of the Committee. I apologise once again for the lack of the correct papers and I hope that I have explained the reason for it.
