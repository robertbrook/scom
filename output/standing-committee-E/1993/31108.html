	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Transport of Animals</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Nicholas Soames)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject of our debate is one that the Government consider to be of the highest importance. Animal welfare is a matter of great, justifiable and instinctive concern to the British people. The Government share those feelings in every particular and to the utmost degree. Our concern is not only for animals in this country, where their welfare is already subject to excellent and rigorous safeguards, but to extend our standards to the rest of the community. That is particularly necessary for animal transport, because animals can now be freely traded within the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to ensure a common set of rules, so that all member states operate to the same high standards of care. However, it is not enough to adopt a set of rules if there is no intention of applying them rigorously. No amount of hand-wringing or vapouring will make any difference to the welfare of animals in Europe if the rules are not properly enforced. The strongest possible enforcement is needed and we are doing our utmost to ensure that that is achieved. We are clear in our own minds that enforcement standards are nowhere near high enough. We seek new measures that will be easy to enforce, and we shall continue to impress on other member states and the Commission the need for proper and rigorous enforcement throughout the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are designed to cover issues that were left outstanding when the original directive on animal transport was adopted in 1991. That directive required the Commission to produce a repeat and, where necessary, proposals on maximum journey times, feeding, watering and resting periods, loading densities and vehicle standards. Document 8441/93 contains those proposals. It is accompanied by an explanatory memorandum in which the Commission explains the basis on which the proposals were drawn up, including the detailed advice that the Commission received from the Scientific Veterinary Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pending the implementation of the further Community rules, member states are permitted to operate national rules in certain areas. The United Kingdom has taken advantage of that provision. In particular, it has maintained a 15-hour maximum feeding and watering interval for farm animals in transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are aware that differences in welfare standards between member states can put our industry at a competitive disadvantage and, most important, deny animals the welfare safeguards that we know to be suitable and essential. We therefore welcome the Commission's proposals as a starting point for discussion. The Government invited more than 500 interested organisations and individuals to comment on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
proposals. We received 86 replies and a full set of those responses has been deposited in the Library. The responses have been summarised in the supplementary explanatory memorandum submitted on 19th November, which also summarises the progress made in the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The negotiations are exceedingly difficult and complex. I need hardly point out that some member states do not give animal welfare the high priority that is instinctively given by the United Kingdom. Many difficulties have arisen over detailed aspects of the Commission's proposals, which were themselves complex and in some respects inadequately justified scientifically. For example, the proposals on poultry transport were generally considered to be totally impractical and they are expected to be dropped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issues, however, relate to the treatment of the main livestock species during transport. I am glad to say that the principle of giving animals proper care, including water, food and rest, has not been disputed, although the detailed form of those controls remains to be resolved. As I said, those negotiations are now being conducted in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular issue of the highest importance is the question of limits on long journeys. I am fully aware that the absence from the Commission's proposals of a specific journey limit for slaughter animals has disappointed many people. There are, however, several forms that such limitations can take and the idea of a simple limit on journeys of animals to the slaughterhouse was rejected by the Commission because it would be too simple to evade. The Government's top priority is to find a legal framework of proper welfare safeguards that will work in practice and be easy to enforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also wish to ensure that the Community rules are comprehensive and, in that context, I am pleased to say that we expect the proposals to be amended to include sheep in the new requirements. We have fought hard to achieve that, given the extensive trade in sheep in the Community for which proper welfare standards are clearly required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timetable for the adoption of the new measures has, to some extent, been driven by the prospect of Greece taking over the presidency on 1 st January next year. Greece has already stated that animal welfare issues will not progress while it holds the chair. Therefore, the current discussions are regarded as a window of opportunity that may not occur again for some time, and we are supporting the Belgian presidency in its efforts to reach agreement at the Agriculture Council in the week beginning 13th December. I am especially grateful to the Committee for agreeing to hold this debate at a date that will enable us to meet that timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, I assure the Committee that the Government are pressing with great vigour for measures that will lead to major improvements in animal welfare in the Community, and which will be properly enforceable and reflect the great concern that exists in the country that animals should be afforded the highest possible standards of protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that the Government have sought hard to reach a workable agreement. Will the Minister give us a definition of the waiting periods? Clearly, any agreements on the transport of animals must define precisely not only waiting periods, but watering periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
Furthermore, many people wish to see a clear definition of the link between drivers' hours and the transport of animals. Unless such definitions are included in the measure, considerable doubts will exist about its effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister satisfied that the enormous differences in the interpretations of the rules from one country to another can be monitored? For example, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that the changes with regard to veterinary health are already producing great difficulties for our farming community. We would not support any directives that could not be monitored and enforced. The Minister will know that, in this country, existing rules can be enforced and we want to be sure that that applies to the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the minimum resting period, is the Minister satisfied that the differences between what the United Kingdom has applied in the past and what is being proposed in the directive will be acceptable both in business and animal welfare rights groups? That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because attitudes to animal welfare differ from one country to another, there will almost inevitably be differing scales of monitoring. I accept that if a directive has the force of law, it should in theory apply throughout the Community. Will the Minister assure me that he is prepared to accept the views of those involved in such trade? The proposals should not involve a diminution of our standards. It would be bizarre if, in the name of harmonisation, the British were to accept lower standards for the transport of animals than we have applied hitherto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for the measured and sensible way in which, as usual, she addressed the matter, and for her acknowledgement that we are at present in no-man's land because the Brussels negotiation in respect of this matter is being conducted today. The chief veterinary officers met until late last night. The matter will be considered by the Committee of Permanent Representatives next week, when the chief veterinary officers will meet again in the margins. The situation is fluid and I am not in a position to give specific undertakings, but I shall gladly give the hon. Lady general undertakings where I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect a waiting period to be defined as a time during which animals are rested during transport—that is to say, when the vehicle is stationary. The length of resting periods is under detailed consideration. I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising the difficult problem of drivers' hours. We have managed to do away with that provision. We all know that regulations covering drivers' hours are subject to serious abuses, so that that would be a meaningless method of enforcement. Resting periods are under negotiation. Officials have told me that the position has changed at least three times in the last 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is right to say that it would be bad news if we were not to get a good deal across Europe, but it will be a package deal. As she knows, for cultural and attitudinal reasons there is an almost unbridgeable gap between us and some of our European partners concerning animals. One needs only talk to the Greek Minister about animal welfare fully to appreciate that it is a concept the time for which has not yet arrived in Greece. We must negotiate with such people and secure the best possible deal that is enforceable across Europe. Without that, any such deal is not worth the paper on which it is written. I accept everything that the hon. Lady said about the need for vigorous enforcement.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
She is also right to say that enforcement is the responsibility not of the Commission, but of member states. There is a cultural and attitudinal problem in getting other countries to deal with inspections as we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised the important issue of certifications of animals. I shall not say that that the hon. Lady and I have never crossed swords, but we have found ourselves largely in agreement. Her anxieties about how others in Europe enforce rules that we make are not misplaced. There has been a disgraceful want of proper certification in animal health matters. We have made the most vigorous representations about that not only to the countries concerned but to the Commission and I hope that there will be an improvement in that area. Our vets are keeping a wary eye on the matter. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food made an announcement at the Smithfield show in which she dealt positively with the new arrangements for the inspection of animals entering this country. I hope that that deals with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already dealt with the hon. Lady's final point, but it cannot be overemphasised. The nature of the rules and their enforcement in member countries is the key to the welfare of animals being transported. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with animals being transported provided that they are properly cared for, looked after, watered and fed. There have been some distressing and disturbing incidents—which have been well catalogued and about which we all know—in which the rules have not been kept and in which there has been no enforcement on the other side of the channel. We want the rules to ensure proper enforcement. I do not think that there is a hair's breadth between the hon. Lady and I in terms of what we should like to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister set out a specific timetable. It is important for the Committee to know whether there is any intention to report back to Parliament. The Minister's timetable will carry us through the Committee of Permanent Representatives and to the end of the Session. We should like the Minister to say whether he would be prepared to report back to Parliament—if not to the Committee—the details of the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister will make the customary statement to Parliament following the Agriculture Council on 13th December. I cannot say whether it will be an oral statement or in answer to a written question. We should be happy to provide full briefing to the hon. Lady. The details of this discussion will form an important part of proceedings at the Council next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All Conservatives Members will welcome the efforts of my hon. Friend and his colleagues to improve standards throughout the EC. I wish to question the Minister further on the relationship between the proposed Community-wide regime on animal welfare and the current UK regulations. I was not entirely reassured by his answer to the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). Will it be open to the British Government to enact and enforce rules that are stricter than those agreed at Community level? The risk is that, although we may raise standards in Greece or Spain, for example, through Community-wide agreement, we may create a lowest common denominator type of regulation. That may mean that we shall not be able to enforce reasonable regulations on rogue transporters operating in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, not for the first time, has put his finger on a tricky point. For example, the rules that came into force at the beginning of this year left serious gaps, which the Commission has been considering. While the Commission considered the gaps—on matters such as journey times, watering intervals and so on, referred to in the negotiations—we applied national rules. We shall continue to do so until rules concerning animal transport and welfare are harmonised. At that stage, under the single market rules—as my hon. Friend knows, perhaps better than anyone here—we shall be obliged to perform on a pan-European basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to accept that that is why we are taking such trouble to reach a proper enforceable accomodation that benefits animals throughout the Community, rather than make an unenforceable, synthetic transaction on which we shall not be able to improve. We have to achieve our aim in one bite of the cherry, which is why the current situation is so complex and difficult. My hon. Friend is right to have anxieties, but we hope to bring a package of which he will approve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the report from the Council of Ministers will be oral, not written, so that we can scrutinise the matter properly. We are now engaging in a good scrutiny procedure. We want to see the issues that we have raised, which the Minister promised will be pursued, to be considered when the decision is made. Will the Minister ensure that the report includes the voting record of the different nations at the Council of Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will be happy to make an oral statement. Indeed, there are a number of issues that we should like to be written into the record from the Floor of the House. That is a matter for the hon. Gentleman to put to my right hon. Friend the Lord President of the Council at business questions next week. I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question on voting records now, but I shall look into the matter and let him have an answer. The hon. Gentleman can be assured that voting is pretty much on tribal lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that I represent a rural constituency, where the sheep industry is of prime importance. Many of us are worried about the enforceability of regulations and the Minister is right to be concerned about that. Many of us believe that the transport of live humans in certain Mediterrean countries is just as much a cause for concern as the transport of live animals. I received a communication from the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recently, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Brian Montgomery, the senior agricultural manager with the National Westminster Bank accused the sheep trade of taking short term gains on the live export market and causing the closure of a number of meat plants."</p></blockquote>
That is a bit rich coming from a bank manager. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He said he could see no economic, welfare or promotional benefit from the export of live animals. He blamed the volume of live exports and the lack of home throughput for the failures of some major slaughter plants."</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend disassociate himself from such remarks and promise to be as vigorous and as doughty a defender of the interests of our British farming community as he has recently been of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He represents a most important farming area where this sort of trade is extremely important to farmers who are having a very difficult time. I totally dissociate myself from the remarks to which he referred. The Committee realises that we must balance those perfectly proper and achievable concerns with the fact that this is an important trade for the United Kingdom. It is no secret that we should like to see more animals going out on the hook rather than on the hoof. The carcase trade is at least four times the size of the live trade, but the five trade is important and I assure my hon. Friend that we shall continue to protect and defend the right of fanners to transport animals on the continent, provided that they are humanely and properly handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has been vigourous in driving the Government to seek a proper constitutional basis for a level playing field. Unless we have enforceability in all countries in Europe, our farmers will be disadvantaged by the naturally higher welfare standards that we rightly want in this country. Enforceability and practicality are the keys to the negotiations that are taking place. We certainly acknowledge the great importance of the trade to the agriculture industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all welcome the improvements suggested in the directive on matters such as intervals between resting, feeding and watering for various categories of animals, but some of us would prefer matters to be pressed further—for example, limits on overall journey times. Will the Minister confirm that there are differences of opinion between the Council working groups of various member states about whether there should be overall limits on journey times? Do the Government favour limits on journey times?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many profound differences between the working groups, as the hon. Gentleman would expect. When countries are as diverse as Spain, Greece, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Britain and others, there will be formidable and difficult obstacles to overcome, and that is part of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are taking full account of journey limits in trying to arrive at what will inevitably be a compromise package.The hon. Gentleman asked whose side we are on, and the answer is that we are on the side of the animals and of achieving the best possible deal for their welfare, not only in this country but right across Europe. The hon. Gentleman knows that I would be less than frank if I did not tell him that we shall have to compromise on important issues. I am afraid that we shall never please everyone in the conclusion to which we shall come, but I hope that he will accept that journey times, and the detailed form that limits of any sort should take, are central to the entire negotiation. I am not in a position to go further than that at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that most people in the House, like most in the country, would want to encourage the farmers of our food and farm animals in their desire to promote the welfare of those animals in our service? Will he further accept that there is not much of a problem with the transport of breeding animals, nor is there too great a problem in relation to animals intended for fattening overseas, but the biggest problem is with animals taken for slaughter both within the United Kingdom and throughout the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
There is proper public disgust when people see spent chickens, for example, having to travel 600 miles because they will be worth a penny more, or when animals travel for long journeys in inhumane conditions. Perhaps I should have told the Committee that I am an adviser to the International Fund for Animal Walfare, but my concerns date from my time in the Northern Ireland Office when I was a less substantial Minister than my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to make the point that the great majority of British farmers have a real concern for their stock which they treat very properly. The regulations governing animal welfare in this country are of a high standard and there is no point in pretending otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share my hon. Friend's worry about the trade in live animals for slaughter and our judgment is that animals travelling for whatever reason must be properly cared for. There should be no discrimination in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the improvements that we are succeeding in making in Europe is in persuading some of our European partners that to handle animals in an insensitive manner is not only cruel to the animals but extremely foolish of them because the beasts that are to be slaughtered lose their quality. That is totally outside their interests. That is not only a cultural problem but a perfectly sensible commercial point, which I hope will produce an improvement. I know of my hon. Friend's interest in that matter and I assure him that we are conscious of the need for a regime that covers everything. Animals that travel, for whatever reason, should be properly cared for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) by pressing the Minister more strongly on the same question. I have often heard the Minister wax lyrical about the difficulties of persuading other members of the European Community to pay any heed to the regulations laid down by the Council of Ministers, or anyone else. I see from the notes that have been provided that in areas where there is 24-hours limit, people are guilty of taking animals on a 60-hour journey. It is difficult to see any real way of regulating that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that the Minister should have admitted to something that the British people know—that in the Council of Ministers tribal interests come to the fore rather than logic or objectivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the transport of animals for immediate slaughter is unnecessary. I was rather disappointed that the Minister should have rolled over and kicked his legs in the air at the farm lobby. I give way to no one in my support for the National Farmers Union of Scotland, especially in the Forth valley. It is not in the interests of that body or anyone else to have animals transported for 15 or 24 hours before slaughter. That is not in the long-term interest of the British farmer, because if the slaughtering goes to Europe, the breeding will eventually follow, and we shall stop being the prime meat exporter to Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister urge those who negotiate on our behalf to press for an eight-hour and 500-mile journey limit for animals for slaughter. Would not that be much more logical than the doing-our-best attitude that he has pressed so far?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman faces both ways at the same time—a skill that will lead to his coming seriously unstuck one day. I shall draw his remarks to the attention of the National Farmers Union, which, I am sure, will be grateful for his support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On journey times, as I have told the hon. Gentleman, no amount of vapourising or handwringing from him will benefit one single animal unless the rules that are established on a pan-European basis are clearly enforceable and are decent for the welfare of animals. The hon. Gentleman is being ridiculous when he says that Minister roll over with their legs in the air. We are in the middle of deeply complicated negotiations, during which we and everyone else will try to arrive at an honourable accommodation but there will inevitably be compromises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the hon. Gentleman to sit there and bang on about eight-hour or 14-hour limits. We must achieve a workable package that protects animals and can be enforced, and that is precisely what we shall do. Journey limits, as the hon. Gentleman says, are an important part of the equation, but they are part of an overall negotiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Committee as an observer. All Back Benchers speak only for themselves and their constituents, but the Committee will know that I am chairman of the all-party animal welfare group, and I do not believe that there is a great deal of difference between my opinions and those of other members of my committee from both sides of the House. I am extremely grateful—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman about to ask a question or is he anticipating the debate that will begin shortly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have only recently entered Parliament, but I have no doubt that the Minister will regale me with even more bumptious deliveries in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pressing the long-term interests of farmers, which lie in keeping the slaughter of animals in Britain rather than transferring it to Europe. I therefore represent the interests of the National Farmers Union in the long term better than the hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) who spoke on behalf of his own agricultural constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much vague talk, so will the Minister tell us specifically what is the journey limit for which Ministers will press for animals being taken to Europe for slaughter, or are such animals to be treated in the same way as those being taken for fattening or for onward breeding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must allow his leg to be pulled a little.

I do not dissent from some of the hon. Gentleman's comments. I have recently written to all the major farming organisations and travelling organisations reminding them of their obligations to animal welfare and the transport of animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On journeys, as I tried to explain frankly to the hon. Gentleman, I cannot tell him anything of the detail of the negotiation because positions are changing all the time. I can only repeat that, in order to secure the welfare of our animals, travelling for whatever reason across Europe, we wish to achieve the best possible transaction that is consistent with proper enforcement. That remains our position. I hope that many of the hon. Gentleman's questions will be answered after the Agriculture Council has met on 13th December.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever rules are agreed—I accept that for some members of the European Community there will be an improvement in regulations but in this country there will be a diminution—will my hon. Friend ensure the availability in each European country of the name of an office, with a telephone and fax number, to which drivers in the transport industry will be able to submit, anonymously or not, allegations of gross ill-treatment of animals. I understand that the European Commission will not itself be enforcing the rules, but it would be sensible to suggest to member countries that they let the transport unions and others know to whom complaints should be made and who will investigate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a helpful suggestion which I shall discuss with the state veterinary service and the local authorities. It is to the state veterinary service that those complaints should be made. However, his idea is good and we shall see what we can do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend may know, we have considered tightening up the form that I want handed to each driver at the beginning of his journey to remind him of his obligations in the transportation of animals. It would clearly set out the journey plan and would be a good idea to include a telephone number. I cannot think of any reason why we should not do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of us who lean towards a limit on journey times must accept for the time being the Minister's veiled assurances that that is central to the negotiations. I realise the difficulties in the negotiations and, therefore, in revealing details to the Committee. However, will he reassure us that, in attempting to reach a resolution with other member states, the views of organisations such as the RSPCA and Compassion in World Farming are being argued. Both those organisations have drawn to our attention the need to review the design and construction of the vehicles that transport the animals. What improvements do the Government suggest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. Plainly, he is right. I should like to be more frank, but I cannot. I assure him that in the negotiations we are taking fully into account the case for journey time limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to assure him about his concern on the views of the RSPCA. However, in recent weeks, it has wasted a huge sum of supporter's money by placing advertisements in this country and lobbying Ministers who are wholly supportive of the need to improve the requirements of animals travelling in Europe. Every penny of that money, which was wasted in a feckless and foolish way, should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
have been spent advertising in those countries that do not enforce animal welfare regulations and which know little or nothing of them. That campaign was a total and utter waste of supporters' money and I hope that the RSPCA will be held to account for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not us that the RSPCA needs to persuade; we are wholeheartedly and irreversibly committed to the improved welfare of animals while travelling. It is to the Spanish, Greeks, Italians and French that the RSPCA should turn its attention. It should stop trying to whip up a frenzy of support in Britain when, as we all know, the British people favour better and honourable treatment of animals. We have a long history of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was unaware of the fact that I am afforded the privilege of asking questions as well as making a speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will hon. Friend clarify a matter over which a dispute has arisen? Since the abolition of frontier controls on 1 January 1993 and the effective abolition of lairages at ports, veterinary inspections may now be carried out prior to the export of live animals for slaughter, in particular sheep, at any one of a number of points. It is suggested abroad—I put it no stronger than that—that that examination may take place up to 25 days before the export of the animal. I asked Christopher Barclay, an excellent researcher in the science and environment section of the Library, to check that for me. I quote from a letter that he sent me yesterday, in which he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I checked with the Ministry of Agriculture who told me that animals do still have to be examined by a vet on the day of export, but that the certificate remains valid for a number of days thereafter."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that an export licence could be valid for a considerable time, during which the health of the animal or animals could change. Will the Minister clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am able to clarify that. The inspection of animals may take place up to 48 hours before departure and the certificate will last only for the length of the journey. As my hon. Friend knows, we shall always follow up any such queries. If he can give me further details about that rumour, I shall give him a more vigorous and detailed response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pursue further the question of the overall journey limit. The Minister claims to be on the side of the animals, although he thinks that the best way in which to further their interests is through honourable compromise. The Minister must be aware that the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Denmark have already said that they support a 12-hour limit. Even Spain, for its own special reasons, supports that and the Germans are about to make a positive proposal for an eight-hour limit. If we add our support, that would be six out of 12. Would that not provide the b asis for an hourable compromise? When the proposal is put to the Council of Ministers on 13 or 14 December, will the Government support the Germans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I despair of trying to satisfy the hon. Gentleman I can add nothing to what I have already said. We are in the middle of difficult and protracted negotiations. I have set out our position this morning and I can do no more than that. Of course, we want all the friends we can find—we have few friends as it is. Every single ally will inevitably be raked in to help us to get the deal we want. As I have already said, we shall have to reach a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
compromise, as we do on all such negotiations, but we want to ensure that the end result will significantly improve the lot of travelling animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although everyone is in favour of high standards in the European Community, there is concern about standards in the United Kingdom. We previously debated the trans-shipment of animals on 27 March 1991, when we discussed the document that became the 1991 directive. That directive left British legislation in place and we passed a resolution stating that, during the negotiations, we should have regard to maintaining existing British standards. How far can we take that into account in the current situation? A compromise will involve gains and losses, and some hon. Members are especially worried about the potential losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Gentleman exactly the answer that I gave his hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara). Inevitably, there will be compromises. While we are able to enforce our own national rules, we shall do so. Surer than eggs are eggs, we shall not satisfy everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8441/93, relating to the protection of animals during transport, and supports the Government's intention of seeking to negotiate high standards of care throughout the Community for animals during transport.—	<i>[Mr. Soames.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>11.13 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by apologising to you, Sir James, and to the Minister for being late for the Committee. I was dealing with angry salmon fishermen, who are currently experiencing problems of their own, as the Minister is well aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The excellent contributions from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee demonstrate the wide concern about the welfare of animals being moved within the Community. We welcome the directive as it proposes rules, which even the United Kingdom has lacked, on matters such as stocking density on vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has worsened recently. The number of live animals transported to the Community from the United Kingdom increased from 1.3 million in 1991 to 1.8 million in 1992. The Ministry has been unable to answer questions about the scale of animal movements for this year partly because of the introduction of the single European market and partly because the use of lairages at ports is no longer mandatory—a cause for concern in itself. However, trade estimates suggest a further massive increase in live animal exports. The Minister has said that sheep are excluded from the directive; between two million and three million sheep are transported live. In 1985, only 81,000 sheep were exported; the figure is now three million—a huge increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of the practical difficulties of limiting animal transportation. I know that producers are worried about the added costs. Calves, for instance, will be subject to an eight-hour limit. However, I make it clear that those who read the report of our Committee, that the Opposition firmly believe that meat should be exported on the hook and not on the hoof. Those who encourage the movement of live animals are exporting jobs as well as animals. Jobs will be lost in UK slaughterhouses and in processing.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Farming interests are concerned about limits on hours and the effect on live animal transport. However livestock producers should be thinking more of added value than of the export of live animals. For example, they should consider promoting the sale of British veal, which is produced here in a more humane way, rather than the export of calves, which are then put into the very crates that we believe to be unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's view; I have heard him express it before. Apart from the steps that he says industry should take to encourage trade—in veal and so on—what would the Opposition do under the treaty of Rome specfically to decrease the trade in animals exported on the hoof rather than on the hook? What specific steps would the hon. Gentleman take to achieve that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing a European directive. Although I am willing to talk about our policy in great detail, this is not the appropriate forum. However, the treaty of Rome needs to be amended on the classification of animals as agricultural products. It would help us to control live animal transport if animals were classified as sentient. More consideration would thus be given to their welfare than is the case at present. The Minister is speaking of the difficulties in getting agreement with other member states. However, I believe that some member states have more good will than the Minister allows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point links to what my hon. Friend the Minister said about the need to raise awareness in other member states. The hon. Gentleman spoke about classifying animals as sentient. If we then impose welfare rules that increase the cost of transporting live animals, the economic and welfare arguments will both be in favour of slaughter near to the place of breeding and fattening. That will make the economics work with and for welfare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a sensible point of which I hope the Minister has taken note. The Minister might also consider whether given the huge sums of money available within the CAP a great proportion of which is not used in a practical or meaningful way, one way to encourage refrigerated carcase trade would be to give it some assistance and support. That might equalise the economics. The Minister might wish to discuss the matter in the Council of Ministers
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made an unfair attack on the RSPCA campaign. The RSPCA has done everyone a service by raising the issue, along with other organisations, such as Compassion in World Farming. A campaign, recently launched involving the Belray Foundation, the RSPCA and other organisations, includes a film which shows the most appalling treatment of live animals. It shows animals so weak when they arrived at the point of embarkation that they had to be lifted out of the trucks by crane. A bull had to be lifted by its horns. It shows animals being kicked out of transporters by the handlers and falling on to the ground. Some broke their legs and others were paralysed and left for hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just demonstrated why the RSPCA's campaign is fatuous. I saw that video—it was grotesque and appalling. But those offences against those animals occurred not in Britain but in Spain, France,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
Italy and Greece. The RSPCA's campaign is absurd and ridiculous because every penny should have been spent on swaying public opinion in countries that are not interested in animal welfare. We have a wholehearted desire to see the animal welfare record of those countries improved. Some countries in Europe simply do not have a clue and the RSPCA should spend its money in those countries instead of on fatuous campaigns in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to differ with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reply briefly. We are going beyond the terms of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made many of the right noises and I am sure that he is sincere, but the RSPCA and I want to know when we shall get results. It was mentioned that some member states think that a maximum journey time rule would be impractical. Did the Government say at that meeting that a journey time limit was impractical and therefore unenforceable? Do the Government believe that a maximum journey time rule is enforceable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it abundantly clear—I know that the hon. Gentleman is a supporter of animal welfare—that journey times form a part of the package. We take into account the nature of journey times. The RSPCA's campaign is pointless not just because it occurred in the wrong place, but because it advocates journey time limits as the answer to all animals' problems. It is not. We need a package of measures to cover all the issues and to best secure animal welfare throughout Europe. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the undertaking that he seeks. It is not a case of every position being set in tablets of stone and written by the RSPCA, CIWF or the British Field Sports Society. The negotiation is Government to Government, with the purpose of coming up with an enforceable package for animal welfare and the travel of animals across Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes my point. The RSPCA campaigned—this is my last point on the matter—for a maximum journey time of eight hours, which is reasonable. That goal should be clear and we should campaign for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the directive's package of measures on intervals, different species, and so on. The Minister may want to refer to broiler hens when he responds. I note that the maximum journey time suggested in the directive is six hours. Will the Minister tell us whether that includes loading and unloading time, as that matter is of some interest to the poultry industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Gentleman's view that the proposals are entirely impractical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman did say that. The proposals are entirely impractical. We are taking the issue of the transportation of hens—back to the drawing board. It is not an easy matter because loading and unloading take a very long time and must be done scientifically. We should not do anything that science does not dictate that we should and we should still be able to create a good package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has noted that problem. I did not say that the proposals were impractical, although I am aware that the directive does not make clear
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
whether loading and unloading time is included, which has a major impact on the difficulties of supplying the major factories. I am sure that we shall return to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister expressed his concern about sheep. Given that the market has grown to such a scale, the matter needs to be carefully considered. I note that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food commissioned research which was published in 	<i>The Veterinary Record</i> on 18th September 1993. It concluded that even after nine hours of transport, sheep required 24 hours of sleep before they recovered from short-term stress and dehydration. A full recovery in terms of stress and live weight took 96 hours. The authors of the document stated that after 96 hours—four days of rest—the sheep were in an acceptable metabolic state to resume their journey. I know that work has been done on sheep transportation, but I do not think that a 24-hour maximum, which goes further than the maximum laid down in this country, is acceptable or welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the issue of lactating cows and pigs. According to the directive, they will have to wait 24 hours for a feeding break. I am not sure whether that is desirable and I hope that the Minister will consider the issue further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we should be looking for an eight-hour overall journey limit. I realise that that will have a substantial impact on the live animal trade, but I believe that we should try to reduce that trade as far as practicable. I accept that the trade of breeding, fattening and so on will continue, I believe that the scale of the live trade is excessive and should be drastically reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich, who has much experience in transport matters, mentioned linking enforcement to tachograph regulations, which would be sensible. We would then have a record that could be checked and enforced. I wonder whether the Minister would consider going further, by licensing haulage companies that move live animals. I am not suggesting a bureaucratic or difficult licensing scheme; I am looking for a simple solution. If hauliers in the European Community break regulations covering the treatment of animals, their licences can be withdrawn. Member states could use that sanction against hauliers who treat animals unacceptably and who break EC rules on the movement of animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the German Government are pressing strongly for a limit on travelling times for slaughter animals. Therefore, the Government, have allies with whom they could work in the European Community—in the Council of Ministers—to introduce maximum journey times for animal transportation. Animal welfare campaigners are looking to the Government to come up with such a measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara) said, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Denmark have shown interest in supporting a maximum journey time. Even Spain has shown such an interest, although that may be in defence of its own interests. Another example of the Government not standing up to too critical an examination of their present support for animal transport regulations is the fact that they restarted the export of animals to Spain. It was stopped initially because of the unacceptable treatment of animals in Spanish slaughterhouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That trade was restarted, even in the light of evidence that after the suspension, Spanish slaughterhouses were still not applying the welfare standards that we would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
expect here or, indeed, that the European Union would expect. Will the Minister consider during our debate whether there is a case for the suspension of the export of animals to Spain, given the evidence of mistreatment at the slaughterhouses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the draft directive has been produced by the Commission. At one time, we were worried that animal welfare would be put under the heading of "subsidiarity". I am pleased, therefore, that the Government accepted that it should not be covered by subsidiarity. If it were, animal welfare would simply be the lowest common denominator within the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that we must argue with other member states for changes. Even though that may be a difficult and protracted business, it is no excuse for individual member states, including ourselves, not to argue for, campaign for and introduce unilaterally, where appropriate, the highest possible animal welfare standards. Not only should we be leading and encouraging by example, but we should be using the treatment of animals and our meat production as a marketing method through which to show consumers that the highest possible welfare standards are maintained. That important marketing aspect has not been exploited by our producers who, in the main, are concerned about the welfare of animals and the setting of high standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive is a step forward but, in many areas, it does not go far enough. In some sectors, it is retrograde, especially with regard to sheep and to maximum feeding and watering times. We want the Minister to seek changes that would improve the directive. Above all, we want him to come out publicly in a campaign for an eight-hour journey limit. Even given the difficulties that the Minister has outlined and the fact that the matter must be argued within the European Community, there are strong reasons for pressing for such a limit. By setting such a target and putting down a marker, the Minister can negotiate with other European states. If he argues strongly enough for that limit, he may win support from other member states—something that may surprise him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.34</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thanet, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that I am here as an observer, and I do not wish to abuse the courtesy that the Committee is affording me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by complimenting my hon. Friend the Minister on his continued support for the work of the all-party group and in particular on the line that he has taken and continues to take in the negotiations relating to the directive. I recently went, with the hon. Member for Worsley (Mr. Lewis), who is the vice-chairman of the group, to see my hon. Friend the Minister. He told us that he intended to take a robust line, and I have no reason to doubt that he is doing so. Hon. Members know that when my hon. Friend is robust, he is robust. That leads me to hope that in the negotiations now taking place he will secure greater concessions from the other European Ministers than those presently in the Commission's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must now drive my hon. Friend the Minister to distraction by returning to the fundamental issue of journey time. The group appreciates that the Minister, his Department and the Government have taken on board that the fixed journey time issue is a central issue, and it accepts
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
that it will be only part of a package of measures that needs to be negotiated and implemented in the short term to improve farm animal welfare, especially in relation to the transport of live animals for slaughter. My hon. Friend knows that the RSPCA, Compassion in World Farming and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have all pressed for an eight-hour journey limit. He will be aware that that request has the backing of Eurogroup—the European group of animal welfare organisations, which meets regularly—and of the European parliamentary Intergroup, which is the European equivalent of the all-party animal welfare group which I had the privilege of attending in September. Members of European Parliaments firmly back the proposal for a maximum journey time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely accept my hon. Friend the Minister's thesis that the United Kingdom has played and continues to play a lead role, and that we have an uphill struggle to educate some of our European colleagues. We are working through Intergroup to establish all-party animal welfare groups in each European Parliament to bring pressure on local Ministers. The deluge of mail generated by the RSPCA campaign and received by my hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was well-intentioned but misdirected. It should properly be directed to those who would most benefit from being shown that there is strong feeling about animal welfare throughout the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister asked the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) what proposals he had to reduce the trade in meat on the hoof. I think that the Committee agrees that the desirable end game is the transport of meat on the hook. There is no reason in this day and age of competent refrigeration why meat should not be transported anywhere in the Community in chilled lorries—not deep frozen but chilled—at a perfectly acceptable standard of quality and hygiene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer to my hon. Friend the Minister is that the imposition of a maximum journey time will inevitably lead to progress towards that end game. If the maximum journey time were to be eight hours, it would become virtually impossible to transport animals such as sheep for long distances for slaughter. We want the slaughter of animals to take place as close as possible to the point of production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it, Sir James, that in commenting upon the European document, I am allowed to comment on what is not in it as well as what is. As my hon. Friend the Minister pointed out, the whole question of sheepmeat is omitted. That is a serious omission because, as I said, I am now able—with the support of the work of a journalist—to offer a little evidence. The trading of sheepmeat on the hoof is a racket within the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) said that he represented a farming constituency. He is rightly concerned about the sheep farmers of the United Kingdom, and so am I. I, too, represent a farming constituency which produces not huge quantities of sheep, but a great many of them, and some of my farmers depend on that for their livelihoods. I come from Dorset where many of my former friends are also dependent on such farming. The last thing that any member of the all-party animal welfare group wants is for damage to be done to the British sheep farming trade. We make that absolutely plain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
I do not believe that the maximum journey time proposals would result in damage to that trade. I understand that the transport of sheep on the hoof represents about 20 per cent. of the export trade. The growth in the French market is so rapid at present that it is abundantly clear that there is room for both countries' producers. We could export all the meat possible and still allow the French to provide the home-produced meat which, apparently, they wish to eat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the cost of transporting British live lambs is, I am told, four times as high as that of transporting carcase meat, there has been an incentive for the farmer because French abattoirs are paying the top price for live British lambs. The racket and scam is that after slaughter, those British lambs are marked with a French abattoir stamp, rendering the meat "home killed" or "French produced". Both those lables attract a premium wholesale price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The net result is that the British carcase trade is suffering because of the live exports. The market price has been brought down by a huge import of live lambs into French abattoirs. I am told that the British abattoir trade is losing about £10 million a year—that is, £5 per lamb—from the loss of the carcase by-product trade in skin, offal, fleece and intestines. That also affects the export of leather goods arising from the fleece.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the work on that aspect has been carried out by a freelance journalist named Penny Lewis, whose article appeared recently in 	<i>The Independent.</i> It shows that the Sisteron abattoir, the largest lamb slaughterhouse in France, has produced some very abnormal statistics in recent months. I understand that, normally, that abattoir would be expected to slaughter about 100,000 to 150,000 lambs a year. For the most recent 12 months, the figure was 560,000, and most of that meat went out stamped "French" or "Home produced in France". There is every reason to suppose that most of those lambs were produced in Wales or, in some cases, the west country or the north of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is keen to ensure the enforcement of European regulations and I believe that that is one area where we can hold the European Community to account and determine that that produce, which is what it is when it reaches the housewife, is properly labelled and marked, and is not fraudulent. If we can achieve that, it is possible that we may begin to reduce the export of meat on the hoof without damaging the export of meat on the hook or the general trade in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned the welfare of animals—their food, watering, lairage and other provision, including rest stops during transport. It is generally accepted by the veterinary profession that the maximum points of stress for animals on their journeys occur during loading and unloading. Inevitably, if large animals are properly fed and watered during travel for long distances across the European Community, there will be a number of points of stress in a four-day journey. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Minister knows about that aspect of the matter rather better than I do because he referred to the time taken to get some fairly truculent sheep or cattle off a lorry into a field or lairage, to feed and water them and to get them back on to the vehicle. That must be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scientific veterinary report, on which the Commission based its note to the Council, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"sea transport of livestock has been greatly improved in recent years and if animals are carried in properly equipped vessels with experienced attendants, their welfare should be good regardless of the distance travelled."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Horses, in particular, suffer from travel by sea. The key words are "experienced attendants". I hesitate to use a pun but, following the recent lifting of restrictions on trade, a significant number of cowboy operators have come into the trade. People who are wholly unqualified are now running animals into and across the European Community, using handlers who are in no way qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly drew attention to the fact that the two pieces of film that he and I have seen, which were produced for the press conference last week by the RSPCA, were not of animals leaving the United Kingdom, but of animals being transported within the European Community. That is what the document is about. It is not simply about the United Kingdom's trade which, I think, most members of the Committee would agree is better than much that happens throughout Europe; it is about the trade throughout the European Community and into the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the film showed cattle leaving Romania and going into Italy, and it was appalling. Another piece of the film was of animals leaving Belgium and travelling south. In the European Community, animals can be transported over enormous distances with very little scrutiny, often in unsuitable transport and handled by people with no qualifications to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Penny Lewis, the journalist to whom I referred, prepared a note for me. I stand to be corrected, but she says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Carriage regulations have become looser since 1 January 1993. The MAFF spot-checks on carriage regulations, i.e. loading, ventilation, food and water stops, are random. MAFF are unable to quote regularity."</p></blockquote>
The note continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The European Commission currently only employs 12 veterinary officers to cover 12 countries. They have stated that their time only allows them to conduct veterinary medical checks at European farms; no regular European tranpsort checks are being carried out. Transporters therefore easily flout what regulations exist for the welfare of animals during transit; chances of being discovered are slim."</p></blockquote>
The argument levelled by the southern European states, which has been translated into the European states, which has been translated into the European document that we are discussing and centres on the difficulty of policing a maximum journey time, does not hold water. It must surely be possible to monitor a maximum journey time for one journey starting at point A and ending at point B, whether the journey time is eight, 10 of 12 hours. If we can establish the principle of the maximum time, it must be easier to monitor that on the tachograph than for 12 veterinary officers to monitor thousands of lorries over millions of miles of European roads with dozens of drivers taking whichever route they choose, which effectively is what the European Community says that it will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the existing regulations are unsatisfactory. My colleagues and I strongly believe that the maximum journey time represents the way forward. In the interim, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to bring pressure to bear on his colleagues in the Council of Ministers to impress upon them the way in which the regulations are being flouted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister and his right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food have done a sterling job in maintaining the minimum values order for horses, which has to a large extent controlled the export of horses for slaughter for human consumption. However, as we are aware, that is a concession from the Community and could be bounced upon us in the European Court at any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
time. It is imperative for us to ensure that regulations are in place to provide adequate protection for horses not just for the present, but for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken up much of the Committee's time and have, perhaps, abused my role as an observer, but the all-party group agrees that this as a serious matter. We appreciate what my hon Friend is trying to do and urge him, although he has no need of that, to secure, with the support of Denmark, Holland and Germany and any other friendly nations within the Council of Ministers, progress on a maximum journey time and on the enforcement of regulations that are patently being flouted throughout the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.49 am.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward O'Hara (Rnowsley, South)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep my comments brief because I sense that I irritated the Minister when I pressed him on journey times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept fully his honourable assurance that he is trying to achieve an honourable compromise, but an honourable compromise is as easy to define as the length of a piece of string. I trust that he will accept that I am honouring my duty to the welfare of animals when I press him to ensure that the compromise is on the best possible terms from our point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We stand firmly on the principle of journey times, which the hon. Member for Thanet, North (Mr. Gale) referred to at some length, as the way towards the end game as he put it, or the export of meat on the hook, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe put it. The principle has been conceded for poultry, so why can it. not be extended to red meat—to those animals that we have been discussing this morning?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are firm on the principle, which was also mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe, that these animals should be classified as sentient creatures, not simply as agricultural products. The hon. Member for Eltham made well the point that this is not a sentimental matter and that there are sound commercial reasons to advance our cause. The hon. Member for Thanet, North referred to other commercial reasons and I shall not burden the Committee by repeating them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We regard the directive as a step in the right direction but not far enough. There are strong commercial as well as moral reasons for advancing beyond the directive. Several members of the Committee and I have mentioned that a good platform of support for that advance exists in the European Union. We shall continue to press the Minister hard to build upon that platform and move towards the end game of limiting journey times and the export of meat on the hook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon McMaster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Thanet, North hit the nail on the head when he said that it was important to estabish now the principle of a maximum journey time so that we can determine in the future what that should be. The Minister has assured us that he is trying to achieve that and I accept the difficulty of being more frank this morning. However, we shall examine closely what he returns with from the meeting and he will be judged on his performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
If he is as effective in dealing with and attacking those people who advance a contrary argument as he was this morning in attacking the RSPCA, he may get somewhere. He is a talented debater. He has argued a strong case for animal welfare while attacking the people who support it, which places him in a fine position. If we want to achieve adequate animal welfare, a maximum journey time is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not criticise the RSPCA for launching an advertising campaign in Britain. Other people would have criticised it if it had spent money abroad. There is nothing wrong with raising public awareness and, if that means that members of the British public put pressure on the Government, that is well and good and exactly what should happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Scarborough criticised Brian Montgomery, a senior agriculture manager with the National Westminster bank. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was entirely fair. Whether or not one agrees with what Mr. Montgomery said he certainly put forward a logical case. I think that he was trying to say that, if we continue to send animals abroad for slaughter, there will come a day when all the slaughterhouses are closed. If we then win the argument to slaughter them in this country, the trade will have to go abroad because we shall have no slaughterhouses left in Britain. We have to be clever and sensible in dealing with that. I think that that was the point that Mr. Montgomery was attempting to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I asked the Minister a question and then had to leave the Committee Room for a few minutes. My question was about the design and construction of vehicles. What is the Government's opinion on that? In particular,what is the Government's opinion on the space requirements of animals being transported?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have already asked about enforcement. I do not want to belabour that point, except to say that there has been a problem in enforcing the regulations. The hon. Member for Thanet, North spoke about the inadequate levels of policing. What assurances can the Minister give that, whatever the outcome of negotiations, there will be a properly trained and properly resourced inspectorate to ensure that the regulations are properly enforced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he was working hard to produce high standards and that we must trust him to do his best in the negotiations that are taking place. I would trust him on many matters, but it is not for Members of Parliament to trust Ministers. It is the job of Members of Parliament to scrutinise what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 28th report of the Select Committee on European Legislation refers to the stance taken by the Government in the negotiations. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The approach of the Government to the present proposals will be 'to seek Community rules which provide welfare safeguards equivalent to those currently operated in the United Kingdom'."</p></blockquote>
I have already said that we should try to maintain those standards. It is not sufficient to say that it is a matter for negotiation, and we shall win some and lose some. The Government are supposed to be committed to maintaining British standards, which many of us think of as a minimum to be improved upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
That was not only an opinion expressed generally by the Government; it was the result of the Select Committee's meeting on 23 March 1991 when an amendment was made to the effect that, in their negotiations, the Government should act consistently with the measures currently in operation. That was subsequently endorsed by the House and tabled in the name of the Prime Minister. Therefore, we expect that to be a mandate, which Ministers will pursue. There should be some means by which we can keep an eye on whether that mandate is being fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from the documents that the directive will be decided by a qualified majority. Therefore, we shall need to know how we have voted. Furthermore, it has been suggested that various amendments—for instance, on journey times—could be pressed. Nothing in the reports of meetings of the Council of Ministers shows that amendments were proposed or lost on a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council of Ministers obviously does not reach its decisions as Parliament does, yet its meetings are supposed to be transparent and open. At the meetings of Heads of Government—in 1992 in Edinburgh and recently in Brussels—it was decided that we should know what took place at meetings of the Council of Ministers and that part of that process should be the recording of votes. In answer to my questions, the Prime Minister and Ministers responsible for European affairs have said that those matters will be reported to us and that we should also be told when a matter is passed without a vote. Not many Departments live up to that promise, although the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is probably the best. It is imperative that a report is given about this directive— preferably on the Floor of the House, where there can be questions—which contains details of our position. Even if the decisions are taken by qualified majority voting, and even if there are problems with Spain and Greece, it should be possible to maintain or even extend our standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief. I agree with most of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North East (Mr. Barnes). We share a dubiety about the Minister asking us again and again to put our trust in what appear to be secret negotiations. I worry that the partnership that is struck will hide some of the Government's agenda. We shall be told that the deal was forced on them by their partners to get a majority in the Council of Ministers. That was shown in the Minister's speech, when he bowed to the farm lobby. He knows that there are votes to be had and, despite other assurances, that will be a consideration. If that is how the matter is approached, the welfare of animals may not be paramount in the discussions in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North East are worried that the proceedings of the Council of Ministers are not properly or adequately reported. We and those who press us about the welfare of animals cannot judge whether the Government have put the matter high enough on the agenda, and whether it has been placed before commercial interests; such as those pushed by the hon. Member for Scarborough. The latter are important, but they should not necessarily overrule the way in which we look after the animals in our care—particularly farm and domestic animals. I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government's position will be made public, and that we shall not simply be told that it was better than that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
of other member states. We should know what the Government put on the table at the Council of Ministers—what hours of travel or distance—and what they say on our behalf, and we could then judge them better. If I had some reassurance on that, I should be willing not so much to trust the Minister, but at least to wait and see what he puts before the Council of Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee for such a good debate, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North made an excellent contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with the serious points raised by the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe. They were in marked contrast to the triviality of the point made by the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), who tried to deal with the matter in a political way. He gave the game away by saying that there are votes in it, which shows the paucity and essentially trivial nature of his contribution to the debate. He should understand that for us this is not a political matter. We are interested in securing the best possible animal welfare deal that we can. We acknowledge that it will not be perfect and will be a compromise because of the nature of the beast. There is no point in wishing that away. The hon. Gentleman represents Falkirk, which, in its day, was the greatest centre in Britain—certainly in Scotland—for the transport of sheep south. He struck the only false note in the entire debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe and other members of the Committee raised the issue of sheep. Sheep are once more a subject of the negotiations. The British Government were entirely responsible for making them centre stage. The hon. Gentlemen is right that such is the size of the sheep trade from this country that it would have been quite improper for negotiations on animal welfare to have taken place without considering sheep. I endorse and applaud what the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be impertinent to the hon. Gentleman, but he shows a remarkable naivety when he says, "We are against this, that or the other," but then says, "I am not prepared to discuss our policy or what we would do."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that I was not prepared to discuss detailed policy, but our policy is actively to campaign for and support an eight-hour limit. The Labour party is clear about that and is puzzled as to why the Government will not campaign for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with that. He talked earlier of the changes that he would make to the Treaty of Rome in negotiation with the European Community in the unlikely event of his achieving high office. All of us look forward to finding out how the hon. Gentleman fares with that. The campaign strategy, red roses and all the attendant nonsense that has accompanied the Labour party's most recent four election defeats, will not help him. He will have to come up with some sensible, serious, meaningful and practical ideas. What he said this morning meant nothing. I shall not discuss journey times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the hon. Gentleman's point about the RSPCA. I have many friends in the RSPCA. I have regular and intimate contact with the RSCPA. It is an organisation for which I have, in some respects the highest regard and admiration. The chief veterinary officer of the RSPCA, Alistair Mews, is a friend of mine and I like its director-general, Peter Davies, very much. I have a lot of dealings
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
with them and generally support their ideas. But it is a mistake to pretend that the RSPCA is the only animal charity in the country or that it has a monopoly of wisdom. There are times when such an organisation, which is ridden with faction and dissent, inevitably makes profound mistakes. One such mistake was its advertising in the United Kingdom. The point that needs repeatedly to be made is that it is not here that the trouble lies; it is in France, Spain, Italy and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked if lactating cows were being considered in the negotiations. Yes, they are. He asked about the state of the negotiations. They are highly fluid. At least three position papers have been issued from the chief veterinary officers' negotiations during the past 48 hours. I should be misleading the Committee if I were to state the exact present position, because it has probably changed dramatically once more. The hon. Gentleman made an important point about vehicle standards, an issue which the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. McMaster) also raised. We have national rules for the time being. Further Community standards will be announced at some stage, but not necessarily during current negotiations. It is important to achieve high standards not just in Britain, but throughout the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe made a fair and important point about Spanish slaughterhouses. If the hon. Gentleman had been in our position, he would have been forced to do what we, reluctantly, did. There would have been—and there was to be—an imminent challenge under the single market legislation, and we could not have sustained our case in any court. We made a great deal of effort via agreements between the chief vets in this country and in Spain—the Spaniards were thoroughly cooperative—to ensure that our animals went to fully licensed, properly run, properly supervised, European Union—controlled slaughterhouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Photographs were taken of the disgraceful treatment of animals in some Spanish abattoirs. Such abattoirs had none of the features I mentioned. I was clear that there was no veterinary supervision and that there was the most grotesque inhumanity. None of the animals was British—not that that makes any difference. They were poor, wretched, little Spanish goats and sheep who had screwdrivers stuck into the backs of their throats. That is a disgraceful and wholly unacceptable state of affairs. The problem does not exist in this country, but in countries that have cultural attitudes that are beyond our comprehension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe said that he was glad that we had accepted the argument on subsidiarity. He was either being less than chivalrous or charitable, or he did not know what had happened. At Edinburgh, the British Government insisted from day one that policy on animals was not a suitable matter for subsidiarity, and that it was a pan-European problem which must be dealt with as such, not just for commercial reasons, but for welfare reasons. The hon. Gentleman was churlish in his acceptance of the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North. My Ministry has the highest regard for my hon. Friend's work. We are extremely grateful to the all-party group for is work and advice, and for the fact that it regularly works with us and keeps us in touch with its views. It is an admirable institution, which is informed and authoritative. Anyone
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
who heard my hon. Friend speak will know that he has deep conviction and great knowledge on these matters. I cannot deal with all my hon. Friend's points because there were so many. In any event, he knows the answers perfectly well. I shall therefore deal with the most important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to say that journey times are important, although he must realise that they form part of the negotiations and that they are not of sole importance. He referred to meat going out on the hook or on the hoof. If we achieve the accommodation that he seeks, there may well be an effect one way or the other. The Government wholly accept that journey times are an important part of the calculation and we shall take full account of his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work of Intergroup is admirable. It is doing, in a practical way, what the RSPCA should be doing. It is trying to change the climate of opinion among legislators in European countries where animal welfare is an emerging concept. It has our support. We do not agree with it all the time, but we believe that what it is trying to do is not only sensible, but terribly important for the continuing welfare of animals. The question of sheep is back in negotiations, as my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough would expect. He comes from one of the biggest and most important upland farming areas in the country, where the trade in sheep is extremely important. I know that those involved do not wish to damage the sheep trade. He referred to notes by Penny Lewis and I should be grateful if he would let me have them. We saw the article and are making inquiries about Sisteron. The figures are gigantic and we wonder whether proper animal welfare measures are being adhered to in that plant. We shall see what more we can do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is completely right when he talks about enforcement because it is the key to the public's agreement and acceptance of any package. It is the key to a general understanding across Europe of the need not just to bang on and parrot on about increased animal welfare standards, but to ensure that those standards and the general keeping of animals improves. My hon. Friend is right to highlight the ineffectiveness of the Commission's inspectorate. There are only 12 inspectors. The Commission wails and wrings its hands because it has no money for any more inspectors. But, such a tiny inspectorate is almost meaningless and we depend on the national rules being right and the veterinary services and relevant authorities in each country taking the trouble to do what they should under the rules and regulations, which are to enforce animal welfare standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister take the opportunity to deal with my earlier point about having a licensing regime for animal transporters? That would fit in with his point about enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am attracted by that idea. I had not thought of it before. We shall consider it and perhaps ask the hon. Gentleman to have a talk about it. It could be a good idea, but I do not know whether it would be workable. Perhaps the time to discuss it is when we deal with the various changes regarding trucks and lorries. It is an interesting idea, and I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not referring to it sooner. No discourtesy was intended. I probably could not read my own handwriting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North made a formidable speech and referred to minimum values, a matter that is most dear to my heart and interests. The issue
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
is not up for grabs, and we shall not countenance a change. It is important always to make the point, but as my hon. Friend knows, in animal welfare, there are moments when events are on the tide; when they are current and need to be dealt with. As the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East said, it is not the job of Members of Parliament to be nice to Ministers; hon. Members need to drag information from them and push them in certain directions. The issue of minimum values is settled at present and I see no reason why it should be overturned. If the European Community felt that it was right to even mention it, it would be making a stupefying, political mistake as well as an immoral one, which the British people would not tolerate. I believe that minimum values are safe as they stand at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara), who has left the Committee. He was perfectly entitled to press me and I apologise if I appeared to be irritated, but I was unable to express any more clearly what I was trying to say. We shall do the best we can. The Committee is fully aware of what we want to achieve, but the difference between wanting to do something and being able to get there in matters relating to animal welfare in the European Community is an area twixt cup and lip. We are involved in difficult, fast moving, extremely fluid negotiations, but we have tried to make clear what we want to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Government support the German proposal, which accepts the principle of maximum journey time, but which does not put a limit on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Gentleman too often falls into the trap of believing that everything is written in tablets of stone. I have no idea what the state of play will be when I leave the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the principle. The principle is clear. We must achieve an overall package that will stick and that can be enforced. It is a matter not of eight, 10 or 15 hours, but of what the whole package will look like. Grateful as we are for the guidance of Opposition Members, Ministers are capable of recognising a friend in the Community when they see one. It is plain that, on this matter, Germany is on the side of the angels, and we are grateful for its support.

The hon. Member for Paisley, South always takes a sensible and robust line on these matters, and I am grateful for his understanding. I do not propose to say anything further about the RSPCA, although I, like him, mainly support what it does. I regret that I find myself in such profound disagreement with him on this matter. The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of vehicle standards, with which I have already dealt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McMaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's answer. Even if it were agreed today that vehicle standards must be improved, the design, construction and phasing in of such vehicles would take 20 years. If we do not start soon to improve the quality of vehicles, it will be 30 or 40 years before any substantial difference is achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the hon. Gentleman's pessimism on the time scale. I agree that the matter needs clarifying, but I point out that it is not part of the regulations under discussion. The hon. Gentleman is right about the hare that he is pursuing. The matter must be dealt with, and I do not resile from that. I am sorry that he is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
disappointed with my answer, but that is the situation. The hon. Gentleman made a good and sensible point about enforcement, over which there is not a hair's breadth between us. It is the key to the entire operation, if we are to improve the welfare of animals in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East about pursuing Ministers. I cannot present any more specifically than I have already done the Government's position in the negotiations. All the subjects that have been mentioned today—journey times, feeding and watering, loading and unloading—are part of the huge jigsaw that we are trying to put together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept and understand the hon. Gentleman's queries about the way in which voting takes place in the Council of Ministers, even on a qualified majority basis, but I am not in a position to answer them. As I said earlier, that is properly a matter that he should raise with my right hon. Friend the Lord President of the Council, as I am sure he will. I cannot state more clearly that our position is in favour of animals, proper welfare standards and enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have persistently raised the matter and will continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is an extremely persistent and vigorous attender in the House of Commons, and he chivvies and harries Ministers. That is what they are there for. He should address his remarks to my right hon. Friend the Lord President.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is inviting us to press and harry Ministers, may I press him one last time on the principle of a maximum journey time, around which he has been ducking and weaving. I understand that he is speaking of a package of measures, but the heart of such a package on animal welfare should be maximum journey time. Will he support that principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have resisted reading from my brief, but I shall read just one sentence which, Sir James, I know you will insist on being the last words from me on the RSPCA and journey times, I shall read the relevant sentence to the hon. Gentleman, who has rightly pushed me on the matter. I understand why and I hope that he will accept that I cannot go further than the following sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is taking full account of the case for journey limits and their enforcement when negotiating the controls which should apply to long journeys."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman will say that those are weasel words, drafted by Ministers who are ducking and weaving, seeking to evade their responsibilities while never facing up to reality. He will claim that they are the words of poor, wretched Ministers, forced to negotiate for many hours with officials in smoke-filled rooms through the night, seeking always to come to a proper accommodation but having to compromise and return home to be berated by the hon. Gentleman and told how much better he would have acted. However, those are the words and that is where we stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East took offence at what I said to him and I am sorry if he is so over sensitive about the matter. Our position has been made consistently plain throughout the discussions and the hon. Gentleman cannot have it all ways. He is in favour of the National Farmers Union and against this and that. We are all concerned with one matter only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if it seems that I have been upset by anything that the Minister said. Probably, it has more to do with the fact that I am toiling under the effects of a terrible cold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must correct the record because it is important that Ministers are not seen to be so far wrong in print without correction that they do not even know the geography of Scotland. The Tryst, the famous market to which the Minister referred, lies in the constituency of Clackmannan and it was never in the town of Falkirk. Certainly, it is not in my industrial constituency where there are few farmers, so I do not speak to gain any local advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem right to the Minister to say that his is a terrible job because he cannot be accurate in what he says in the Committee as he must be flexible when he attends the Council of Ministers. Those outside the House who read the report of the debate will ask why the Minister did not state the journey time that marks the start of his negotiating position. We would be far more confident if, when the Minister went into the negotiations, we knew the starting point of the British Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the Minister will be berated for what he brings back by those who wish to gain advantage and others who genuinely feel that he has not won enough. If we knew the point from which the Minister intended to start, we would have far more confidence in the process that he described to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not call the hon. Gentleman's sincerity into doubt in the case for animal welfare that he is pushing. However, in asking about the point from which we would start, the hon. Gentleman reminds me of the story of the decision to erect a statue of Harold Wilson in the Members' Lobby. When asked why it had been done, someone said, "When he set out, he didn't know where he was going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
When he got there he didn't know where he was, when he came back he didn't know where he had been and he did it all on borrowed money." I am in a similar position because we are going round and round the track, trying to come up with a sensible, enforceable, pragmatic deal which, above all, will secure the welfare of animals travelling across Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Gentleman is pressing me, but he must understand that I have said time and again that journey limits are an important consideration in the negotiations but they are not the sole consideration. Of course, they are part of the negotiations because they are in the memorandum and the document. We shall deal with whomsoever we must to get the deal that we want and to try to benefit the animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must warn the Committee, as I have done so frankly throughout our proceedings, that it will not be a perfect deal but one on which we shall have had to compromise. That is the case for all such deals, but we shall have done the best that we possibly can and I hope that, reflected in the negotiations, will be the instinctive and real desire of the British people to have the welfare of animals properly protected right across Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 8441/93, relating to the protection of animals during transport, and supports the Government's intention of seeking to negotiate high standards of care throughout the Community for animals during transport.</p></blockquote></p>
