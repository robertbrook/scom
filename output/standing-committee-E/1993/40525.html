Intra-Community trade in Bovine Animals and Swine</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Nicholas Soames)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Dr. Blackburn, may I say what an honour it is to sit at your feet? I have not had the pleasure of being a member of a Committee chaired by you before, but I am sure that it will be conducted with despatch and good order. I look forward to your guidance. It is retrograde step, however, that we have paper cups in the Committee Room; I hope that we shall soon return to glasses.<br><br>
Thank you, Dr. Blackburn, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about this important issue. I must stress that the motion should refer to protecting the health status of the United Kingdom, not just Great Britain. Before commenting on the proposal, I wish to explain briefly the background to Council directive 64/432/EEC, which governs intra-Community trade in cattle and pigs and say why it is necessary to amend it.<br><br>
The directive lays down detailed animal health rules, including a requirement that cattle exported for breeding or production originate from herds that are free from tuberculosis, brucellosis and enzootic bovine leukosis and that pigs for breeding come from brucellosis-free herds. In addition, the testing of cattle for tuberculosis and brucella, and pigs for brucella, is required if the animals are more than a certain age and are exported for breeding or production.<br><br>
Testing for EBL is required for cattle more than 12 months old that are not intended for meat production, and which originate from a member state or region that is not free from the disease. Trade in calves that are less than 15 days old is not currently subject to directive 64/432, but is subject to rules agreed bilaterally between trading countries. All consignments of cattle and pigs must be accompanied by official health certification signed by a veterinarian with a competent authority in the member state of origin.<br><br>
European document 4168/94 is a proposal for a Council directive to amend and update the earlier directive. Consolidation of that 30-year-old directive and the 40 or so amendments made over the years is long overdue, and we generally welcome it. The Commission considers it appropriate to propose several new amendments to the directive that are in keeping with the single market philosophy of liberalising trade. Unfortunately, in undertaking the amendment exercise, the Commission failed to provide a summary of the numerous consequential amendments, to other directives. As the Committee has rightly pointed out, the absence of such a summary does not facilitate transparency and ease of use.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
Directive 64/432 is an animal health directive; it does not deal with animal welfare. That is, of course, covered by other Community rules. We have fully implemented Community welfare legislation, supplemented by our national rules, which are extremely strict. I assure the Committee that we shall continue to press the Community to adopt additional rules that reflect our high standards of care.<br><br>
As for the proposed amendments, the Government support the principle of removing unnecessary barriers to trade and support the initiative taken by the Commission in drafting the proposal with a view to facilitating trade. However, what may be good for United Kingdom exporters may not necessarily be good for importers and the industry generally. It is, therefore, important that the individual provisions are assessed carefully to ensure that they do not increase the risk of disease being spread between member states.<br><br>
We also know that, understandably, the industry wishes to proceed with caution and avoid the risks of the spread of disease into the United Kingdom. The proposal to reduce from six months to 30 days the period of residency in the exporting member state is of major concern to the industry. Although it is not completely opposed to reducing the minimum residency period, it considers that 30 days is too short a time. Similarly, the proposal to remove altogether the pre-movement testing of animals being moved from regions officially recognised as disease-free may be premature while pockets of disease continue to occur within the Community and in certain third countries.<br><br>
Those two proposals would certainly benefit the United Kingdom's export trade, particularly by eliminating pre-movement testing for brucellosis. It is essential, however to measure those benefits against the possible risk to this country's high animal health status, to which we all attach much importance.<br><br>
The proposal that has met the greatest reaction from industry is the intention to bring trade in calves less than 15 days old within the scope of the directive. About 450,000 calves were exported last year, mainly to the Netherlands, France and Belgium. It is extremely important business. Among other things, the calves must come from the herds where there has been no outbreak of EBL during the past two years. Under the proposal, however, calves for export would have to come from herds situated in an EBL-free member state or region or from herds that were individually EBL-attested. To gain attested status, herds would need to be EBL tested with negative results twice in 12 months. That could be achieved by herds joining the Government's excellent cattle health scheme or by a comparable private arrangement.<br><br>
As great Britain is unlikely in the short term to be recognised by the Commission as being EBL-free, all 30,000 dairy herds and a few beef herds producing calves for export would therefore have to undergo routine testing for EBL. It would also be necessary to keep activities on farms and at markets involving export status calves separate from activities involving non-export status calves. That would initially involve some capital outlay, particularly by market operators, to provide the necessary facilities. Where tasks had to be carried out twice as a result, staff costs would be doubled. In addition to the extra resources required to deal with a large number of applications for EBL testing under the cattle health scheme, the state veterinary service would be required to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
approve markets handling calves. There would also be a need for official verification of the status of calves at those markets.<br><br>
Finally, the Government and industry are concerned that the proposed list of diseases for which additional trade guarantees may be requested does not include warble fly. The United Kingdom has already submitted a case for such guarantees in the absence of appropriate harmonised control measures to maintain the country's warble-free status. Our argument that additional trade guarantees for warble fly are necessary if our health status is to be sufficently protected has been strengthened by the recent imports of French cattle found to be infected with the parasite. As an interim measure, we have been able to deal with the problem under national rules. As permitted under EC rules, cattle that have been found to be clinically infested on import have been returned to France.<br><br>
The proposal that we are debating raises several important issues and the Government welcome the opportunity to hear the Committee's views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The courtesy extended to me by the Minister is deeply valued.</span></p>
<p>10.37 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify his statement about consignments of cattle and pigs being accompanied by official health certification? I listened carefully to what the Minister said and I wish the matter to be made absolutely clear for the record.<br><br>
Does the Minister believe that the directive is premature? He will be aware of the Select Committee investigation into animal infection and the movement of animals across European borders. He will know of the increase in outbreaks of the disease in the United Kingdom since the introduction of the single market. The directive should be carefully considered with that in mind before it is implemented.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those two questions. First, the proposal would require all animals entering intra-Community trade to be subjected to a health examination and an indentity check by an official veterinarian before movement and to be accompanied during transportation by a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent veterinary authority of the member state of origin and conforming to the model laid down in the directive. The answer is an unequivocal yes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's second question was most important. There is no politics involved: We all agree that the maintenance of the country's high animal health status is critical. From my contact with livestock farmers—I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has found the same—I know that what most concerns them, after reform of the common agricultural policy, is importation of disease.<br><br>
As to future developments, we shall never be able to say that there is a right moment, but we welcome the consolidation of the other proposals in a new directive. We shall study carefully the Select Committee's report, but we need to get a move on. We agree with it about matters designed to enhance the high animal health status in this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
country. The Select Committee is still at a working group stage, but we shall continue to negotiate for our position and for the best interests of our farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his remarks about warble fly, which is a matter of great concern to farmers, not least in Cornwall and the west country.<br><br>
The other main concern, which the Minister mentioned, is EBL. Will he explain exactly why the Commission is unlikely to agree that the United Kingdom be recognised as EBL free? The industry has pressed the Government to press the Commission on that matter, as was made clear in the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation. Declaring the United Kingdom an EBL free zone would be by far the best way to do away with all the expense involved in designating individual herds EBL free.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend is in close touch with farmers in Cornwall and the west country, I applaud his concern about warble fly, which I know to be the source of a great worry.<br><br>
At the moment, the extent of EBL in the United Kingdom is being surveyed prior to a full testing programme. A member state is deemed to be EBL free either if 99·8 per cent, of national herds are EBL tested or if other specific criteria are met, including that of a period of three years having passed since the last case of EBL infection was confirmed. As yet, we cannot meet either condition. Only 4,000 herds—4 per cent.—are EBL tested, and there have been seven cases of infection to date in 1994.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain the precise difference between the definition of region and country in the directive? I do not seek to make an obscure legal point, but as importation of animals can take place from an EBL free region it is important that we understand how a region is defined. As the Minister knows, there have been too many cases in which animals have been exported and have subsequently been found to be diseased.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As to the question of region and country, Northern Ireland, for example, is a region, which is EBL free, whereas Great Britain is a country, which is not EBL free.<br><br>
As to the importation of animals that are diseased, I assume that the hon. Lady refers to warble fly cases. We have been absolutely firm about that matter, in a way that the hon. Lady would applaud. I want publicly to congratulate the state veterinary service on the work that it has done to check the animals, which is a big and demanding obligation. Whenever we have found cattle that have been imported with warble fly, they have been re-exported immediately.<br><br>
I instructed the Chief Veterinary Officer to tell his French counterpart, that such importation is entirely unacceptable. We have had a positive response, and I have every reason to believe that we shall resolve the matter, although not immediately—indeed, we had to send some cattle back the other day. The problem has been acknowledged; our position is quite plain and the French will do something about the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Lady no doubt intends to ask about certification, which is, of course, key. Unless we can have confidence and trust in the certification of other countries, there will always be a feeling in this country that certification there is not quite as good as it is here. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
assured that there is no reason to believe that standards of veterinary inspection are less high in other countries. Where we have had worries about certification we have made them known in a vigorous manner not only to the country concerned but to the Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister therefore able to assure us that, if necessary, veterinary officers from this country will have the right to monitor the process of issuing certification? He will forgive me if those of us who have served in the European Parliament and spend much time reading fraud reports emanating from various countries have severe reservations about the accuracy and continuing control of certification procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, there is no evidence of lower standards. I entirely acknowledge the hon. Lady's concern. Anybody who talks to farmers as often as she does will be aware that British farmers do not believe foreign veterinarians—we all know that to be the case. We must deal on a Government-to-Government basis and we have no reason to believe that official veterinary services of other member states are any less competent than those of the United Kingdom. Occasional errors in veterinary certification have occured, but they have always been immediately and vigourously been taken up. I give the hon. Lady a cast-iron assurance that we watch the situation like a hawk. I understand and accept her reservations, which, to an extent, we share. We are keeping a beady eye on the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the British Government's attitude to the decision not to test dairy cows for mastitis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I give the Lady a detailed reply by letter? I am so deaf that I could not hear what my official was telling me. Testing is not satisfactory, but I will give the hon. Lady a detailed reply later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister a series of questions to which he might like to give me the answers later? Since imported animals will have to come from a holding in which there has been no trace of EBL for two years and in which testing has been extensively carried out, or from an EBL-free member state, does the Minister accept that the provision will be slightly more stringent than it is at present and will probably produce some positive results from our point of view? Does he further accept that, for that reason the situation must be monitored extremely carefully, because the measure will have a direct economic effect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that if we were to move to the proposed EBL regime, costs would be increased. I shall have to give the hon. Lady a detailed reply to the other part of her question by letter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the cost of the measure in the short term to dairy farmers exporting is likely to be in the region of £11.5 million?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have given the Committee the compliance cost assessment of the measure. As the proposal is drafted, 26,000 herds from which cows are currently exported that are not EBL-tested would have to be EBL-tested if the market is to be sustained. The additional cost of EBL testing to the dairy farming industry would be about £11.5 million.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the proposals would remove existing safeguards on animals imported into the United Kingdom from other member states?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. As I said in my opening speech, there are areas about which we have considerable concern. As the hon. Lady knows, it is a matter of balancing the difficulties with imports in intra-community trade and the opportunities for our exporters. That is why the subject of the negotiation is important to us. We wish to balance the advantages against the disadvantages and not allow our high animal health status to be compromised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's view of the decision to accept qualified majority voting on the directive? It will mean that unless Britain builds a careful alliance it will be easily outvoted on important animal health matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady knows—she is much more experienced than any of us here—Parliamentary Secretaries do not have views on qualified majority voting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow up the relevant question about cost asked by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). The Minister said that the cost of extending EBL testing to herds would be approximately £11.5 million, spread between 26,000 herds. Does he consider that a reasonable burden for herd owners to be saddled with? Is there a way in which savings could be made without reducing the effectiveness of the test? Hon. Members who represent agricultural areas are conscious of constantly piling more and more costs on to farmers. Is there any way in which that cost could be reduced? Does he consider it to be a reasonable cost?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that cost is clearly a factor. Under the cattle health scheme, EBL attestation takes a minimum of four months. The initial cost includes a fee of £165 for joining the health scheme and the sampling cost of an estimated £3.10 per head. For a herd of 80 cows—the current health scheme average herd size—the testing costs will be about £250, giving a total cost for an average herd of about £415. The figures take into account the fact that the Government's EBL national monitoring programme meets the cost of the first of two qualifying tests required to becomes EBL attested.<br><br>
As for dairy herds, milking more than 60 cows at any one time, the national attesting programme is not fully adequate for that purpose. Large dairy herds require a small extra cost of about £10 for 60 cows in milk. If the costs of the first test have to be met by the industry and not the Government, the cost of a beef herd becoming attested would be increased by £3.10 a head, a further £250 for an average herd. That gives a total cost of about £665. the extra costs will be much less for dairy herds, as the extra tests could be carried out on bulk milk supplies at a cost of about £10 for 60 cows in milk. That is an extra £20 for an average here, giving a total cost of about £435.<br><br>
Once a herd has become attested, an annual renewal fee of £89 for scheme membership must be paid. The herd must be tested at intervals not exceeding three years. At present, the cost of the testing is met by the national testing programme. However, large dairy herds face a milk testing cost of £10 for 60 cows. In terms of the annual cost, the cost of the extra milk test for large dairy herds is insignificant.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I do not disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) about the costs of maintaining the costs of the health scheme. However, animal health cannot be bought for nothing, the money is well spent. We are extremely conscious of the fact that we need to keep costs as low as possible. There is little incentive for farmers to become EBL free while there is a ban on the export of breeding cattle due to BSE. We have to maintain a balance in such matters. I assure my hon. Friend that when we ask farmers to pay for such schemes or when we have to run schemes ourselves, we are deeply conscious of the money we spend. There are also strict Treasury rules to ensure that that is the case. I acknowledge that farmers have to face an expense.</span></p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 4168/94, and the Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 6th May, relating to intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine; and supports the Government's objective of ensuring that the rules protect the health status of the United Kingdom, and the Community as a whole, and sustain the United Kingdom's existing export market.—<i>[Mr. Soames.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody <span class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important directive. The calm and measured delivery of the Minister, for whom we have a real affection, may have misled him into thinking that it is not controversial. The measure is extremely controversial. It is likely to cost a considerable amount of money and it is a double-edged sword, like so much Community legislation. Although it will improve some aspects of animal health by making the application of the rules more strict, it excludes the problem of warble fly. That should concern us because there was evidence in my constituency of cattle coming from outside the Community via another Community country. It is clear that people dealing with Germany will be worried about the level of veterinary care and protection.<br><br>
The Select Committee on European Legislation asked a number of pertinent questions. Although the Minister said with great aplomb that Parliamentary Secretaries never have opinions on matters such as majority voting, he will know that that is precisely that type of machinery that determines whether directives have the agreement of member states. If a directive on animal health can be pushed through on a qualified majority vote, many of us in the British Parliament will have severe reservations about its effect.<br><br>
Although we have developed high levels of protection for our animals, unfortunately that is not true of all member states. I am not suggesting in a little Englander way that somehow vets in other countries are less able or have had worse training, but because of a major difference in animal health, animals that are diseased will be imported.<br><br>
As an island, we have always been able to isolate disease because fairly ruthless measures have been taken. Frequently, at great cost to the farming community, we have been able to maintain high standards. Many continental countries rely heavily on vaccines and other levels of care that are not necessarily of the same high standard. It is extremely important to understand what we mean by brucellosis-free. We are talking not only about animal health but the animal's position in the food chain.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Doctors in rural practices still find cases of brucellosis, which is a very disabling disease that can continue for a long time because it is recurrent. It can have specific effects on farmers and their families, so it should not be treated lightly. Although we shall be regarded as brucellosis-free initially, there will be continuing problems if the proposals go ahead in their present form. The proposals will remove some safeguards for animals imported into the United Kingdom from other member states, especially those that are officially free of diseases. An outbreak of brucellosis in Wales recently cost £0.4 million.<br><br>
In answers to me and other hon. Members, the Minister has made it clear that warble fly is a good example of a problem that is becoming more prevalent, although it is not covered by the directive. It was virtually non-existent when we controlled our own animals. In 1993, however, the number of clinical cases shot up to 207 from none the year before, and the number of seropositive cases rose to 298 from four the previous year. Those figures were given in a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) on 6 May 1994. Although the Minister stated that
<br><blockquote><p>"all the cases were found in cattle imported from France, apart from one clinical case imported from Belgium"—<i>[Official Report,</i> 6 May 1994; Vol. 242, <i>c.697.],</i></p></blockquote>
it is clear that there are continuing difficulties.<br><br>
I have reservations about the entire measure. It is logical to consolidate existing legislation in one directive; nobody would argue with that, and it could be regarded as a positive move. However, if by so doing, we water down some provisions, even if we make others more stringent, we have a right to ask the Government a number of pertinent questions.<br><br>
The Minister has glossed over the cost to British farmers, which I think will be considerable, and they will not be happy about it. I know that the Department received a great deal of information from people who were concerned about various aspects. The 30-days minimum residency period in a member state prior to export is a diminution of existing rules and could prove extremely dangerous. Aspects of the EBL treatment are putting some of our herds at risk.<br><br>
If the Ministry is to ask the House of Commons to accept that the directive represents an improvement rather than a deterioration in our monitoring processes, it will have to convince us that cattle cannot be imported through member states from outside the Community without proper checks and then passed on to other countries such as ours. In addition the Ministry must make it clear to the farming community that it is prepared to consider ways of finding extra cash to support the introduction of some of the measures. The costs will be substantial for individual markets, and farmers will face extra expense in the movement of their herds. The Minister knows that some of the prices now being paid for herds are not such as to delight the farmers involved and convince them that farming is a paying trade. If, on the 450,000 calves exported annually from the United Kingdom at a cost of £70 million to £100 million, there is to be an extra levy, that will not contribute to the monetary advantage of those concerned.<br><br>
The Ministry has largely complied with the requirements of the European Community, but the wording of the directive is not sufficiently clear. I am concerned about the legal interpretation of the terms "region" and "country". Countries that are officially organised on the basis of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
regions could escape some of the implications for the United Kingdom, which would be regarded as a united unit. Unless such matters are resolved, we could find ourselves in an extremely dangerous situation.<br><br>
Animal health in the United Kingdom has advanced enormously in the past 40 years. The level of care devoted to herds is way ahead of what it was, even in my childhood. The introduction of high standards of medicine and zoological controls has benefited the consumer at every level. It always amuses me to hear modern consumers talk about organic produce. I lived on a farm where we all drank untreated milk and suffered considerably for it. I spent much of my early life in a TB ward, which was not unconnected with prevailing levels of animal health. Some of my colleagues on both sides of the House are occasionally carried away by fashionable ideas that are not necessarily in the interests of their constituents. That is why I am deeply concerned about the wording of the directive.<br><br>
The Minister is a lovely fellow and I trust him with most things, but I do not trust the Council of Ministers and I shall continue to watch this matter extremely closely.</span></p>
<p>11.4 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was right to say that there was not a great deal of difference between us on the need to campaign strongly to maintain this country as a healthy zone. We in the Labour party are proud of the quality of our herds and the disease-free status of our country, as my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich pointed out. My only slight dissent is that although Labour Members are proud of the quality of husbandry in this country, I am not proud of the fact that much of the calf trade that is dealt with by the directive is destined for veal crates on the continent.<br><br>
I recognise that there is a financial burden in extending the scope of the directive to calves of less than 15 days old and what that implies in costs for the trade in them. I wonder whether that might make producers in this country raise their aspirations for exports because I am concerned at their apparent low aspirations in relation to animals in the United Kingdom. Producers seem to be satisfied with large-scale exports of live animals such as sheep and calves and do not concentrate on the need to consider the value added trade. We should be competing with the continent in the carcase and meat products trade. The directive may make some producers turn their attention to those aspects if there is a cost differential between that and the carcase or value added trade. I hope that the low expectations which seem to be prevalent among British animal producers may make them think again about the matter. That would be no bad thing.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich made many of the points that I wished to raise, but I am worried that the disease-free status of this country is being undermind by the single market. That could have grave implications and there is evidence that it is happening. That is why the EC proposals should be considered very carefully. Rather than removing the restrictions, they should be made tighter and third-country imports should be taken into account. I have some suggestions on that issue that the Minister may wish to hear.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can give us a clear assurance that the directive is not designed to undermine regulations relating to health and welfare merely to facilitate free trade
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
in the Community. That would not benefit the producers or the consumers. Certainly, it would not benefit the status of animal production in the Community.<br><br>
What are the implications of the directive in relation to current arrangments for pigs for breeding and production? I hope that the Minister can say something about that and the reduction of the present obligatory minimum residency period which would facilitate the movement of animals. He said that he welcomed that, provided that the checks on imports from third countries are carried out correctly. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich.<br><br>
There are examples of animals being imported into the Community and this country illegally with the use of forged documents and evidence of poor investigation and veterinary checks at the time of their importation. At future meetings of the Council of Ministers, will the Minister consider discussing whether a Community team could be established that would carry out spot checks in member states to ensure that each is correctly discharging its responsibilities? That would not undermine the sovereignty of individual states, but would ensure that each member state was complying with the same regulations. It is doubtful whether some member states are applying the same rigorous standards for such checks as Britain's veterinary service or those of other member states. An independent and multinational inspectorate to ensure that standards are maintained could improve matters. Independent spot checks may have relevance to other aspects of Community law. The Minister clearly stated the costs of the changes and their consequences for producers. Considerable costs lead to pressure for fraud. Scope for saving large sums of money can be an inducement to forge documents and avoid the regulations. Therefore, spot checks are all the more important, especially when applied to third countries.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Minister will take up the issue of authorisation for additional trade guarantees to cover all the relevant diseases in member states. I am surprised that warble fly has not been covered. My hon. Friend read out some of the answers that I have received to written questions. It is remarkable that almost no cases occurred between 1988 and 1993, but a huge increase occurred in 1993 and there has been a significant number of cases in 1994. I welcome the Ministry's action in sending back the infected cows, which is that we have confidence in certification in other member states and our intention is to keep them up to the mark. I use those words to give the hon. Lady whatever assurance she will take from me. I accept that she remains sceptical—she is right to do so. The matter is of grave importance. The integrity of certification is critical and the ability to trust what is said essential.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Harris <span class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what my hon. Friend says. Nevertheless, will he have a word with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, about the training and standards of veterinaries in certain European countries, especially southern European countries? He might then be a little hesitant about stating that he has absolute faith in qualifications, let alone certification, in those countries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend tempts me down the rocky, broken stairway to indiscretion, which I have too often taken. This morning I shall remain tight-lipped. My hon. Friend is right—this year marks the 150th anniversary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. I had the honour of speaking at its meeting the other day, and it remains extremely anxious about the education of veterinaries and that the Commission should supervise and maintain standards. I assure him that that is a high priority for me and, much more importantly, for my right hon. Friend the Minister, who has done much to emphasise the urgency of ensuring that the Commission continues to monitor standards. That is important work.<br><br>
I do not want to be disrespectful or racist, but I am not sure that I would want my wife's excellent horse attended to in an emergency by a Greek veterinary, skilful though he might be. I should prefer a British veterinary, if one were available—I think we all would. Nevertheless, free trade is central. I accept what the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe says without reservation: the measure is not deregulatory; it is more regulatory than the present regime; it is a consolidation measure. I want the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich to hoist on board the fact that I accept and understand her scepticism about the matter. I hope that she understands what lies behind what I have said. As for qualified majority voting, all legislation covering animal health—not just this measure—is dealt with under article 43 of the treaty and therefore by qualified majority voting, as the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich knows.<br><br>
I have already said that increasing trade in live animals increases the risk of disease. However, trade in live animals between member states remains subject, as it has always been, to harmonised animal health rules. That returns us to certification. The hon. Lady asked about checks at borders for animals carrying disease that are to enter the United Kingdom. The primary responsibility for ensuring that disease does not spread from affected to non-affected areas of the Community rests—as it has always done—with the veterinary authorities of the country in which the disease outbreak has taken place.<br><br>
Harmonised EC rules place an obligation on member states to impose strict disease-control measures on holdings or in areas where a serious epizootic disease exists or is suspected to exist. The chief veterinary told me the other day that he was impressed by the way in which the Italians dealt with a foot and mouth disease outbreak last year. They were absolutely ruthless, they descended upon it like a ton of bricks and it was cleared up very quickly. We take the same view of the German outbreak of swine fever the other day. Such action is in the self-interest of the country concerned. That will not alter the hon. Lady's views, but it is wrong to assume that we always deal with these matters better than anyone else. That is not true.<br><br>
I hardly dare say it in front of highly qualified veterinarians, but we have had one or two cases in which certification has not been what it might be for animal welfare standards for cattle and sheep going abroad. We have had to take most stringent action to keep things up to the mark. There are always one or two bad apples.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked about the effects of this proposal on imports. It would make the importation of cattle and pigs simpler and cheaper but it would, as drafted, increase the risk of importing disease, as she rightly says. That is why I have come to the Committee to hear hon. Members views. I want to assure the hon. Lady that the Chief Veterinary Officer is attending a meeting of chief vets in Greece where these matters will be discussed. The matter is currently
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
before a working group. There is much water to flow under the bridge yet and we shall make sure that all the views that we have heard today are taken into account in our negotiating position.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe mentioned the outbreak of brucellosis. The only outbreak of brucellosis was imported, possibly from France. Animals imported have been tested before export. It is a feature of brucellosis that not all infected animals can be detected immediately by blood tests. That is one of the risks that we carry.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman aksed about the calf trade and veal crates. He knows very well that he and I are in complete agreement on this; rearing veal in calf crates is something that we do not like. We ban it in this country. It is forbidden. Other countries do not take the same view. Our job is to ensure, as we have tried to do on all these animal health and welfare matters, that the same high standards as we have hear are brought to other countries.<br><br>
It is important to put on record that the majority of our exports are in carcass meats, amounting to about £600 minion a year. It is an extremely important business for us. I acknowledge the importance of the integrity of certification and the hon. Gentleman's very good idea about inspections. In fact, inspections already take place. The Commission already has a team that inspects border posts and checks, but I shall let the hon. Gentleman have a note of the nature of those inspections so that he knows that they are already taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minster has kindly promised to reply on other issues, one of which is mastitis. Could he also touch upon the implications of reducing tests for mastitis if bovine somatotropin; which we have debated before in this Committee, were to be allowed within the Community, and the implications for animal welfare that that might have?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall let the hon. Gentleman have a detailed reply. A copy of my letter will be sent to the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich.<br><br>
I have listened carefully to the views that have been expressed in the Committee this morning. I want the hon. Lady and the Committee to know that our continuing objective during further negotiations will be to ensure that the rules will continue to protect the health status of the United Kingdom and the Community as a whole while sustaining our valuable and important export markets. The hon. Lady knows how important those are for our farmers.<br><br>
We must not fail to recognise that today we have been considering only one element in the prevention of the spread of animal diseases. In addition, all member states now operate a system of intensified veterinary checks on animals at the point of origin to ensure that only those complying with Community rules may enter intra-Community trade.<br><br>
As a further precaution, member states of destination may conduct spot checks on imported consignments at the point of destination or, where there is suspicion of irregularity, at any point in the transport chain, including points of entry.<br><br>
Whilst we believe that all the controls, when taken together and implemented conscientiously and correctly, as we do in this country, provide adequate safeguards against the spread of disease, we are not in any sense complacent. I give the hon. Lady my personal and categorical assurance of that. We cannot be complacent. The warble fly episode
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0476">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
shows clearly that are we not complacent, and that we are prepared to act with vigour. We have powers to take immediate safeguard action if we have reason to believe that there may be a risk in importing animals from certain areas. We will not hesitate to do so. However, in the light of concern about a number of recent animal health problems in which imported animals have been involved, my right hon. Friend the Minister announced at the end of last year newly strengthened measures to maintain Britain's high animal health status. They include the instigation of 24-hour periods of blanket surveillance at all south and east cost ports that cover exports as well as imports, the targeting of consignments with up to 100 per cent, checks when there is a risk from particular animal health disease and the stepping up of checks at the points of destination to between 50 and 60 per cent, on average. Such measures have been augmented as a result of our continuing assessment of disease risk and we shall continue with that approach.<br><br>
We have taken several steps to deal with particular disease risks. The frequency of blanket surveillance for 24-hour periods at south and east coast ports has been increased since February of this year. The level of post-import checks on imported poultry has been stepped up because of the threat of Newcastle disease. All pig imports are checked to keep out the threat not only Aujeszky's disease, but swine fever. That is of critical importance to our hard-pressed, nevertheless fundamentally successful pig industry.<br><br>
Following the 1993 warble fly outbreaks, all cattle that are imported from France are now checked and, without fail, clinically infested animals are returned to their country of origin. We have maintained our post-import quarantine requirements for captive birds imported from other member states.<br><br>
Only a small number of health problems have so far been found as a result of checks on animals imported in 1994; 41 cattle from 10 consignments imported from France were found to be clinically infested with warble fly and are being returned to France. Two stallions, imported from Russia and Sweden, were found to be seropositive for equine viral arteritis and were, in the immortal word of my hon. Friend the Member for Little Pig and Saddlecock—Littleborough and Saddleworth (Mr. Dickens)—"casterated".<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Responsibility for safeguarding our high animal health status does not, however, rest solely with the Government. In accepting the greater freedom that they have as traders under the single market, importers must assume responsibility for knowing what they are buying and under what conditions they should be buying. We have sent all livestock farmers a copy of our "Don't Import Disease" leaflet, which sets out their responsibilities with regard to the import of animals with great clarity. It is in farmers' interests to ensure that they follow those rules so that, together, we can continue to maintain the high animal health status that this country has for so long enjoyed, and with it the advantage that it gives to our exporters.<br><br>
I thank you, Dr. Blackburn, and the Committee for giving us the chance to discuss the matter. The hon. Members for Glanford and Scunthorpe, for Crewe and Nantwich and my hon. friend the Member for St. Ives reflected fairly, and with precision and clarity, the real anxieties of our farmers about the risk of the importation of disease. It is not just a matter of words; we all attach great importance to the issue. I want the Committee to know that we shall continue to do so and continue to put the entire resources at our disposal into ensuring that such a level of high animal health status is maintained.<br><br>
I acknowledge that we have difficulties ahead in the working group and in the Council, but we shall negotiate at all times in Britain's interests. I am confident that we shall reach a deal that will protect the country's high animal health status and of which the Committee will approve.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
