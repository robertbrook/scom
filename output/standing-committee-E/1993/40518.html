Milk Quotas (Italy)</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Michael Jack)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook, for calling me to put some points before the Committee by way of explanation on this matter. I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss with the Committee the Commission's proposals for the distribution of extra quota to Italy and to explain the Government's position.<br><br>
Our considerations centre on the Commission's additional report on the application of the Milk quota scheme in Italy and the associated explanatory memorandum this report was considered by the Agriculture Council in Luxembourg last month in the context of the Commission's 1994 common agricultural policy price-fixing proposals. It will be discussed further by the Agriculture Council later this month.<br><br>
The background to the report is the fact that until very recently none of the three countries has made a serious attempt to implement the milk quota system in accordance with Community Rules. In Spain and Italy that resulted in milk production significantly in excess of quota. Their response was to ask for an increase in their national quotas in exchange for a commitment to reduce production and implement the quota system properly. In the case of Greece, where actual production was not substantially over quota, the request for an increase in quota was based on the country's very low level of self-sufficiency in milk and reflected the difficulties Greece was having in importing milk from the former Yugoslavia.<br><br>
Provisional increases in quota were granted to Italy, Spain and Greece last year and the Commission was charged with the task of monitoring progress and reporting to the Council in March this year. That it has done. The report identified shortcomings in the implementation of the quota system in all three countries. The most serious of those were in respect of Italy, where it appeared that the overall target for reducing production would not be met. In view of that, the commission proposed that Italy's additional quota of 900,000 tonnes for 1993–94 should be reduced by 350,000 tonnes for 1994–95.<br><br>
Within a matter of weeks the Italians presented revised milk production statistics to the Commission. On the basis of that new information, the Commission drew the conclusion that Italy had in fact taken the necessary steps to apply the milk quota system and reduce surplus production. As a result, the Commission has amended its original proposal and is now recommending that Italy should receive the full 900,000 tonnes of additional quota on a provisional basis for 1994–95, but that about a third of this should be held in a special reserve for allocation to producers who are currently in dispute with the Italian authorities over their individual quota awards.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
The speed with which the Commission changed its original proposal in favour of Italy is, to say the least, suspicious. And the new figures which have been presented by the Italian authorities give us cause for concern on two counts. First, the amended figure for Italian milk production in 1991–92—the base year on which Italy's additional quota was assessed—has been revised downwards. The Commission claims that that is the result of detailed checks which the Italians have only just completed. That may well be the case. But if the revised lower figure had been used as the starting point for the assessment of additional quota in December 1992, it is doubtful whether a figure of 900,000 tonnes would have been justified.<br><br>
Secondly it is not clear to us from the figures that the Italians have explained precisely how they have fulfilled their commitment to reduce milk production by 1.6 million tonnes. We have the impression that their claimed reduction may be more apparent than real since it seems to rely, at least in part, on the withdrawal of quota from farmers who have not produced a drop of milk for the past five years. In view of those concerns we will continue to have reservations about the Commission's revised proposal.<br><br>
In addition to those technical points, we have a more fundamental reservation about the allocation of additional quota to Italy—and to Spain and Greece for that matter. The Commission has made this proposition in the context of a package of proposals for CAP prices and related measures, which is unsatisfactory to us for a number of reasons. In particular, it would involve a 1 per cent. quota cut for all member states from 1994–95. We are opposed to that. It is not justified by the Commission's own analysis of the market situation in the dairy sector. Since the United Kingdom does not have enough quota as it is, a further arbitrary reduction, equivalent to about 150,000 tonnes of milk a year, would deal the British dairy industry a heavy blow. At a time when producers in the Mediterranean countries stand to benefit from additional quota, it is unacceptable that producers elsewhere should be facing a cut.<br><br>
We are not alone in making that point. The Benelux countries share our view as does Denmark. It is, of course, difficult to predict the outcome of the negotiations. However, I can assure the Committee that the Government will in no way support a price-fixing package that provides additional milk quota for Mediterranean milk producers while damaging the interests of British farmers—in particular by imposing a further arbitrary cut in milk quotas.<br><br>
However, there is a new Italian Government and a new Italian Minister of Agriculture, and my right hon. Friend the Minister will be interested to hear what he has to say about this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is strange to be back on this side of the Chairman's Bench. I have chaired only one of these Committees, so, if I make a mistake, I am sure that you will call me to order, Mr. Cook.<br><br>
This is an important matter, and I am glad that it has been referred to the Committee. Opposition Members endorse the Minister's line, but we have some suggestions about further action. However, now is the time to put questions to the Minister, and I have three for him. First, what have the Government done since 1989, through the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
Council of Ministers or the Commission, when it became clear that Italy was not complying? Secondly, do the Government accept the summary of figures that was produced by the Italian Government before the meeting of the Council of Ministers? We are told that Italians are the fraud kings of the European Union, and it seems that the Mafia could not have produced a better set of figures. Thirdly, will the Government unilaterally withhold implementation of our 1 per cent. cut in quota until Italy produces such genuine figures as are possible? Such a move would be popular with farmers and we would support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman and welcome him to his Front Bench role in the Committee.<br><br>
The Government have continually challenged the non-implementation of quota. However, the key agency in that matter is the Commission, which is the keeper of the Community's proper procedures. We have been supportive, for example, of the article 169 proeceedings against Italy in this matter and of the efforts concerning disallowance proceedings—a subject on which we take a robust stance and over which we have taken the Commission to the European Court for, in our view, being soft on Italy.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we accepted the figures, In my opening remarks I said that we were sceptical about some of the data; We have always been doubtful about the way in which Italy has acted and about how UNALAT was effectively handed all but the direct sales quota for Italy and then had to account for and apportion it. The fact that there has been a sudden shuffling of feet as moves are made to produce new data is significant in that respect. Commission document 5360/94 contains passages expressing powerful concern about the way in which milk quota was accounted for in Italy, and we share the concerns expressed in that useful document.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman suggested the tempting possibility that the Government could unilaterally withhold any one per cent. cut. I should take issue with him on that. Our present position is to negotiate hard for there not to be a 1 per cent. cut. I shall not comment on that because it would weaken our strong negotiating position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on his robust stand. What will be the impact of the cut on British milk producers? My hon. Friend said that it will mean a cut of 150,000 tonnes. What will it mean, in money terms, to the average milk producer? What will be the impact on the income of the average British farmer? How serious will it be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris), but I must side-step the direct question. My task is to underline today the Government's position of defending the powerful case that there should not be a 1 per cent. cut for United Kingdom producers. To anticipate or discuss the effects may weaken our negotiating position, which is not my intention. I cannot give a precise valuation off the top of my head. Clearly, that would be determined by the pool price for milk under the present arrangements. It is the equivalent of a 1 per cent. reduction in production—150,000 tonnes. Before the end of our sitting, I hope that I can supply a monetary value for that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Browning</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give further information on how the Government are challenging the statistics and accounts of the Commission? I understand that the accounts for 1989 are being challenged in the European Court of Justice and that other challenges are being made to undo the Commission's decisions about not just Italy, but Spain and Greece as well. Those challenges are not necessarily objections to quotas, but about the fact that the Commission backdates the increase to reduce the super-levy. Italy did not apply the quota as it should have. That will benefit it if the super-levy is halved, as the figures with which I have been provided show. It could be seen that the Commission is willing to take a more generous attitude toward Italy than toward other countries. What other measures are the Government taking to challenge those accounts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her question. It is important to distinguish between the action that the United Kingdom Government can take in all such matters and what other European institutions are actually doing. I do not want to detain the Committee on the detail, but the Court of Auditors report 4/93, which was published in the <i>Official Journal,</i> includes an important commentary on the accounts and on the qualifications and doubts. That points out the Court of Auditors' reservations about the way in which the statistics and levy calculations were conducted in all three countries.<br><br>
On the question of action, I must tell my hon. Friend that it is for the Commission to follow through action regarding the qualification of the accounts. Italy was subject to a disallowance of 56 million ecu in 1988, 220 million ecu in 1989 and 295 million ecu in 1990. The United Kingdom has taken action on the Commisssion's revision of its assessment of disallowance. That is why we have taken the Commission to the European court. We do not accept the basis of the calculation that the Commission has followed in determining the revised level of disallowance to which Italy should be subjected. We do not think that it is using the right figures. It is using too low a base and, on the basis of that calculation, has revised the Italian milk production figures. Therefore, we think that it has miscalculated the disallowance by about a factor of a half.<br><br>
We have been robust in taking the Commission to the European court on the basis that it was going soft on Italy. So, where we can act, we have done so strongly in the interests of proper accounting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a straightforward question for the Minister: is the production of milk in the United Kingdom below or above requirement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The straightforward answer is that production is below requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lidington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What consultations has my hon. Friend the Minister had with the National Farmers Union and with representatives of the British dairy industry on quotas? What is their attitude to the robust stance which, in my view, my hon. Friend has rightly taken?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These matters are part of the regular dialogue that all Ministers in the Department have. I know of no difference between any of the representatives of farming interests in Britain—either specifically concerned with dairy matters or to do with the NFU—which puts any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
distance between us. All are enjoined in the common cause of wanting to protect the interests of our dairy farmers, as I described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Court of Auditors is probably one of the European Union's most impressive institutions. The Minister referred to report 493 which is relevant to the matter that we are discussing. However, we have no documents from that report. Would nt it have been appropriate to have them before us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not my responsibility to distribute documents to the Committee, nor to have them available in the Room. It is in the official journal—<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am saying that I am not responsible personally.<br><br>
The document has been on the record for some time, but the principal subject of the debate is the addendum to the original report on how milk quotas have been administered by Greece, Spain and Italy, and also the market situation. Therefore, although the document is a crucial commentary on dairy activity in Europe, it is not one which is subject to debate this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What measures is our embassy in Rome taking to monitor the situation in Italy? Can my hon. Friend the Minister assure us that our agriculture attaché there is doing his utmost to keep an eye on things? Some of us who have questioned our embassies in other member states have been far from satisified that they are playing a proper role in acting as a check on what is happening on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives, that assurance. As the matter has evolved, we have cross-checked with our agriculture attaché that changes are being made to the way in which milk quotas are implemented, not only in Italy, but in Greece and Spain.<br><br>
It is important to know what is going on so that we can be satisfied and have the basis of information so that we can continue to probe if we are not satisfied that quotas are being implemented properly.<br><br>
My hon. Friend knows that part of the case that has been made for changing the milk quotas permanently has been the introduction of central agencies to administer milk quotas in the three countries involved. Our intelligence tells us that there are still doubts about the issue, in Greece, that it is early days in Italy and that Spain is working hard, but everything is not quite as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the Minister has confirmed that the United Kingdom's milk production is less than the market demands, and since the Commission is trying further to reduce milk production in the United Kingdom and has made it clear that in Spain, Italy and Greece milk quotas are not being implemented correctly, surely the time has come, in the interests of the United Kingdom milk industry, for the Government to abandon the whole idea of milk quotas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman assiduously follows the remarks that my right hon. Friend the Minister has made continuously since taking office—as I am sure that he does—he will be aware that his views on milk quotas entirely coincide with hers. We have made it very clear that the quota arrangement disadvantages British dairies—we have a natural advantage in milk production and we want the opportunity to show our strength. That is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
why we are worried about the proposals that we could be subjected to further cuts in milk quotas—we believe that the market has been inhibited.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman cares to go back through the records of the House, he will find an interesting milk regulation that proves that we have made some attempt to free up the dairy market to assist people while we have milk quotas. The right hon. Gentleman will know also that the United Kingdom and the Court of Auditors have tried to campaign for transferability of quota within the Community. Like the United Kingdom, Italy and Greece are below 100 per cent. self-sufficiency, while other countries are effectively over that level. We want the market quotas to be freer while it exists in Europe. We are in sympathy with what underlines the right hon. Gentleman's question, but we may not be able to pursue the matter of the Community's position on milk quotas until the turn of the century.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister say more about the role of the European Parliament in the matter? It has approved the Commission's proposals, subject to amendments and suggestions, and must be informed about any change in the view taken by the Council of Ministers. The Minister has told the Committee about the forces at work in the Council of Ministers with regard to the subject, but what forces are at work in the European Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I looked at the matter, I noted that the European Parliament had agreed to the Italian requirement for an additional quota of 900,000 tonnes, It seemed that the European Parliament had not probed as rigorously into the facts as the Government had. As I said, the matter remains in the melting pot: it is part of a wider package of measures presently before the Council of Ministers. Those measures are to be discussed by the European Parliament. I cannot anticipate the future, but my eyebrows rose when I understood that the European Parliament was disposed to agree with Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the Committee will endorse the motion before it, thus giving the Government the go-ahead to continue the argument. Eventually, matters will return to the Council of Ministers. What will happen then? The Minister said that the Benelux countries, Denmark and the United Kingdom oppose the Commission's proposals. Will it be possible to block those proposals, or to alter them sufficiently to satisfy our concerns?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may pick up a point of detail: the hon. Gentleman said that the matter must return to the Council of Ministers and it is true that further discussions must be held, but those discussions will form part of the wider deliberations on the price-fixing package being considered by the Council of Ministers. Each member state has stated its position on each item in that package, and I have outlined to the Committee the present views on the subject of milk quotas. The final outcome is not likely to separate milk from the wider considerations of the total package. I cannot anticipate the stance that member states will adopt, but I can say that the description that I gave the Committee about milk quotas was accurate. We shall have to return to the matter when the Council of Ministers next considers it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0517">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p>10.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 6428/94, relating to the application of the milk quota scheme in Italy; and endorses the line that the Government is taking in challenging the proposal that Italy should receive its additional milk quota in full for 1994–95.</p></blockquote>
I have made clear the Government's position on this question in the answers that I have already given to the Committee, but I shall take this opportunity to assist my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives, who wanted information about the 1 per cent. cut. That cut would be the equivalent of about £29 million-worth of milk production. It is therefore worth reflecting that that is why we are fighting hard on this package of issues; we genuinely do not want to see our dairy farmers disadvantaged. I said in my introductory remarks that Italy now has a new Government and a new Minister. The new Administration may well want to consider the matter and it will be aware of our strength of feeling and that of other member states on the subject.<br><br>
The report that underlies the addendum before us is impressive and clearly illustrates many of the deficiencies in the way in which quotas have been implemented in Greece, Spain and Italy, and the Commission's attempts to pull Italy, in particular, back in line. The matter will have to be dealt with once and for all; we have taken robust action against the Commission and I hope that there will be a satisfactory outcome for United Kingdom dairy farmers from the forthcoming negotiations.</span></p>
<p>10.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has become apparent that the Opposition support the Minister in taking the strongest possible line on the issue. But I should like to suggest again that when we negotiate with the Commission we made it clear that we will not impose a further cut on our farmers until we are certain that all other farmers in the European Union are implementing the quota system in the way that they should.</span></p>
<p>10.57 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Harris (St. Ives)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a member of the Select Committee on European Legislation, may I say that I and other members of that Committee felt that it was important that the issue, should be referred to this Committee because it is of immense concern to our farmers.<br><br>
The figure that my hon. Friend the Minister gave earlier, of a £29 million cost to our farmers if the additional one per cent. cut in quota were to go ahead, illustrates the justifiable anger of farmers that they should have been subjected to past cuts and now face future cuts because of the position of Italy, Spain and Greece. I find it extraordinary that the Commission and the European Union should set out to reward those three countries for not having put in place a quota system; they are actually being given a bonus for not doing what they should have done many years ago.<br><br>
At the end of last year, together with other members of the Select Committee on European Legislation I went to Greece and took the opportunity to question the Greek Minister of Agriculture on precisely what Greece was doing to meet the three criteria that had been laid down for the introduction of milk quotas. The Minister's answers were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
not just unconvincing, but a joke; Greece had taken one step, by setting up an agencey, but had done nothing else at all. Furthermore, when I questioned our own ambassador and the attaché who looked after trade—which included agriculture because we do not have an agriculture attaché in our embassy there—I was again dismayed that our own embassy in Greece did not really know what was happening, in Greece. That is why I have been running something of a campaign since then, aimed at my hon. Friend the Minister of State and my right hon. Friend the Minister, to ensure that our own posts in member states try to monitor, to the best of their ability, what is or is not happening. I was, therefore, delighted with my hon. Friend's answer because it illustrates, along with the evidence that he has presented today, that things are happening in the embassy in Rome and that a close eye is being kept on the situation. Will my hon. Friend ensure that that also happens in Spain and in Greece, where it clearly has not been happening? Quite frankly, I think that we should give a rocket to our embassies when they do not monitor the situation. One official did not even know what the three criteria were, so goodness knows how he could have been monitoring their progress. I hope that he will stiffen up our representation in those countries because, as he recognised, the only way in which he and my right hon. Friend the Minister can challenge the Commission and other Ministers in the Council of Ministers is to ensure that they know the position on the ground. I accept that the Commission has the main monitoring role, but we need to keep an eye on the Commission. What the Minister has said today amply illustrates that.<br><br>
The whole thing is an absolute scandal. Our farmers are justified in feeling extremely angry about it. I think that the Minister has convinced the Committee—he has certainly convinced me—that the Government's stand on the issue is a correct one. I would go as far as the hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) suggested, and I back what he said, which is that if this goes on, we should withhold any demand for a further cut in quota. Only when we start getting tough with the Commission will we get our case home.</span></p>
<p>11.1 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lidington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse every word that my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives has said and I too congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on the firm, robust stance that the Government are taking on the matter. When I talk to Buckinghamshire farmers, I am repeatedly struck by their justified anger and resentment at the way in which they have had to put up with the regulations that flow from the implementation of the common agricultural policy, while, if they look at the situation across the channel, they see farmers getting off scot free because of the idleness or plain dishonesty of the Governments of the member states concerned. It is only right that our Government should continue to press the Commission, the Italian Government and other Governments on the matter.<br><br>
I hope that it will prove possible to persuade the Commission and the other member states to take the required action. If not, there must come a point at which the United Kingdom stops meekly swallowing every regulation that comes out of Brussels while having to watch

everyone else sign up for some deal or other in the knowledge that when those signatories get home, they will take no action to ensure that the rules are obeyed.<br><br>
There is a broader political point, for which that issue can serve as an emblem. It is not just a question of farmers: we all know that there is widespread cynicism among the British electorate, regardless of individuals' political affiliations, about the ideals of European co-operation and unity. I believe that that mood of cynicism and distrust is bred by the sort of rule-breaking and inconsistency of which we have seen examples in the documentation before us today. If the Governments of the European union want to rekindle public enthusiasm for co-operation between sovereign nations of Europe, they must show that European unity is built on mutual trust and respect, and not upon a system that apparently rewards cheating and dishonesty.</span></p>
<p>11.4 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the remarks of my hon. Friends and of Opposition Members, who have obviously caught the sense of grave concern and of injustice that British dairy farmers feel. I am delighted to have heard such a robust stand from my hon. Friend the Minister and I hope that he will continue to fight for what is seen as a deeply unjust situation.<br><br>
I also agree with my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives that it is extraordinary to reward countries that have never implemented a regulation—which other countries, including Britain have implemented—by giving them extra quota. That will surely be a disincentive to comply with regulations in other areas of legislation. If other countries see what can be gained by non-compliance, that is hardly the example to set.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Minster will be aware that the grant was provisional and that a report at the end of the marketing year to 31 March 1994 to decide whether those awards should be permanent has made the situation worse. The figures that have been provided apparently cannot be trusted. Indeed, the figures that were supplied to me by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are not clear. We would not wish to proceed on those figures in relation to accountability, particularly of the Italians. It is of great concern that the Commission—which must be seen as the body that polices its own rules and regulations—has not made a more robust attempt to bring Italy into line and to produce figures that we can all agree on as our base line for future legislation.<br><br>
I remind members of the Committee of the comments made in <i>Agra Europe,</i> the weekly paper, on 22 April 1994. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The European Commission's decision to renege on the original decision to cut the Italian milk delivery quota increase of 900,000 tonnes marks the end of any serious attempt by the European Union to reform its dairy sector and to take any action to reduce its current chronic surplus of milk production. The recommendation to allow the Italian Government and dairy industry to get away with its blatant flouting of the milk quota rules will ensure that the other member states will not agree to any cuts in the Community's global milk delivery quota."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will accept the message expressed by members of the Committee that there should be strong resistance to the United Kingdom having to cut our quota further while such nonsense and, I have to say, deceitfulness is going on in other parts of the Community.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
In mitigation the Italian Agriculture Minister, Alfredo Diana, pointed out that Italy is only 60 per cent. self sufficient in milk, as though that is an excuse for noncompliance. As my hon. Friend knows, at certain times of the year the United Kingdom is deficient in milk, especially for the cheese-making industry. At times we have surplus and have to tip milk down the drain, and at other times there is a shortage for the food-processing industry. I hope that the Minister will resist such arguments because they do not stand up. We want robust arguments to be used to provide protection of the dairy farmers in this country. The problem is not just about milk; this proposal will set a precedent that will be emulated in other areas of legislation. I congratulate the Minister and I am sure that he will put up the robust defence that we are demanding today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have received ringing endorsements of our negotiating position. If I were now to go from this Room to the Council of Ministers in Brussels I am sure that I would take with me the support of hon. Members from both sides of the Committee. However, it will not be me sitting at the table in these discussions; it will be my right hon. Friend the Minister. But I can assure hon. Members that I shall take with me from the Committee the spirit and strength of views shared by both sides.<br><br>
I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Clwyd, South-West for the Government's stance on this matter. We have shown our strength of feeling by causing real upset in other member states by taking the Commission to the European Court over matters connected with this issue through disallowance. However, I have to say to the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members that we can be as robust as we like, but the negotiating position of all member states will ultimately decide these matters. We shall continue to take a robust line in defending the interests of Britain's dairy farmers and to reflect the concerns that have rightly been put to the Committee by all hon. Members, but in the end it will depend on what other member states think about the issue.<br><br>
As always—quietly and behind the scenes, but robustly—we try to strengthen our community partners in their view of the matter. Sometimes we are successful, sometimes not.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives mentioned the question of intelligence. I am glad that he continues to apply pressure on that issue. It is important that we know what is going on, and I shall redouble my efforts in that regard because I do not want my hon. Friend to visit other parts of the European Union and than tell me that someone does not know what is going on. However, I think that the matter has been put right for Italy.<br><br>
Much of the debate has concentrated on Italy, where the problem is most shambolic. In fairness, it must be said that Greece's central agency has tried to correct the matter, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives said, the attempt has not been satisfactory and we have commented accordingly. However, we should acknowledge the work done by Spain's central agency to impose individual quotas. We were worried about accountability regarding direct sales quota, but member states appear to be satisfied with Spain's efforts. The Commission will keep an eye on the matter.<br><br>
It is worth pointing out that our robust stand on the matter protected the interests of Britain's dairy farmers and meant that they did not suffer this milk year from the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
original 1 per cent. cut. Sometimes we forget our past achievements when we concentrate on future issues, but we can take some pride from that.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)—whom I thank for his support—and for Tiverton (Mrs. Browning) caught the mood of the Committee and the dairy industry on the matter. Both emphasised the importance of equivalence of enforcement of Community policy. In my role as fisheries Minister, I know how crucial that is for the credibility of common policies. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton quoted from <i>Agra Europe</i> and this helped to explain precisely why the United Kingdom has taken such a robust stand with regard to the European Court. It is important that people look at the facts.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mrs. Barnes) mentioned the Court of Auditors, which is becoming more involved in such questions. That is healthy and we support the Court of Auditors' work. It is galling to think that we must consider additional quota, but the probing exercises that have unmasked Greece, Spain and Italy have shown that their real milk production is far ahead of the paper position used to calculate quota. A genuine attempt is being made to regularise the matter so that we can see what is going on. There was a genuine understatement of Spain's position when it joined the Community. We may have to accept a degree of manoeuvrability.<br><br>
In conclusion, my right hon. Friend the Minister will be robust in the interests of Britain's dairy farmers. This debate will have strengthened her position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister started his speech by pointing out that the negotiating stance of other nations would help to determine the final outcome, regardless of how vigorous the United Kingdom has been in the Council of Ministers and in other European Union institutions. If the final decision is not congruent with the views expressed in this Committee, will we get a full report on the way that decision was made.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that a statement is issued at the end of each Agriculture Council meeting by the Minister who has attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman has the opportunity to probe that report by means of written or oral parliamentary questions. When my right hon. Friend the Minister emerges from the Council, I am sure that she will be subject to public scrutiny by the press. Therefore, in addition to the usual correspondence, there are many opportunities to probe thoroughly the Government's position. Clearly, our task is to make public the reasons why we do not believe that there should be a further 1 per cent.- cut. That must be our strong starting point in the negotiations.</span></p>
