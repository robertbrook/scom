	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Stàte, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to set out the Government's views on these important issues. However, before I do so I should like to deal with a procedural matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have noticed on today's Order Paper that the Government have already tabled a motion reporting that the Committee has supported the Government's motion. I want to make it clear that I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of this morning's debate. However, as hon. Members will appreciate, to complete the full scrutiny process of the documents during what remains of this Session of Parliament, a motion requesting the approval of the House must be tabled today. The Government judged it right to hold the debate before Prorogation to ensure that the House had the chance to express its views in full before the next Fisheries Council on 23 November, when the integration of Spain and Portugal into the common fisheries policy will be discussed again. It is possible mat decisions will be reached then, although I believe that the matter will not be resolved until the December Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I previously dealt with the matter in Parliament when I gave evidence before the Select Committee on 25 May. The April 1994 Fisheries Council had already adopted the guidelines to be found in document 15274. Those guidelines, published on 30 May as Council regulation 1275/94, established a clear set of principles that the Commission should follow in drawing up detailed proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those principles were that there should be no relaxation in the current Iberian rules until detailed replacement rules had been adopted by the Council; that relative stability should be fully respected; that there should be no increase in fishing effort in any area; that specific reference should be made to the Irish Box—under the Iberian Act of Accession, it lapses on 31 December 1995—as a sensitive area requiring special consideration thereafter; and that there should be no obligation to grant Spain access to other areas, including the North Sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 25 August, three months after the 1 June deadline, the Commission published the two proposals before us today. That is why today is the earliest practicable date for debate. The first proposal sets out rules of access to specified western waters, from the Faroes to the Azores and along the Atlantic coast of north Africa. Under that proposal, member states' access would be limited to a number of standard vessel days, defined by species and by area. However, that proposal did not set out how those standard vessel days should be allocated by member states
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
to their fishermen. The second proposal sets out detailed arrangements for monitoring compliance with the access proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those proposals were founded on dubious assumptions. They were excessively complex and bureaucratic. They flouted the Commission's undertaking, which I had secured at the June Council, that the proposals must minimise bureaucracy. As a result, I was in the forefront of the argument that the proposals were unacceptable. The majority of member states took the same view. The general opinion was that it would not have been possible to implement them fairly or to enforce them properly. The failure to address adequately the commitment to give special protection to the area of the Irish Box was a key concern to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. There were also serious doubts about the methodology adopted by the Commission in working out the detail of the access proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Fisheries Council on 28 September, the presidency invited member states to put forward alternative ideas for a much simpler and more operable system for the presidency and the Commission to consider. I had full and extremely useful discussions with the British fishing industry, which was united in its views on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking those views fully into account, I put forward an alternative approach based on key objectives: no change to relative stability and no increase in fishing effort; access to western waters to be limited to vessels with estalished rights in the areas concerned; the United Kingdom to have an effective role in monitoring the access arrangements for vessels of all nations in its own western waters; special treatment for highly sensitive zones, of which the Irish Box must be one; to assist enforcement, larger vessels to be subject to reporting requirements when entering or leaving the areas covered by the regulations and to report catches, and technical conservation measures to be strengthened. The presidency is currently considering our ideas and those of other member states, and technical discussions are continuing. As I have said, the Council will next address the issue on 23 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee has noted, of relevance to the debate are the Commission's proposals for setting specific management objectives and strategies for a four-year period. Those proposals have been on the table since December. Discussion is not far advanced and decisions are not expected before next year. However, for the Committee's information, the ideas under discussion are for sophisticating the approach to fisheries stock management. They include the new concept of total allowable effort, multi-annual and multi-species total allowable catches and quota flexibility between years. There are some ideas of value, but further and more focused technical consideration is required before we can accept them as a basis for taking management decisions. The Commission has already acknowledged that the 1995 TACs will be agreed along traditional lines, thereby allowing more time for further detailed assessment of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protection of sustainable fisheries arises also in another document that we shall consider today, namely the Commission's report on the progress of member states under their multi-annual guidance programmes. Those programmes originally focused only on capacity, but they now address the broader concept of fishing effort, with a view to achieving a better balance between the fishing effort
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
exerted by the fleet and the stocks of fish in the sea. Each member state has been set a target to be achieved by the end of 1996. The document sets out the progress that has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that I have spoken for perhaps a little longer than is normal, but we are discussing complex and important matters. Several documents are before us, and I hope that my introduction has been helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to several important issues presently facing the fishing industry. He made a good case about the problems of the Commission's proposals in relation to management procedures for the revision of the Irish Box. They were based on days-at-sea, which the Ministry proposed originally to use in this country as a tool in meeting its multi-annual guidance programme. The Ministry has done a good job in demonstrating the weakness in the Commission's proposals on the bureaucracy and difficulties involved. Does that not, however, demonstrate the basic weaknesses inherent in a days-at-sea management technique? Has the Minister considered the Government's approach to that matter in terms of the future management offish stocks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, I make a request for shorter questions. This is question time; there will be time for debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission's proposals, in our view, were flawed, because its mechanism for controlling the effort of Community fleets in the western waters was based on a formula known as standard vessel days. The mathematical factors behind the formula were also, in our view, flawed. There were serious problems in the way in which the effort was divided among member states. We believed that it was grossly unfair to the United Kingdom, that it was grossly complex, too bureaucratic and not properly administrable. You asked me how—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not ask a question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir David. The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) asked how the analysis of standard vessel days impacted on the Government's ideas about days at sea. The two concepts are distinct in their approach. One was clearly worked out and it drew on existing records; there were mechanisms that enabled fishermen to see how their days were allocated and what they had received. One of the fundamental flaws in the Commission's proposal was that it left totally blank how member states' allocation of standard vessel days would be distributed to individual fisherman. That was a further reason why we dismissed the proposals. As the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) knows, our ideas on the control of effort are currently the subject of a case in the European Court. Until that matter is resolved, I cannot look beyond the present situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless those or any rules can be enforced, there will be no point whatsoever to them. Can the Minister assure us that whatever is proposed will have two effects: first, that it will cut the Spanish fleet's access to British fishing grounds and, secondly, that it will be enforceable immediately?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich [Mrs Dunwoody) has put her finger on what I consider to be one of the most important issues. Our industry can have no confidence in whatever successor regime results from the current proposals unless it can be properly enforced. I assure the hon. Lady that I shall pursue that theme as vigourously as I possibly can. I want to be able to tell our fishermen that enforcement can be properly carried out. We have made some progress in that respect. There is a strong emphasis in the Council's thinking on ensuring that the flag states—the member states whose surrounding waters will be affected by the proposals—will have a key part in the enforcement process. That is important in building confidence in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked me whether the proposal would cut the access of the Spanish fleet. The problem is that the present restrictions on the Spanish fleet's access to, for example, the Irish Box, result from the treaty of accession signed for Spain and Portugal. Our task is to control the effort of the Spanish fleet when there is no Irish Box and no basic and periodic list. The Commission chose the route of standard vessel days; we have proposed something much nearer to what the hon. Lady would like, which is in various sectors of the western waters to control the Spanish effort that could be applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On monitoring the Spanish or Iberian fleet in western waters, how does the Minister define the effective role of the United Kingdom? Who will be responsible? Will it be the Community or the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Effectively, for western waters, monitoring will be the role of each member state in its own waters. It is not proposed to have a Community-wide monitoring arrangement, but I draw the hon. Lady's attention to the control regulation which came into force on 1 January, which gives Community inspectors the ability to inspect at random and without prior notice the way in which enforcement is being carried out by Member states. I attach great importance to that, particularly in respect of enforcement activities in Spain. That will be an important point to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for enforcement are not yet fully worked out. The papers before the Committee this morning are proposals that have now been set aside by the Fisheries Council. New proposals are now under active consideration by the presidency, with a view to presenting them to the Council on 23 November. It is certainly helpful to have heard two members of the Committee highlight the importance that they attach to enforcement. I assure them that I shall properly reflect that in our remarks on whatever revised proposals come before the Council on 23 November.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has told us that, following the Fisheries Council on 28 September, the British Government suggested that there should be no change in relative stability and that there should be no cuts in quota. If the Spanish and, possibly, the Portuguese are to have access to the Irish Box—which must entail increased effort—how can the Government maintain their position on no cuts in quotas, given the overriding need to maintain fishing stocks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several parts to the question of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger). Quotas are already dealt with separately from whatever level of effort
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
is represented by European fleets. The numerical quotas which are available to member states and which are broken down to individual fishermen can be maintained without having any impact on that level. The quota you are given does not change under the proposals—we wanted to underscore that as, under the Commission's flawed proposals, there was doubt that there would have been enough standard vessel days to enable fishermen to catch the allocated quotas. That is another reason for our saying that the original idea was grossly unfair to the United Kingdom. There were serious doubts, especially when you make comparisons with the number of standard vessel days that had been allocated to the Irish Republic, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to relative stability in fishing effort, you are right to underscore—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not doing very well this morning. I have offered no opinion in those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Sir David. If certain Opposition Members had not kept us up until such a late hour last night, my mental processes might have been better focused. I was responding to the hon. Member for Pembroke, and I had prefaced my remarks by referring to him by name. I apologise if I deviated in your direction, Sir David. I shall try to focus on the hon. Gentleman's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right about relative stability and no increase in fishing effort, which we prayed in aid as fundamental principles. In the regulation that the Fisheries Council agreed to, it underpinned the important relative positions of member states under the new arrangements. The difficulty is that, because of the treaty that I mentioned in response to the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, the Irish Box, as a line on the map, lapses at the end of 1995. We fought hard for the co-ordinates that are the Irish Box to be specifically defined in the regulation as a sensitive zone. Our proposals recognised that we needed a policy to deal with the Irish Box and certainly with the Irish Sea, where stocks are under great pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will see, if he examines the detail of our proposal, that we have said that there needs to be a policy for sensitive zones, of which the Irish Box is one. There are other sensitive zones: for example, Portugal is concerned about Madeira and the Azores, and France is concerned about the bay of Biscay. The Council must return to the matter, for precisely the reason that the hon. Gentleman mentioned—the protection offish stocks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share common cause in our anxieties about the Irish Box as a sensitive zone. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall press the matter hard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask what appears to be a simple question, but it may be rather complicated. If the Government were successful in achieving their aims in negotiation—that is, that there should be no change to relative stability, that there should be no increase in fishing effort, and that access must be on the basis of established rights in the area—would that result in the loss of any fishing days or fishing quotas for any British fishing vessels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Loss of days is not an issue, as we have challenged the proposition that would deal with the allocation of standard vessel days. We are relying on the ground that that is not what we want. The majority of member states in the Fisheries Council registered their varying degrees of concern. The Commission has set the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
matter aside and has invited alternatives. There are variations on the theme of alternatives, but we are moving away from the allocative mechanism that was represented by standard vessel days in the thinking of other member states. I cannot anticipate what the presidency will suggest as a final proposal for the Council on 23 November, but my short answer is that the United Kingdom will make it clear that standard vessel days are not acceptable. I shall do all that I can to lobby other fishery Ministers on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On quotas, it is certainly my view that there should be no loss of the ability to take quota. It is important for the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) to understand that the quotas will be the subject of a separate negotiation in the December meeting of the Fisheries Council; they are not part of these proposals. In our criticism of the Commission's original proposal, we made it absolutely clear that questions had been asked about the number of standard vessel days available with regard to taking existing quotas. We pointed out that such a formulation was utterly unacceptable if it meant that we could not take quotas. I believe that that line of argument has been generally accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we are in the middle of negotiations, I never like to give unequivocal guarantees that certain things will happen, but within the balance of probabilities, I cannot foresee a formulation that would not enable our fishermen to take quota. Bearing in mind that Spain is seeking to be the beneficiary of the changes, I hardly think that the Spaniards would want to sign up to a mechanism that would not enable them to get whatever quotas had been allocated to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has conceded the importance of the principle of relative stability. Will he undertake to ensure that as far as he is concerned, that principle is non-negotiable, that the Commission and the Council of Ministers recognise that it is non-negotiable and that the Spanish and Portuguese recognise that it is non-negotiable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read in detail the current framework regulation from which we are working, so he will know that that principle is enshrined in it and that member states have agreed to it. Therefore, there can be no more negotiation about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister read any proposals about mesh size and does he intend to discuss the application of particular rules on equipment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Crewe will know—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Crewe and Nantwich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to those parts of Cheshire that I omitted from the hon. Lady's constituency—a delightful part of the country. I can tell the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich that technical conservation measures were the subject of one of the items in our proposal. That matter was emphasised and was included at the request of the industry. It is one of the negotiating platforms on which we stand. I cannot say how other member states will view that issue, but we have attached sufficient importance to it that it is one of our key points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's clear assurance that the principle of relative stability will be safeguarded by him. What would happen if the Spanish threatened to use their veto on the widening of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
membership of the European Union if principles such as relative stability were not changed to give them greater allocation in the share-out of the Irish Box?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must draw the attention of the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe to the fact that Council decisions are taken on qualified majority voting. That matter is not one that can be vetoed in the Council. The hon. Gentleman may be thinking of the Spanish Parliament and the stance that it wants to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be linked in the Spanish mind, but it is a matter for the Spanish Parliament to decide. But, for the Fisheries Council, I have described accurately the voting mechanism that will be deployed. Clearly, it is a matter for the Spanish Parliament to decide whether it wishes to continue sabre rattling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the negotiations, my stall has been laid out on the basis of personal representation to other Community fisheries Ministers. I will travel to meet many of them personally and contact by other means those whom I am unable to meet face to face, to press our case. It may take until the end of the year to resolve the matter and the political landscape may well have changed by then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Coe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his opening remarks, my hon. Friend mentioned, rightly, the need to move away from an overly bureaucratic scheme and to focus more sharply on the Commission's proposals on technical considerations. On which specific areas should there be a sharper focus?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is considerable concern about undersized fish, focused mainly on evidence from Spain. Our industry has made the most powerful representations, emphasising that if, under current proposals, Spain were allowed to fish in waters where at present it is denied access, the misuse of nets to enable under-sized fish to be caught would have a profound impact on the future stock for the fishing industry. We have reflected those concerns by introducing our theme of technical conservation measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, we are not privy to everyone's further considerations. The matter continues to unwind; it is an ever-changing situation. The question about under-sized fish relates closely to earlier questions on the subject of enforcement. We must deal with them by reassuring our fishermen about the long-term viability of stock under whatever successor regime may emerge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say how influential in recent negotiations was the possible accession of Norway to the European Union when the possibility of Iberian integration into the common fisheries policy was debated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asks a pertinent question. Last December, we had agreed a regulation that might have given us a more relaxed timetable for those events. I was very satisfied with it. As a delegation we had worked hard to change the Commission's starting point on the arguments, which was a so-called "blank-cheque policy" acknowledging that changes would occur but offering no detailed proposals. We secured what I have described as a stepping-stone framework regulation, which enabled us to take the matter forward on a more measured time scale.

As a result of the enlargement negotiations that took place at the beginning of the year, in which Norway's entry to the Community was clearly an issue, it was agreed that a specific timetable would be laid down for the agreement—I emphasise the agreement—on the revised—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I would say that it was part and parcel of a broad negotiation in which the interests of a country such as Norway, which has an important fishing industry, were taken into account. Likewise Spain considers that an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go wider and discuss matters of cohesion and cod fishing off north Norway, but I am sure that with her knowledge of fishing matters, the hon. Lady understands that all such matters became enmeshed together. The simple result was that a timetable requiring us to reach a conclusion by the end of the year was imposed on the Fisheries Council, but it did not alter the timetable for the measures to come into effect. That is still 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told us that in his view—and I am sure the Committee agrees—the Irish sea is a particularly sensitive area. In his negotiations, will he take the position that the Spanish should be excluded from sensitive areas such as the Irish sea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Pembroke studies the proposals and the principles carefully, he will see that we recognise the view that he is putting forward. In our proposal, we accept that entry to sensitive zones should be on the basis of an established historic pattern of fishing. At present, the Irish Box does not provide certain countries with such a pattern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A key issue is established access rights. Such terms can be loaded and can have different meanings for different people. Will the Minister define what he means by "established access rights" for UK vessels and for Spanish vessels?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taking that question precisely, I mean that British vessels are allowed to fish in the Irish Box and can demonstrate an established history of fishing whereas Spanish fishing vessels are expressly unable to fish in the Irish Box and are not able to demonstrate an historic right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I can be precise in my terms and make a case that defends the UK's interests, other members of the Council will take a different view on how the removal of the Irish Box should be handled. The first proposal considered by the Council was the Commission's. UK Ministers have given reasons for their view that the proposal was flawed; one was that the Commission did not define the Irish Box as a sensitive zone. It had a more fluid formulation for attempting to deal with the restrictions on Spanish fishing activity under new arrangements. We found those arrangements flawed and put forward our own proposals. I think that I have made it clear to the Committee that other member states are now reformulating their positions in the light of the Commission's challenge: "If you don't like our idea, find another one." We now have the opportunity to find out how other member states view the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question asked by the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland touched on an important point. We shall continue to stand our ground, but we must realise that there may be 11 other versions that will have to be debated in the Fisheries Council. Our task will be to plot, through the various formulations, the best way in which to secure the interests of our fishermen. I know what my objectives are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
but, as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland will understand, we are in a negotiation. It is unlikely that everyone else will sit back and say that the UK has come up with the best possible idea, and agree to it without any amendment or debate. That would be an unrealistic view. I hope that I have made it clear where we stand in the negotiations; I shall do my best to sell our proposal to fisheries Ministers of other Community countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will pardon me if I have more bags under my eyes this morning than there are secret holes on a Spanish Trawler. We welcome the Minister's robust stance in stopping the Spanish plundering our seas. Hon. Members are aware that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is putting pressure on the Ministry of Defence in relation to a European army. I should welcome the Minister's assurance that he will not buckle under any Foreign and Commonwealth Office pressure to capitulate on interests that affect our fishermen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) been a fly on the wall in the enlargement negotiations earlier this year, he would have noted that unlike those of some member states, UK fisheries Ministers attended that Council and took part in negotiating on fishery issues. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office—I hope that no one from the FCO reads this bit of 	<i>Hansard—took</i> a slight sideways step in deference to the complexities of the fishery issues. That comment was slightly tongue in cheek; the FCO clearly understood the sensitivity of the matter and made certain that during parts of the negotiations in which it was relevant for UK fisheries Ministers to be present, we were able to put the case for our industry and to safeguard its interests. We shall continue to underscore those interests if they are challenged from within Government. As I believe my hon. Friend clearly understands, this is a negotiation. Many forces will be brought to bear within the Community to try to find a solution. However, I am clear about our objectives and we shall fight our corner with vigour, from wherever the pressure comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is interested to know where the Minister stands at the beginning of the negotiation but, frankly, it is much more concerned about where he will finish at the end. What is the timetable? He has said that 23 November is so important that the procedures of the House of Commons must be flouted to assume the acceptance by this Committee of the matter before us today. He then said that 23 November forms only part of the negotiation. Moreover, if this negotiation continues for a long time, will the status quo remain in force or will there be an interregnum without proper legal controls?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To reply to the hon. Lady's last point, the status quo will remain until a change is agreed by the Fisheries Council. There is no intermediate step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that I had made it clear that we meant no discourtesy whatever to the House in following this procedure. It is a moving target and there have been delays, especially by the Commission in furnishing official papers on its position. The delays are not of our making. We were anxious to debate the matter as early as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
I attached importance to 23 November, but I also said that I did not believe that that would be the date on which agreement would be reached. However, we are under the strictures of an agreed timetable so inevitably, I believe, the matter will be caught up in the December Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady reflects on the task in hand and the working time that is available for dealing with these complex issues, she may recognise that our simple, straightforward proposals have much to commend themselves in their applicability. One problem with the Commission's original idea was its sheer complexity and I suspect that in trying to tease it out and make it a workable solution, time would have run out. The fact that simpler formulations, playing much more to our tune, would help to fit the timetable strengthens our position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that enforcement is an important matter. The Government have said that there may be a requirement for the reporting of catches. How would that work? Could the coastal state require reporting in before a vessel left its territorial waters or will reporting back take place once the vessel has landed its catch?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a way, I might side-step that issue because it very much reflects the Commission's proposal. It had the most amazing series of features about reporting in and out and catches for vessels of all sizes. That was partly why we rejected it; it was not practicable. The size of vessels and catch data may be an issue. However, to comment on the Commission's proposal is to give it a credibility that I do not wish it to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the matter of the other paper before the Committee, which the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks, and the progress of countries towards achieving multi-annual guidance programme targets, what progress has the Minister made in being able to quantify, in terms of MAGP targets, technical conservation measures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to hang my head in shame because I cannot quantify that, for a simple reason. We genuinely set out to discuss that point with the Commission, in the light of the industry's helpful papers. We are still in discussion with it on the matter, pressing the arguments and reflecting technical conservation as an issue. As an acknowledgement of that line of argument, we can, perhaps, negotiate some small changes in some of the sectoral targets before us to reflect the nature and type of our fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations produced a helpful paper that highlighted a more comprehensive view of what could be achieved. We are some way from allowing such measures to be counted against our target if fully applied throughout the industry. However, I have not given up. Our ideas on technical conservation playing a part are included in the Spanish-Portuguese proposals. We are trying to push the matter whenever we can, but I cannot post immediate progress and, thus, I cannot quantify it as the hon. Gentleman requests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are trying to reach the multi-annual guidance programme targets, is our fleet's decommissioning scheme nearer to bringing capacity and resources into balance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made an advance since the hon. Lady and I previously discussed the matter. I confirm that the remaining parts of our £25 million programme will occur.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
When the matter was discussed previously, there was doubt in the industry about whether the second or third phases would occur, particularly in the light of other problems. I made our views clear. The second tranche of decommissioning, on which £8.3 million was spent, has been extremely successful. It will bring us 2.6 per cent, nearer our target. I am confident that the third tranche will be more or less able to match it. It will cost slightly less because we rolled over some of the underspend on the first tranche into the second. I believe that decommissioning will more than meet the original MAPG targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told us that the United Kingdom proposals to the Fisheries Council on 23 November will include a proposal that we should play a significant part in monitoring technical changes, conservation, size of catch and so on. That would be a significant increase in the role of the United Kingdom fishery protection fleet. Who will pay? Will it be the Commission or the United Kingdom Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The control regulation that took affect on 1 January already provides enhanced rigorous procedures to monitor catches, which we have accommodated. The monitoring of the arrival of catches at the quayside needs to be considered separately from the reporting requirements mentioned earlier. Those are subject to discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposals were onerous. That is partly why we said that we did not want such an approach. It would have been complex and bureaucratic and would have been a considerable burden on member states. I cannot anticipate what the next stage will hold for us because we have yet to see clearly what the presidency compromise proposals will be. We have opted for a simple regime, that can be accommodated within our existing mechanisms for fishery protection. However, we emphasise that coastal states should have a powerful role. I say with some pride that we have an efficient enforcement mechanism. However, if the arrangements are ultimately changed, we want to be able to keep a close eye on matters. We would look carefully at our patterns of monitoring and enforcement—I know that other member states, including the Irish, will do the same—to ensure that whatever comes about can be properly monitored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon. Member for Pembroke that another method of enforcement is in the distance—that is, the advanced electronic monitoring of the location of fishing vessels. The hon. Gentleman knows that about 40 United Kingdom vessels are taking part in Community trials on real-time satellite monitoring. It is our view that, although the technology may be capable, it is extremely expensive and there are other ways to locate vessels. We are also evaluating automatic position recorders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are technically able, without interference, to pinpoint accurately where vessels are, what they are doing, their speed, and whether they are fishing. That will be relevant in future with regard to enforcement issues. I cannot be absolutely precise, but several factors presently affect enforcement, all of which will be relevant to the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What effect will the defence cuts have on enforcement? The Minister seems to suggest that he would expect the Government to have control over enforcement procedure in such highly sensitive areas. He must know that, because of cuts not only in the defence
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
forces, but in the civilian civil service, there will be far fewer effective means of monitoring in the future than there have been even in the rather inadequate past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just signed a new agreement with the Royal Navy on enforcement in England and Wales. It has not rung up—	<i>[Interruption.].</i> It welcomed the opportunity to be engaged. We all saw how effective the Royal Navy was in the disputes over tuna during the summer. There was available capacity within the Royal Navy to deal with that issue. Our capacity remains undiminished in terms of our agreement The Royal Navy is giving very good value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, also has an enforcement procedure that is undiminished by any changes in the defence sector. I can safely say to the hon. Lady that, whatever happens in the overview of naval matters, it will not have an impact on our enforcement procedure in the immediate future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said to the hon. Member for Pembroke, other aspects of enforcement are now being evaluated by the European Union. We cannot ignore those developments because they add a new dimension. Some member states, such as Portugal, already have extensive systems for their internal purposes. They are evaluating their effectiveness. Developments are moving quickly. Clearly, as always, cost 	<i>v.</i> effectiveness will be the final determinant as to which systems are used. Enforcement continues to be important and I attach great weight to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be the end of question time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.17 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee takes note of the unnumbered Explanatory Memorandum submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 19 April, relating to fisheries: Spanish and Portuguese arrangements, and of European Community Documents Nos. 8940/94, relating to Community fishing areas and resources, relating to fisheries; multi-annual guidance programme 1993; and supports the Government's determination to secure measures to safeguard the fish stocks around the United Kingdom's shores and to protect the interest of United Kingdom fisheries through its fisheries policies.</p></q>
We have had an interesting question time; it touched on many issues. To summarise the position, we have made it clear that we have developed a concept for changes in the Community's fisheries policy that reflects the protection of the interests of United Kingdom fishermen. Our own policy, as detailed, is clear, simple, straightforward, enforceable and immediately applicable. It recognises particularly the importance of sensitive zones, as the Irish sea, and it is based on sound principles of no increase in fishing effort and relative stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall embark on a series of visits to other European Union Fisheries Ministers to press and explain the United Kingdom case. I have, however, to live in the real world and given that the word "compromise" is used, I recognise that the presidency will also listen to the views of other member states on the matter. Not every member state will agree with the United Kingdom's position, and the presidency's task will be to weld together an alternative view to that of the Commission to put before the Council on 23 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reaching the present position, I had extremely good support from the industry in Scotland, England and Wales and Northern Ireland. It is perhaps one of those rare occasions when there is remarkable unanimity. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
industry has been helpful in enabling us to work out our position. We shall continue to consult closely with it at each stage in the negotiations. They will not be easy, and there may be changes to the proposals that we have put forward, but our task is to safeguard the intersests of our fishermen, particularly those who enjoy protection from Spanish fishing effort in and around the Irish sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of sensitive zones affects other member states, as I have said—for example, the French and Portuguese—so they will consider such matters closely. I shall continue to do what I can to keep hon. Members with fishing interests closely informed of developments and of our proposals as we proceed. The negotiations will be difficult, but we shall press our case with vigour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.20 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much unanimity on the Government's approach to the issue so far, particularly with regard to the Spanish and Portuguese accessions. The documents cover a wide area. Naturally, the discussion rightly focused on the accession agreements because of their implications for the Irish sea, the North sea and all of our waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The committee agrees on the principles of relative stability, no increase in effort, access rules, the problems of standard vessel days, monitoring compliance, the complex rules proposed by the Commission, the issues of sensitive areas, and methodology. The Labour party agrees that the Minister was quite right to reject the previous Commission proposal, for the reasons that he has given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, differences between us remain on several issues of fishing policy linked to the accession negotiations. They are brought out by the documents before us, and have been mentioned during question time. One concerns the multi-annual guidance programme. For some years, Opposition Members have argued that the Government's decommissioning scheme has not been adequate. That is shown each year when we read the Commission's report on this country's progress in meeting our targets. The documents show that we have not even met the intermediate targets. That demonstrates that the present scheme has not been sufficient to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall also strike a note of discord—perhaps not with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office—concerning an issue upon which the Minister touched. Hon. Members may recall that, during the negotiation of the European economic area agreement with Norway, we felt that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was not putting the interests of the fishing industry first and was far more concerned with the wider political issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall meeting Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials with my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) and representatives of the United Kingdom fishing industry because of our concern about the allocation of Norwegian cod to our country as part of the agreement. It was felt that that issue was being ignored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in its attempt to reach the wider agreement. Such concern remains, as I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members support the principle of enlargement and look forward to the Scandinavian countries joining the European Union. However, as the Minister pointed out, the Spanish Parliament has threatened to veto the enlargement agreements if Spain does not have its own way
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
on the fishing issue. The Spanish have made clear their dedication to having their own way and following their own agenda. It is vital that we take the interests of our fishing industry as seriously as do the Spanish—despite our differences with their approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, given the delicate balance in Norway concerning the vote for accession, if the Fisheries Council on 23 November puts in place mechanisms that might in future apply to the North sea, that could have an important influence on the referendum in Norway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Fishing interests will be one of the key issues in the Norwegian referendum and Norway will consider the matter carefully. Of all the countries approaching referendums, it is Norway in which the outcome is most finely in the balance. This issue could tip the balance one way or the other—I am sure that the Minister is well aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other issues arise from the documents. Stock management is linked to attempts to agree the accession of the Iberian countries while not increasing effort within our seas. That is a difficult balance to strike. The days-at-sea measure has been put forward as a mechanism for dealing with that. There is still some concern about the way in which days-at-sea measures work. I was disappointed to hear from the Minister that there has not been an effective evaluation of the technical conservation measures put forward by the Scottish, English and Welsh industries. Those proposals could make a major contribution towards matching effort with variable fish stocks and towards ensuring that there is a sustainable fisheries industry. There are still problems with managing our fish stocks, with too much effort and with recruitment. I am pleased that there is a great deal of co-operation between the industry and the Ministry on the matter. The industry has been arguing that any scheme from the Council of Ministers—I agree with the Minister that there will not be a deal until December, rather than November—must be simple to understand and operate, and preferably not based on days-at-sea. There should be reductions in the restrictions on Spanish activity. Some mechanisms of the Irish Box should be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the agreement has to be changed—the difficulty faced by the Minister. The question of sensitive areas could be used to deal with some of the problems of the Irish Box and access. There could be licensing arrangements in conjunction with other member states with similar concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are about to become inquorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is the issue of technical measures. I am pleased to read in the documents that the Commission recognises the value of technical measures. There is a section on nephrops and the Commission recognises the role of separater trawls. Such measures need to be developed further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have made strong points on the question of enforcement. Enforcement should be managed and controlled by the coastal member states and we should have enforcement control over our fishing grounds. I have often made it clear that the Labour party would not object to multinational spot checks on member state enforcement to make sure that regulations are being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
enforced. There have been allegations that some member states have more effective enforcement—shall we say—than others. Principal enforcement must remain with our country and with our fisheries enforement service, which has done a fair and impartial job and deserve some tribute for that. It is important that that position is not weakened. There is a case for stronger enforcement on the western approaches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.28 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I shall begin with a complaint. Although the Minister is fair and says that he means no discourtesy to the Committee, if the House of Commons is to monitor the constant flow opf legislation from the Community it is important for the Committee to be treated seriously. Ministers who are under the restraints of timetables not initiated by themselves must bear in mind that the Committee's task is to examine closely whatever matters are brought before it and to make a recommendation to the House. Whatever the Minister says, the tabling of a motion accepting the documents we are considering today before they have been discussed by the Committee amounts to an assumption—I am not saying that the assumption is incorrect—that the Minister has the agreement of the Committee before it has sat. That is not a satisfactory way in which to proceed, and I trust that it will not happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment briefly on the negotiation of the fisheries policy. I do not have detailed knowledge of the fishing industry, although I was a west country Member of Parliament and have seen the devastating effect on the inshore fisheries of our accession to the Community. However, I have a detailed knowledge of politics, which I have acquired over a long time. I tell the Minister that we shall require savage protection of British interests—whatever the proposals are, they must be, first, workable and, secondly, defensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking not about an industry that can easily be replaced in some rural area, but about an industry that is fundamental to the well-being and economic support of large areas of the United Kingdom. If the industry is devastated, the effect on these areas will be equivalent to that of the clearances. That is what is happening. Large parts of our fishing fleets are being wiped out, but the Government are making no economic response and have no understanding of the social costs of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy about some of what has been said this morning. It is now clear where the Government stand, but is is also clear that we are at the beginning of the negotiation. I can find no leeway in the Government's position for them to be able to give way on something that would produce a workable agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have real concerns that many of the suggested monitoring measures are unworkable. It is all very well to say that one has the technical ability—the use of transponders and vast amounts of new a efficient equipment in fishing vessels—to monitor in the future. In reality, in an industry that is declining and in which people already have considerable difficulty in getting funding for new equipment and new boats, there will be no incentive whatsoever to invest in new means of technical monitoring.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
The Community will have to have a different and much more realistic attitude to the imposition of such measures. Long experience of sitting on the agriculture committee of the European Parliament proved to me conclusively that there is always a great feeling of community until matters come down to specifics. In this case, the specific is the defence of individual fishing fleets. If a Spanish fleet of 300 vessels can move into an area unmonitored, unchecked and cheating all the time, the effect on the fishing industry will be absolutely devastating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use the word "devastating" deliberately, and have used it more than once. We are talking about the future economic well-being of whole fishing, rural areas. I am appalled that we can look back over the past five years and see constant and perpetual change, with a clear arc of decline, for the fishing fleets. The interests of the customer and of those who represent rural areas must take precedence over the Foreign Office's negotiating procedures. There is a real fear that that will not be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.33 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister has realised that he has had an easier ride today than he has had during some of the other times when the Committee has met. That may be a reflection of the time that we were all up to last night or, more importantly, of the fact that there is considerable support on both sides of the Committee for the stance that he has taken. That shows that when the Government are working in harmony with the industry to achieve an objective, their position is always stronger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were allowed to vote in the Committee, which I am not, I could not go as far as to give a carte blanche endorsement to all the Government's fisheries policies. However, this is not the time, when the Minister has important negotiations ahead, to cast too much of a divisive note. He knows the issues on which we differ; we have explored them many times and I shall not rehearse them today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister had the support of the industry and both sides of the House of Commons when he took such a strong stand against the Commission's original proposals. They were unduly bureaucratic; they set precedents and opened the way for much more restrictive impositions on the industry; and they rang alarm bells on matters of enforcement. The Minister's position addresses those problems. We hope that opposing standard vessel days is seen as going hand in hand with the proposed legislation that is currently before the European Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there will be considerable negotiation, there is continuing concern in the industry that a mechanism might emerge that will give the Commission or our national Government the opportunity to screw down the industry further. There is also the worry that whatever emerges from these negotiations will be set as a precedent for the North sea. The Minister must proceed in his negotiations with considerable sensitivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Irish Box is being recognised for its importance not only as a sensitive area but because of the fishing activity that takes place. It is all very well giving enhanced protection to one area, but we know that fish are nomadic and there is no point in protecting one area when other areas open up so that the good done in one area can be undone by increased activity in the other. The Minister is aware that the approaches to the Irish Box are important too.

As I said, this is not the time to strike a discordant note and I wish the Minister and his colleague every success when they attend the Council meeting later this month.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I speak as a Member of Parliament who represents an important fishing area. It is interesting that the Minister has built better contacts with the Scottish Fishermen's Federation and other organisations—certainly more so than his predecessor. The people at the sharp front of an industry which is facing severe difficulties feel that they are being listened to and that the implications of those difficulties on communities are being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister should visit Lossiemouth and come to the Bunker, as we call the meeting place for skippers and crewmen, or visit Burghead where we have what is known as the "Parliament", to talk about the problems that many families face. Not only the skippers and crewmen are affected—there is a knock-on effect on families, communities, the processing industry and other industries that are dependent on the continuation of fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important aspects of the negotiations is the monitoring of how the Iberian fleet handles itself when it has access. I am extremely disappointed that full integration will go ahead in 1996 rather than 2002. That is a major error in the common fisheries policy and has added to the anxiety of fisheries communities. There is a desperate need to ensure equality of monitoring. Although I represent a north-east seat in Grampian region, many of my fishing constituents sail from the west of Scotland, particularly from Lochinver. They tell stories of Spanish and Portuguese fishermen being allowed to land catches which they themselves would not be allowed to land and for which they would be fined. That is extremely unfair. Without natural equality in monitoring the common fisheries policy, we shall never eradicate that sense of injustice felt by so many of our fishermen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Monro)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Lady would share with me a word of praise for the fisheries protection agency—our ships and aircraft, whose crews do a tremendously good job, especially in the northern waters. As the hon. Lady and I appreciate, it has had much success in arresting foreign vessels at sea and bringing them into harbour. Subsequently, there have been substantial fines in court. It is doing a good job, and doing what the hon. Lady wants it to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not criticise the fisheries protection agency or all those involved in it. However, a sense of injustice exists in the fishing fleet in Scotland and we must seriously tackle that issue. I wish the Minister well in trying to ensure that there is effective monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is about how the Iberian question ties in with what is happening in the Nordic communities. The referendum in Sweden on joining the European Union takes place on Remembrance Sunday and, in Norway, on 28 November. My current information is that in Sweden, it is very much icksy-picksy, as we say in Scotland; it is difficult to know how people will vote in the referendum, although the tendency suggests a narrow "Yes" majority.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
But it seems unlikely that Norway will give a "Yes" vote, although people are trying to persuade their regions otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may refer to what the Scottish Fishemen's Federation said in September this year in the context of the enlargement issues:
	<br><q><p>"we have been told that the decision to integrate the Iberian Countries ahead of the origial timescale was taken because of the imminent further Enlargement of the Community on 1 January 1995 and the consequent need to avoid a 'three-speed' Fisheries Policy and it has been said that there is some linkage between the approach to this review and the Accession negotiations which the Community conducted with Norway earlier this year. We do not know whether a hidden agenda of this kind existed at that time and, if so, whether it involved concessions to Spain/Portugal or to Norway, or indeed some kind of reciprocal arrangement."</p></q>
The Minister should tackle that point because, plainly, the Scottish Fishermen's Federation is deeply concerned that there has been not so much negotiations, but a trade-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the matter of effort limitation. Serious proposals have been put to the Minister by representatives of the fishing industry in Scotland, England and Wales and I hope that the Minister will take them fully into account. It is not my view that fishermen are out there simply to plunder stocks. Fishermen are deeply anxious to ensure the continuation of their industry. I see that, especially living in a fishing community where it is normal practice for sons to follow fathers and grandfathers into the fishing industry. They want to ensure that future generations in our areas will have a viable and profitable fishing industry. The serious proposals placed before the Minister merit serious consideration by the Government and also by the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, I return to the issue of decommissioning which is close to my heart as there are boatyards in my constituency. I believe that it is possible to have decommissioning and rebuild schemes at the same time which benefit the community. I urge the Minister to reconsider whether the decommissioning scheme could be expanded. The United Kingdom is at the bottom of the league in using access to European Union funds in that sphere of activity. Will the Minister also seriously examine the possibility of ensuring that any crewmen who lose their livelihoods as a result of decommissioning are considered for compensation? Unlike miners, for example, who are made redundant, crewmen are self-employed and have no access to redundancy money. It is important that money is spent not only for the skippers, but for the crewmen who daily risk their lives to bring catches to the shores.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have been on a Committee since you were elevated, Sir David, and I congratulate you on that.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the interest taken by Scottish Members of Parliament—not only those who represent fishing areas—and the work done by my fellow Members of Parliament of all parties who defend local interests. Everyone in Scotland has an interest in the fishing industry. I am from an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
industrial area. There is a dock in Grangemouth, but it is for containers. It is a long time since Bo'ness harbour has seen a fishing vessel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In containers, maybe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many things are contained in containers. It is important to restate the interest of Scottish Members of Parliament. There are many special Scottish circumstances which are often overlooked by the Government and especially by the European Union. It should be remembered that the fishing industry in Scotland was generated largely by people being driven out by the clearances from the land that they owned and farmed. They had to find a living so they took to the sea, with their eyes on the herring industry. Those people have shown tremendous entrepreneurial skill, but they feel that they have been repeatedly let down by the Government. The Government do their best in a poor set of circumstances, but they do not do as well as people in the fishing industry would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fishing industry in Scotland continues to argue against the Government's acceptance of days at sea as a means of regulating fishing. Special circumstances apply to the use of the standard vessel days in Scotland, especially because of the patterns of religious observance. The Government's explanatory document contains a strange proposal that captains would
	<br><q><p>"have to give 15 days' notice of the expected date on which they would utilise their allocation of fishing time and one day's notice of the date on which that allocation would be fully utilised."</p></q>
That is all very well if the weather is right or if boats are not deliberately tied up because of religious observance of weekends; It happens in Scotland that there is no fishing at sea on a Sunday. The proposal would work against the pattern of life of many Scottish fishing communities, as has been pointed out many times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the honourable Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) had been present at the beginning, he might have realised that the proposal to which he refers is not of the Government's making. It was the Commission's original proposal and I was strongly critical of many aspects of the standard vessel days. However, I welcome the honourable Gentleman's additional commments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the fact that I not in Committee earlier. As the honourable Member for Orkney and Shetland said, he kept us out of our beds until late last night with pointless voting patterns on strange conspiracy theories worked up by the leader of the Scottish National party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A strange alliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A strange alliance, indeed. Probably the only thing that the two parties agreed on was the fact that they did not know what they were talking about last night. We were all up rather late, which meant that I was unable to brief myself last night and had to do so this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the industry's preferences are much tighter than the Government's. The fact that the proposal from the European Union would not protect sensitive areas such as the western approaches to the Irish Box is of great concern to the Scottish fisheries industry. When the North sea is included following Norway's accession, which we all anticipate, there will be additional problems of incursions
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
into sensitive areas. The preference of the industry is for regulation through historic fishing rights rather than through a complex bureaucratic system set up by the European Union. I hope that the Government will take that into account. I am aware of all the other negotiations taking place around the fisheries negotiations. For our interests in Scotland, we want the fishing industry to be listened to more closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enforcement is an important matter. Some nations seem to be building vessels to breach European Union regulations—for example, vessels with special bulkheads so that extra fish can be stored in them. Those industries are deliberately changing their patterns of construction to flaunt the law and to break the rules and regulations. To introduce such vessels into our seas would be a great injustice, unless there is enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although hon. Members compliment the fisheries protection agency, I have heard from fishermen on the west coast that the areas covered by the fisheries protection vessels from their home ports do not suit the industry because travel times and so on are wrong. Perhaps rationalisation and the improved technical ability of those vessels are reasons for locations being changed. However, I am trying to take an interest in the industry, and fishermen tell me that they are not happy. They are doing a good job with what they have, but they do not necessarily have the resources that they want. Fishermen prefer simplicity and an end to the days-at-sea controls as a method of regulation. They want Spanish activity to be restricted—our fishermen are afraid of them—and they want the Irish Box to be retained and the western approaches to be protected. They want eventual protection for the North sea and for coastal protection to be undertaken by the coastal member states. We should listen to the industry, not because it cannot look after itself but because it is looking after the interests of the British people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Falkirk, East had been present at the start of our proceedings, he would have heard me recount that, on nearly all the issues that he has highlighted, our proposals were made because we listened to and worked closely with the industry. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and I have spent many hours in close contact with the Scottish fishing industry, listening to fishermen's views, keeping them informed and reflecting their concerns in our proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that the main stumbling block to the unanimity that he speaks of is that the Government still accept the days-at-sea regulation of the industry. Unless the Government change the regulations, they will never satisfy Scottish fishermen, and they will deeply offend people and let down the industry. The Minister says the he has agreement, but only as far as the Government are willing to go. If the Government showed steeliness and argued for and won the removal of the days-at-sea regulations, the fishing industry would give its full support. Until then, the industry will say that the Government, alhough not doing badly, are not doing well enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sebastian Coe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falmouth and Camborne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the remarks and resolve of my hon. Friend the Minister. He spoke about the simple logistics of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
enforcement and of a greater focus on technical considerations. I do not wish to be too parochial, but he knows that his resolve in those matters will determine the future of many Cornish fishermen. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich spoke eloquently about the difficulties of such communities in trying to find other sources of income. The Minister's resolve will determine the future of many Cornish families, not only in my constituency but in that of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris). Unfortunatley, my Learned Friend cannot be present this morning, as he is a doughty battler on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I unashamedly echo the sentiments that were expressed this morning. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that, if we reach an impasse, he will be under pressure from the Foreign and Comonwealth Office. He must maintain his resolve and present those views as more than a minor irritation in the larger debate for enlargement. There can be no capitulation. Historical access is sufficient reason to exclude the Spanish fleet from our coastal waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.54 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members have referred to the fears of local fishing communities. I wish to reinforce those views and to reiterate the concern that I expressed in previous debates on fishing issues. While the ministerial responsibility for such matters lies with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office, yet again there is no Welsh ministerial presence in the Committee during a fisheries debate. I hope that the Minister will emphasise to his colleagues the need for them to be present in such debates because the Welsh fishing industry is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears to which the hon. Member for Falkirk, East referred are justified. Over many years, we in Wales and the south-west have seen the effect on our communities of the Spanish fishing industry. It is flying under a flag of convenience which, at the moment, is a British flag of convenience. To all intents and purposes, however, it is a Spanish fishing fleet operated by a Spanish crew and, in the main, it is supplying the Spanish market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the problems that the Spanish fleet has caused to our indigenous industry, especially on the shore. One statistic was that for every fisherman at sea, 10 people were employed on shore. Unfortunately, since the Spanish-flagged ship has come in, significant amounts of the British quota have been removed from the Irish sea and the souths western approaches and taken directly to Spanish markets. There is no added value to fish caught off the British quota, but by the Spanish-flagged ships. That is adding to our unemployment problems in the south-west of England and west Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from direct experience the problems that are caused by the Spanish fishing industry. I know that the Minister appreciates the fears of fishermen. Those who have fished traditionally in the Irish Box recognise what is likely to happen if, after 1 January 1996, the Spanish gain full access to that area. I have no criticism to make of the fisheries protection fleet and the work that it does. But given the number of boats caught breaking the law, it seems that the present arrangements are no deterrent to illegal fishing. If they were, the efficient fisheries protection fleet would not catch so many people breaking the law. That is why I asked about monitoring and whether there would be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
an increase in the effort of the British Government and, ideally, the European Union to strengthen the deterrent effect by literally putting more boats at sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the point about satellite location. It is an important issue, but we still need fishery protection vessels at sea, constantly monitoring and checking the position. As a result, fleets of all nations will know that in areas around the British coast, there will be no escape and that they will be checked and prosecuted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prosecution is important, especially in relation to deterrence. I congratulate magistrates who have now begun to remove fishing licences from vessels. Unfortunately, they can remove fishing licences only from British vessels. Such action was taken by Falmouth magistrates court against a vessel that was Spanish operated, but a British-flagged ship. Perhaps the Minister could take back to the Fisheries Council the idea that if a vessel of whatever flag or nationality is found blatantly breaching European Union law on fishing—whether in connection with secret holds or mesh size—its licence is removed. It is no good us depending on the courage and resolve of British magistrates. We want prosecutions to take place in Spain, France, Belgium, the Netherland, or wherever. The Minister would receive unanimous support if he made that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain extremely pessimistic about the outcome of the negotiations. We know from experience how attractive the Irish Box is to Spanish fishing interests. That is why they have invested so much time and money in fighting their case to get on to the British register. They want to get into the Irish Box as soon as possible. I fear that while there is majority voting on this issue, the Spanish will muster sufficient support from other nations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason is the Government's record on the multi-annual guidance programme. We cannot say to other nations in the European Union, "We've been doing everything to conserve fishing stocks." European document 7541/94 presents the annual report to the Council and the Parliament on the effectiveness of our record on MAGP and the reduction of fishing effort. During the three-year intermediate period, Belgium achieved a 12 per cent. cut in power, Denmark is already exceeding its target, Germany met its objectives, France met its tonnage criteria and did not quite meet its power criteria, Greece met both tonnage and power requirements, Spain met its objectives and Portugal was well within its target. But at page 10, the report says:
	<br><q><p>"The set of figures most favourable to British interests (those of the fleet register) nonetheless show that this country was significantly outside the intermediate objectives for 1993."</p></q>
With that record, can we tell our European partners that Britain has done its best in terms of reducing fishing effort and conservation? Spain and Portugal—the states seeking entry to the Irish Box and elsewhere—have met the MAGP guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remain pessimistic. I appreciate the work that the Minister has done, particularly in his discussions with the industry. I hope that he will be successful but, sadly, I do not believe that he will gain everything that we need to protect our fishing industry all around the British coast and especially on the west and south-west coast. Irish fishing interests share those fears. I hope that I am wrong and that my pessimism is not well founded, but from what we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
seen during the past. 10 years, if the Spanish industry gets access to the Irish Box, that will virtually spell the end of the Welsh and south-western fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a helpful debate. I assure all hon. Members who have contributed to it that I shall carefully consider what they have said. Their unanimity of support for our negotiating position is very helpful because it will enable my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and I, who will attend the Council, to point out that when our Parliament considered the matter, whatever differences there may be between us on United Kingdom fisheries policy, there was no difference in our wish to see the interest of Britain's industry defended in the negotiations. In the days to come, if members of the Committee who have contacts with European Members of Parliament wish to add their weight of support, I should be happy to brief them in more detail if that will enable them to influence the outcome. The more people who shout our message the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The common theme that must be underlined is enforcement. I refer to the remarks of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. I do not pray in aid high technology as the total solution to any problem. It is very expensive and untested as a provable, reliable system. I have said that we have pressed enforcement extremely hard in the Fisheries Council and I take the matter seriously. I pointed out that, with the advent of the control regulation, trial satellite monitoring is now being taken more seriously at Community level. Anecdotal reports by television presenters, programmes, and industry representations to ports in northern Spain, which bring back stories about prosecutions, as referred to by the hon. Member for Pembroke, build the picture that not everybody plays by the rules. It is worth reflecting that not every fisherman in every member state plays by the rules. If we are to have strength to our elbow on this argument, United Kingdom fishermen must reflect on that matter. The fewer prosecutions we have the whiter the picture we can paint of our position. I assure the Committee that the enforceability of future policies will be uppermost in our minds. On deploying resources on protection and enforcement, we shall examine current patterns carefully in the light of new regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a second theme in our debate involving some criticism about the multi-annual guidance programme. With regard to the comments of the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe about what we are trying to do to meet our target, on the subject of nephrops—trawls and shellfish mobiles—we are presently negotiating with the Commission for reductions in our sectoral target. We are reflecting the technical nature of those fisheries, which is a way into the arguments on technical conservation. I am optimistic that we shall achieve an allowance that we can post against our target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also seriously considering improving the way in which licence aggregation works. What set out to be a promising source of a reduction in effort has not been taken up by the industry with quite the enthusiasm for which I had hoped. In discussions, representatives of the industry have given me the idea that by making some adjustments, which we shall discuss with the industry, there may be opportunities to see two objectives realised. There could be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
a reduction in effort and some modernisation. It is interesting to note that, despite some of the gloomier statements about the industry, this year there have been orders in Scotland for 15 new fishing vessels. I was pleased to note that some are to be built in Scottish yards. So, perhaps the picture is not quite as bad as it is always painted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Comments were made about the attitude of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In its defence, in the enlargement negotiations it was anxious to ensure that fisheries issues were given proper weight. The fact that we gained extra fish in the discussions on cohesion cod and fishing in north Norway underscores its importance. However, I shall draw the attention of my colleagues in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to hon. Members' remarks on those important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that hon. Members have acknowledged the difficulties of the negotiations on which we are about to embark. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich chastised me about our regard—according to her interpretation—for the scrutiny process. I take such matters extremely seriously. Had the Commission not been tardy in keeping to its original timetable, we would not have had to put a presumptive motion before the House. I understand the line she has taken, but I write to the Chairman of the Scrutiny Committee to keep him posted as regularly as I can. In a fast-moving situation, it is not always possible for official papers to catch up with real world events.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I was not targeting him in particular, as I hope he understands. If the Government find it impossible to operate existing machinery, it is important for Ministers to make that clear to the House authorities so that we can consider alternative methods. The Minister will be aware that the Danish, for example, operate a much more brutal and effective method of controlling their Parliament and insist on it being adhered to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. However, we face some timetabling difficulties; this year, there are German elections and the German presidency. The Fisheries Council was, therefore, moved from October to September. However much one brutalises Parliament—as the hon. Lady suggested—it might not always be possible to have a confluence of events to enable our Parliament to have an advance say on such matters. Ministers try hard to keep all parties informed, officially or through unofficial networks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich said that we must not be sidelined in the negotiations; she emphasises, with her long experience of such matters, an important point. I hope that everyone who reads the report of the Committee will reflect on it. If I do not engage in negotiations on behalf of the United Kingdom, we shall be sidelined. People have often said, "Can you just say no?" If I do that, I will be out; I will not be part of the negotiating process. I do not underestimate the problems that we shall face, but I shall not be sidelined. The fact that I am engaging in a broad range of bilateral discussions with fellow fisheries Ministers demonstrates my intention to put forward the UK's position in clear, unequivocal terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and I will do our best, but we shall be engaged in negotiation. Our starting point accords with the industry's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
view. As the hon. Member for Falkirk, East remarked, we have tried hard to say in touch with the industry on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noted other points raised by hon. Members and I assure them that I shall reflect on them carefully when considering the line to take in the Fisheries Council. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Coe) used a telling phrase when he said that this matter was not a minor irritation. He was right to emphasise that. He and my hon. Friends the Members for Scarborough and for St. Ives have been doughty defenders of the industry in putting forward its case. We shall do that as vigorously as possible in forthcoming negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee, given those explanations, will endorse the motion and send me into the negotiations with unanimous support; that would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
