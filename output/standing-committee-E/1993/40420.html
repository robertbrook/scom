	<div class='legislation'>Market in Raw Tobacco</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call the Minister to make his opening statement, which I trust will be relatively brief. After that there is time for questions. Together, questions and the statement can last for up to one hour, after which I shall call the Minister again to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall indeed be relatively brief, Mr. Winterton, but this is a complex subject and I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the Committee the Court of Auditors report on the tobacco regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all the common agricultural policy regimes, the tobacco regime has rightly attracted the most criticism and the deepest frustration at the huge sums of money involved. The report pulls no punches in confirming that the regime has been the subject of fraud, irregularities and maladministration. It cries out for reform. The United Kingdom has played a leading role in maintaining the pressure for such reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime began in 1970 when the Common Market organisation, meeting the objectives of the EEC treaty, was introduced, bringing together the national market systems of the then producer member states and recognising GATT obligations with respect to tariff levels. With the accession of the new member states, particularly Greece, the costs, complications and problems of the regime grew. Today, seven of the 12 member states produce some form of tobacco, but the Community's consumption tastes dictate that it must import two thirds of its requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime's principal aims were to support production in disadvantaged farming areas where there are few if any alternative crops and work opportunities, to maintain farmers' incomes and to reduce unwanted surpluses by adapting production to the varieties in demand. In practice, the regime led to significant overproduction of unwanted varieties and escalating expenditure to finance intervention and export subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regime became the 10th most costly, accounting for just under four per cent. of CAP expenditure, but it is the most costly in terms of support per hectare. In 1994 it is likely to cost more than 1·2 becu—about £930 million. That is too much and it is unacceptable to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there were adjustments to the regime in the 1980s, a complete reform was not agreed until 1992. The reform has several implications, from the 1993 harvest onwards. Production subsidies will be limited—the tonnage of 370,000 will be reduced to 350,000 from 1994. More marketable varieties will be encouraged. Intervention and export refunds have been withdrawn, although they could be reinforced in exceptional circumstances. The main producer states have had to establish control agencies to oversee the scheme. The Committee might like to know that similar agencies established for olive oil are already
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
showing results. Last year, Italy reported more than 336 cases of irregularities—a more than threefold increase in the level of reporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission estimates that by 1997 expenditure should have been cut by 25 per cent. as a result of the reform. That is a step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have before them copies of the Court of Auditors report, and they will see that it relates to the period before the reforms. It makes horrifying reading, but the regime has been significantly changed since then, so the Commission has correctly argued that many of the criticisms levelled by the report have already been met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report centres on the budgetary and financial aspects of the regime and draws attention to a considerable, but unspecified, sum of Community funds that may have been paid out incorrectly or without adequate safeguard under the old regime, the Commission is investigating those claims, with a view to making arrangements for necessary recoveries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government strongly support the work of the auditors in highlighting such instances of poor financial management or control, and we therefore stress the importance of Commission and member state cooperation. Furthermore, we will seek to ensure that all these investigations are concluded speedily and effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report demonstrates the importance that the Government attach to improving and tightening controls on fraud. It is worth stating that, as a result of the Maastricht treaty arrangements, there is now a comprehensive financial management framework, which includes an explicit requirement for member states to treat fraud perpetrated against Community budgets as vigorously as fraud against national budgets. That framework also requires the European Court of Auditors to provide a statement of assurance on the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. That independent assessment of the Community accounts should identify any problem and enable the Government to press for urgent, remedial action. Under our presidency, we pressed for a refinement in the approach to fraud, especially in risk analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report focuses on some of the broader principles and it shows the large amount of CAP support per hectare for tobacco. We agree that that support is well out of line with subsidies for other crops and that it should be reformed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that the tobacco regime provides a form of income support and employment in isolated areas with very small holdings and few, if any, alternative crop opportunities. But the support is 23 times per hectare that given to cereal production, which is not acceptable or justifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report draws attention to the apparent anomaly of supporting both tobacco production and anti-smoking initiatives, but with annual Community consumption running at 670,000 tonnes, over two thirds of which is imported, stopping support to tobacco producers will not, in itself, deal with smoking problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government broadly support the Court's conclusions on those issues. We have always been highly critical of the tobacco regime. Indeed, it was largely because of our efforts—with little support from other member states—that the 1992 reforms were achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
More can be done to improve the regime. There is a Council commitment for review in 1996. But I am sure that the Committee will agree that the report provides an important channel to stimulate work, as the interim focus for the development of future reforms of the regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our policy will be to continue to press for further fundamental reform, especially the reductions in support to which the general criticisms of the report point. The report is a way of putting further pressure on the Commission and other member states. But I do not want to leave the Committee in any doubt about the difficulty of that task, as other member states are not as keen as we are to change the regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall closely monitor the effectiveness of the new regime, but that will not dissuade us from our efforts to continue to press for further reductions in the amount of budgetary support and to ensure that the new regime is effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call members of the Committee to put their questions, I shall give them some guidance. Having studied the document and sought advice, I should point out that all aspects of Community support for tobacco production, including the social and health costs and tax revenue implications, will be appropriate matters for both question and debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee is aware that the Select Committee on European Legislation has suggested five issues that this Committee might explore: the use of such large European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Funds in support of Community tobacco production; the extent to which the control problems associated with the old tobacco regime have been rectified in the new regime; whether an alternative system based on direct income support would be preferable and workable; the possible health costs associated with Community support for tobacco production; and the tax revenue implications of any change in approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that provides a guide to members of the Committee on the wide nature of the subjects that can be tackled in this morning's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What measures is the Minister taking specific to the tobacco market, to recover sums lost as a result of irregularities or negligence, which member states are required to do under article 8 of Council regulation 727/70? Can he tell us how many people have been prosecuted, why the report was not immediately made public, and what measures he is taking to make future investigations immediate and public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have five minutes, Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I can keep going for one minute without interruption or repetition, I shall be doing extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady posed the question, with her usual forthrightness, as if I was entirely responsible for running the regime. If the regime were run by the United Kingdom Government, we would not be having this debate. We are aware of some of the deficiencies on fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about recovery. One of the frustrations that I encountered when reading the Court of Auditors report was that, in the Commission's response to it, there was no detail of the amount of money estimated to have been fraudulently acquired by the failings of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
regime, or of exactly what would be done to recover it. There is talk about quantifying the amount and about looking at the accounts for 1990–91. Nobody could be left in any doubt that there is a lot of looking going on, so I agree with the specific criticism that the Commission is reluctant to come forward with specific thoughts about how much money will be recovered or when or how that will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are acting robustly. Where we recognise that the Commission has gone wobbly over recovery of moneys, for example in connection with Italian milk quotas, the United Kingdom Government are taking the Commission to the European Court to press it to stick to its original figures. We shall monitor carefully what the Commission does and we shall consider what line to take if we do not receive specific answers to precisely the type of question being asked by the hon. Lady—we are asking them too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also asked the Minister what he was going to do about explaining why the report was not immediately made public to member states. I remind him that although he claims not to be responsible, he is one of the responsible Ministers. I quoted the Council regulations under which he specifically, as part of the Council of ministers, is responsible. Will he tell us why the report was not made public, why the commission did not help, why, in spite of the constant questioning by the Court of Auditors, more action has not been taken, and why there is no clear intention to bring individuals to account? The report is a disgrace. What are the Government doing about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I told the hon. Lady, we have pressed hard for the information to be made available. If she has read the Court of Auditors report in detail, as she clearly has, she will note the frustration of the Court of Auditors in getting the Commission to respond to its inquiries. That is the source of delay—the Commission was reluctant, as I read it, to co-operate with the Court of Auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have pressed hard for the information to be made available. The whole of our action during our presidency was to raise the profile of anti-fraud activity in the Community. I had hoped that the hon. Lady might give some praise to the Government for having been one of the leading lights in getting such information released. There has been deep frustration. Some people have highlighted to me their concern about how Commission officials have been treated. There has been delay throughout, We have pressed for action but there has been a reluctance by the Commission to come clean. The report is now in the public domain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trying to follow the report, it seems to me that the amount of support being given to tobacco growers increased from about £2 million when it first started to £200 million over a 12-year period. During the following 13 years, it rose to almost £1 billion, so it has more than quadrupled. Have any estimates been made about how much money is likely to be spent over the next five years if those trends are allowed to continue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley, a near neighbour of mine, for his important question. The Commission estimates that the changes in the regime should save about 25 per cent of current expenditure. But even that leaves the rate of subsidy per hactare for tobacco growers at an unacceptably high level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has accepted that, as a member of the Council of Ministers, the Commissioner is responsible to the Council, and that he must therefore take a certain amount of responsibility for the changes that the Opposition favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reform was introduced in 1992 which dealt with such wide-ranging abuses of the system. What measures have been introduced since 1992 to evaluate those reforms and ensure that they are having the desired effect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister referred to the apparent lack of co-operation on the part of the Commission. Indeed, the report of the Court of Auditors suggested that there was fraud in the Commission and that one high-ranking member of the Commission was involved in that fraud. I noticed that the report said that the member concerned died during the investigation, and there is some suggestion that the investigation ended on his death. Is that true; and can the Minister tell the Committee whether the member died from natural causes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think he died from hitting the ground hard when he jumped out of a window. I leave the hon. Gentleman to draw his own conclusions from that sad event. The short answer is that there has not been a full investigation into the matter. Pressure is being applied to the Commission to consider that. Whatever the situation, it is regrettable that there has not been full public disclosure. I am sorry that I cannot help the hon. Gentleman further with that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what measures had been introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of the regime. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, similar fraudulent activity was highlighted in the olive oil regime and new control agencies, which were instituted to ensure that the new regime was effectively applied seem to have begun to concentrate minds. As I said, there has been a threefold increase in the irregularities reported under the olive oil regime as a result of the new techniques. Those are tangible results of practical effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have attached particular importance to the work of the Court of Auditors. The manpower available for such work has been increased, there is criticism that the Commission has not fully used that extra manpower to staff the anti-fraud unit, but more resources are being made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the fact that auditors are giving anti-fraud work equal status with similar work in member states means that the work of the Court of Auditors will take on greater importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the role of the European Parliament should not be ignored. It is involved in the qualification of accounts and it take careful note of the work of the Court of Auditors. Therefore, in terms of effectiveness, member states are putting greater pressure on the Commission, the role of the Court of Auditors has been enhanced, there is evidence that the control regime is effective, and there is the watching brief of the European Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that some matters contained in the report had already been dealt with by the European Community and that the Council was committed to review the whole market in raw tobacco in 1996. Does that mean that the report was discussed by the Council of Ministers before it was scrutinised by member states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is no. The Court of Auditors report does not go to the European Council for discussion. Alterations to the regime have been dealt with through the usual channel of the Agriculture Council, and any changes for 1996 are yet to be formulated and discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many members of the public will be scratching their heads and wondering why, when the Government have mounted a successful campaign to persuade people not to smoke and to inform them of the dangers of smoking, the European Community is spending £930 million to subsidise tobacco growing in the Community. Will the Minister shed some light on that? I see from the report that the major producers are Germany, Greece, Spain, France and Italy. Is there pressure on other members of the European Community to support the subsidy on tobacco, in return for subsidies on other crops in their states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the last point, I do not know what goes on between member states when they speak one to another to obtain support for parts of the agricultural regime that are important to them. I was left scratching my head to discover that, while there is pressure on people to dissuade them from smoking, we have an inordinately expensive regime to produce tobacco in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Council regulation No. 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 details the reforms of the common market in raw tobacco. I remind the hon. Gentleman of one of the "whereas" clauses which gives a clue as to how we got into this situation:
	<br><q><p>"Whereas it is the purpose of the common agricultural policy to achieve the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty, and, in particular in the raw tobacco sector, the stabilization of markets and a fair standard of living for the agricultural population concerned; whereas these objectives may be achieved by adapting resources to requirements, in particular by means of a quality policy."</p></q>
Article 39 of the treaty of Rome refers to providing income for rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Community came into existence, four of the six original members produced tobacco. It has been described as an allotment industry. Tobacco is grown on holdings that are usually less than 1 hectare in size. There are 200,000 growers in parts of the Community where it is difficult to see what alternative crops could be grown commercially to provide a living. As the Community seeks to harmonise that which is there, it invented a tobacco regime as part of the common agricultural policy, and tobacco is a legitimate agricultural crop. As the Community has enlarged, the regime has been built on; and now even Belgium and Germany, as well as hot countries such as Greece and Italy, have a small amount of tobacco production. Difficult rural areas are involved and that support has been maintained. We played a leading role in challenging what is clearly outrageous expenditure of public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know that the 	<i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> stated on 2 March 1994, under the heading
	<br><q><p>"Examination of the Accounts and of the Underlying Transactions in the Member States",</p></q>
that the payment for tobacco is not finalised
	<br><q><p>"until adoption of the decision on the clearance of accounts for the year during which the payments took place."</p></q>
Will the Minister assure us that he knows exactly how much money was lost to public funds because of fraud in the tobacco market? Will he tell us how that was calculated and how accurate his calculations are; and will he state
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
specifically what he intends to do to ensure that the Court of Auditors report is published early enough to enable Members of Parliament to discuss it and to ask for the answers that he seems unable to provide this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to demonstrate to the hon. Lady what she may perceive as a further inadequacy. She asked if I knew exactly how much money was lost. I hoped that I had made it clear, as the Commission has, that it is still trying to work out precisely how much money has been lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady will be aware that the European Parliament is asking some searching questions on the clearance of accounts. That is one area in which we are pushing the Commission to come to conclusions. The United Kingdom has been in the lead in pushing for accurate fraud prevention and discovery work, but fraud is like other crime in that we know only that which has been discovered or reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot tell the hon. Lady exactly how much money has been lost. The report identifies several serious fraudulent activities, but it may not represent the totality, so I cannot tell the hon. Lady the exact figures because that information is not in the public domain. The Commission has not made it available, but we are pressing for it. For obvious reasons, I wish that I could be specific because I should be delighted to know the exact size of the problem, but there has been reluctance in the European Community to take such fraud matters seriously. At least the Government have played a leading part in putting the matter well and truly on the agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission dictates its own timetable and it was clearly reluctant to provide information to the Court of Auditors to enable a timely publication of the findings. If there is a problem, I shall look at it, but I believe that we have brought the matter forward as quickly as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister. This issue is a good example of the European Community at its worst, and I am extremely alarmed to discover the anticipated level of fraud. Goodness knows how farmers in my constituency will view the matter when they cannot even get details of the linseed oil scheme before they begin their planting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the unknown quantities of money involved and the extent of the fraud, will the Minister assure us that he will not allow the Commission to shilly-shally and delay until a full investigation is completed? As and when cases of fraud are identified, the Commission must seek reimbursement as soon as possible—immediately in some cases—rather than delay until its investigations have gone to the nth degree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that we shall robustly press the Commission once the precise sums have been identified. We have, at some discomfort to the United Kingdom, taken the Commission to the European Court over its reluctance to recover money connected with the misintroduction of the milk quota scheme in Italy.

Much as we all condemn fraud, it is important to recognise that, since it is a criminal activity, one must have precise proof that it has taken place and investigations therefore sometimes take time. It is clear from the report that some remarkably collusive activities have been going on in various member states over the operation of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
regime. The partners involved make the chain of command difficult to unravel, so that is hard to put one's finger on who was involved in the fraudulent activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend has read some of the remarkable stories of the findings of the Court of Auditors. That body, which has uncovered the fraud, must be given due time for its investigations. We are raising the status of fraud investigation, ensuring that it is properly resourced, and applying pressure to ensure that such matters are brought out into the open as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is Andorra included in the tobacco support regime? The Minister may know of the longstanding practice, which is almost a type of fraud, of growing tobacco in poor alpine fields and then destroying the tobacco in the principality to allow an equivalent amount of tobacco to be imported and sold at duty-free rates. Are the people in Andorra entitled to any support from the EC regime; and can the Minister tell us whether any member of the Commission has been suspended, disciplined or dismissed as a result of this damning report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the Andorra question is no. There have been many rumours—people have probably seen so much tobacco smoke of inappropriate varieties being burnt in Andorra, and drifting into Community countries that they imagine that it has something to do with the Community's regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government in Andorra run their own support policy and produce 940 tonnes of what is described as rather low-quality black or Gauloise-type tobacco a year. In order to raise the standards of that product, the Government allow manufacturers to import tobacco for blending, provided they destroy an equivalent amount of home-produced Andorran tobacco. Beware of going to Andorra and buying its cigarettes—they do not sound too good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about suspension. I am sorry, but I cannot give him an answer about that. I will look into the matter and if there are facts to report, I will write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note from the 11th report of the Select Committee dealing with the report on raw tobacco that there are concerns, and that one of them is about the system to deal with the varieties which are produced, and the quality. It states that there has "largely been a failure". Does the Minister intend to press, quite sensibly, for the ceasing of growing of what is basically an inadequate product? If any of my farmers in the National Farmers Union for Scotland produced low-quality beef, low-quality lambs or low-quality cereal, those products would simply not be purchased. Strictly quality regimes exist here. What do our Government intend to do to press for quality? If the product is not good enough for use in the European Community, why are they being allowed to grow it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts his finger on an important point. The Court of Auditors report suggests very clearly that, for example, some of the testing on moisture content of the tobacco leaf, which is a key part in determining quality standards, was hopelessly applied in many of the regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1992 reforms limited complexity of 34 different varieties to—[	<i>Interruptions.</i>]—eight varieties. It is nice to be given information by osmosis, although I particularly focused on this point, having read the report. The 34 varieties have been reduced to eight; and within that, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
varieties are banded together; There are differentials to try to encourage the production of varieties which are wanted. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the Community still consumes 670,000 tonnes of tobacco two thirds of which are imported. That underlines precisely the point made by the hon. Gentleman. We may well want further reform of the regime, as it appears rather odd to lay people as well as to hon. Members, that the production of unwanted items should be encouraged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Ms. Gillan) said that her agricultural producers will be quite angry to read how much money is being given to tobacco growers in the European Community, so will my farmers in the Ribble Valley be. Some of them have to rely on subsidies from the European Community to ensure that they are able to keep sheep on areas where they otherwise could not. As 75 per cent. of my constituency is an area of outstanding natural beauty, were any of those subsidies to be reduced, as they have been during the past year or so, one might find that the "natural beauty" which many people—especially those from urban areas,—tend to enjoy, was being destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report shows that Italy and Spain have been caught with their hands in the till, receiving money from the European Community and, in particular, ingnoring quotas, for which they have been rightly fined. Is there any evidence to show that some of the money has been paid fraudulently to organised or disorganised crime in those two countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall send the hon. Gentleman the latest data on income from Community payments, such as sheep annual premium, to convince him that things are not quite so difficult as he may think, although no one would want to underestimate the pressure on hill farmers. Like any other taxpayer, hill farmers want to be certain that appropriate budgetary controls are in place to ensure that large amounts of Community funding are allocated properly, which is the theme of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether organised crime is involved. There is evidence of crime, but I do not know how organised it is. I direct him to the sections on the Italian regime, especially as it applies to southern Italy, and ask him to draw his own conclusions. The report refers to criminal and fraudulent activity. I cannot comment specifically on whether cases have been brought locally because of such activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Council of Ministers has made some decisions that relate to the report. Was it aware of the report's existence when the decisions were made? When will the document be discussed formally within the Council of Ministers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ministers would have been aware of the fraudulent activities in the tobacco regime and the need for reform, but when the matter was discussed in the Agriculture Council I think that Ministers would not have had the document. A document will not be tabled at a Council meeting unless someone specifically asks for it to be put on the agenda. Reports are produced by the Court of Auditors and it is up to the Commission to respond to them. If issues emerge from such reports—for example, the requirement for the Commission to provide information—the Council of Ministers can discuss them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To turn to a different point, page ix of the Select Committee's 11th report states:
	<br><q><p>"tender sales for intervention had been organised in such a way as to encourage the operation of cartels and the abuse of the system".</p></q>
Section 1.12 of the report states:
	<br><q><p>"under the new regime, primia are paid as soon as the tobacco is delivered to the processor".</p></q>
In most of the frauds, the same product—either fictitious, or existing—is counted and paid for several times. Might it be more effective if processors, which tend to be large companies, were made responsible for the veracity of any payment plan? Will such an arrangement be adopted? Are the financial penalties large enough to make large, international processors afraid of becoming involved in any corruption, thereby, in a sense, policing the producers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the things that struck me when I read some of the detailed, almost anecdotal reports of the auditors was the way in which processors manipulated green currency rates under the old regime by taking in tobacco and waiting some time before claiming premiums. It was interesting to see how people had played the green currency market to try to maximise returns. The new regime has a series of interlocking checks. As there is a contract with a grower or producer organisation to produce a quantity of tobacco, which includes payment at the first point of contact with the producer, there is a link between the quantity that should be produced and the quantity received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind the complexity of the tobacco process and, as the report said, the way in which varieties, remarkably, change on pieces of paper, getting it right at the first point, when input and receipt can be tied together, seems to be a way of clearly relating the amount of money involved to the amount of a particular type of tobacco. By restricting the different varieties from 34 to eight, we shall relieve complexity. Simple systems that can be scrutinised closely are the essence of fraud control. As we have seen with the olive oil regime, the new regime will ensure that more irregularities will be reported, if identified, although no one imagines that changing the rules will guarantee a perfect system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the level of fines that can be applied? Has any change been made to the fines, and are they considered adequate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that important point. On the question of fines, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) spoke about the need to identify the fraud—where it occurred and how much money was involved. We are still pressing to obtain that information because the first point of recovery will be from the state. If an organisation has indulged in fraudulent activity, it is for the member state to take action through its national law. There is now a requirement to give as much priority to fraud perpetrated against a Community regime as to national fraud. I regret that I am unable to tell the hon. Gentleman whether any cases relating to tobacco have been taken up as a direct result, but I shall look into that and supply the hon. Gentleman with any information I find.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to World Health Organisation statistics, 431,000 people die each year as a result of tobacco-related illnesses. That is a staggering figure. One quarter of all deaths in middle age can be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
attributed to tobacco products. I find it morally repugnant that so much European taxpayers' money is diverted into subsidising tobacco growing. Is there a real political will in the European Community to tackle the problem so that, over the years, subsidies will not only be reduced, but ended altogether?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there was a problem with diversification and I know that 200,000 people are involved in growing tobacco in the European Community. But just as in other parts of the European Community industry has had to be restructured over the years because of changing trends, could not a similar programme for tobacco be introduced in the Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would certainly be interesting to juxtapose in debate issues of health and agriculture. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that 1 per cent. of the premiums allocated goes towards research and development to improve our knowledge of the harmful effects of tobacco on the young and to steer the production of tobacco into less harmful varieties. So a penalty, albeit a limited one, is applied to the sums involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of reform, my hon. Friend highlighted an interesting area of activity. The Court of Auditors report included some discussion of whether an income support scheme should be introduced to assist growers to move away from their present activities. We support that possibility being investigated more closely. The alternatives are different crops, but I have seen the list of possible crops that will grow in the relevant areas and hardly any of them are without their own difficulties, or are already in surplus in the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be a seductive way out of the problem, but it does not represent a long-term future. We are mindful of the need to consider an alternative strategy, but it is easy to say in this Room, where the Committee is unanimous in its annoyance at the amount of money involved, that we want to change the system. The member states which must answer to their constituents are heavily wedded to the regime. It has been a long, uphill struggle to get it changed, but we shall not demur from pressing for further reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there a procedure by which a member state can arrange to have the report discussed by the Council of Ministers or the Commission? If such a procedure exists, why do we not pursue it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such a procedure exists under the discharge procedure for the Community's accounts. The current treaty provides for the Council of Ministers to consider relevant special reports. If effective action is not taken on the tobacco report, we shall press for that mechanism to be used and for a Council discussion. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of the four countries that will hopefully accede to the European Community—Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway—are any tobacco growers and, if so, what impact will that have on the budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not have believed it unless I had ferreted out the information, but in its entry negotiations clean-living Austria received an allocation of 600 tonnes. It came as a surprise to me that any tobacco was grown in Austria, which is an environmentally sensitive country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that at last we have turned to the health aspects. Whatever crops are grown, we want that to be done as efficiently and productively as possible. We would all prefer a European Community that did not grow a crop that is as harmful as tobacco, which is a drug. As I walk from the Elephant and Castle to the House every morning I see people dragging on cigarettes with their eyes bulging, desperate for the drug. That makes me think how crazy we are to subsidise it to the extent of £1 billion. Paragraph 1.8 of the 11th Report states that only £1.2 million is allocated to the action fund for tobacco smoking prevention, yet—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is question time, not speech time. Will the hon. Gentleman please ask his question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Winterton. I intend to keep in order, but the subject is difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Government have a view on such waste? I wonder how forcefully they intend to argue against this ridiculous regime. We have heard what the Minister said about replacement crops, but surely it would be worth £1 billion to stop people dealing in this product of death.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is anything between us on this. In the "Health of the Nation" report, the Government signalled clearly to the public the dangers of smoking. The United Kingdom has been in the lead in pressing for reform of the tobacco regime. It seems almost as if double standards are being applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems of dealing with the Conmmunity is that, much as we fulminate and press for change, member states such as Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and France are involved in the tobacco regime. They are defending the interests of 200,000 families in very poor agricultural areas of the Community. As I said a moment ago to my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) we do not oppose looking into the alternative of a system of income support for such individuals. Many people find smoking repugnant and scratch their heads over why, at a time when the health connotations are clearly understood, the Community is subsidising such production. Some feel strongly about obesity and would query Community sugar regimes. Agricultural products have many health connotations, although tobacco is different from some of the other issues because people die as a result of smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have convinced the hon. Gentleman. I emphasise yet again our commitment to further reforms to the regime and further reductions in expenditure. The reforms that have been achieved so far are dedicated to reducing expenditure by 25 per cent. and we shall not hesitate to press for further reforms, but it is important that like-minded politicians in Europe feel the same and influence their Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased to hear that I have a specific question, Mr. Winterton. What are the anticipated production targets in the European Community for each of the eight varieties and in total? Will there be an increase or a decrease? What are the Government doing to press for a decrease in the quantity of tobacco grown?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the exact quantities of each of the eight varieties, but under the new regime the quantity of tobacco produced will drop from 390,000 tonnes to 350,000, which is a substantial reduction.

Premiums will not be paid for tobacco produced over quota, and the intervention and export subsidy schemes have ended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have recently returned from Malawi, which is one of the poorest African countries, where tobacco is an important crop. I had never witnessed such poverty. The people live in mud huts. I had never seen anything like it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is very interesting, but may we have a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Relatively well-off producers in the European Community are being subsidised to the tune of £1 billion. What impact is that having on third world and developing countries, which rely on tobacco exports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a genuinely difficult question to answer. The simple answer is that under the new regime there are no longer any export subsidies for tobacco sent outside the European Union. The world tobacco market is complicated. There are 33 million people around the world involved in some way, shape or form in growing tobacco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appeared to be a demand for cheaper, poorer quality tobacco in some of the growing markets. Some of the varieties produced in Europe were able to meet that demand, but that is no longer being encouraged by export subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the problem with the Commission? Why did it drag its feet on responding? Why are its responses rather complacent, given the seriousness of the points made in the report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pose that question to myself. The tenor of the Commission's response appeared to downplay some of the findings, compared with the strength of the views expressed by the Court of Auditors. I do nor know why the Commission appeared reluctant to fall more forcefully in line with the view of the Court of Auditors. There will always be differences of perception on such matters. Clearly, much was uncovered that the Commission had to investigate, and presumably that is what delayed its response to the document. As a result of our activities on fraud and of the actions that will be taken by the European Parliament, greater pressure will be put on the Commission in relation to the discharge of accounts. Otherwise, to put it in simple terms, the Commission's accounts will not be discharged and it would find that rather hard to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 4311/94 relating to European Court of Auditors Special Report No. 8/93 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco; and strongly supports the Government's policy to continue to press for further reform of the tobacco regime and for appropriate measures to be taken to prevent fraud.</p></q>
The discussions proved a unanimity among members of the Scrutiny Committee, whose report provided an extremely good summary of the Court of Auditors report and drew some pertinent conclusions about how the tobacco regime operated and about the necessary reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
It is important that we show unanimity on the Government's dual track attempts to press for further reforms of the tobacco regime. Any regime that rewards a crop such as tobacco at a rate 23 times as high as for cereals shows no common sense. Members of the public scratch their heads in incredulity about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend the motion to the Committee and hope that the spirit of probing and of support for further reform will enable members of the Committee to find it in their hearts to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.26 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elliot Morley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glanford and Scunthorpe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been one of those occasions when there is fair agreement among all members of the Committee about an unacceptable situation that still needs radical reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are concerned about the suggestions in the Court of Auditors report that the Commission has not been particularly co-operative—that there have been delays; that it has not been possible to obtain detailed figures, as was mentioned by some of my hon. Friends; and that we do not know whether there have been proper investigations of corruption in the Commission. We definitely know that one person was involved, so it is not unreasonable to assume that corruption could have spread further through the Commission. We do not think that that has been satisfactorily dealt with, but the Court of Auditors has, yet again, done a good job in identifying fraud and ensuring that action is taken against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem with an agricultural regime under which the profit is derived almost entirely from export refund guarantees. Such agricultural sectors distort the market, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley said. We need urgent reform of the tobacco regime and of the whole common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further issue concerns the intervention of sales and the fact that the premiums were far too high for far too long. I understand that although the new regime has been in place since 1992, parts of the old system—the bad rules—could remain in operation until 1996 because tobacco has been put into storage. I am concerned about that. It needs to be tackled and resolved immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's comments about subsidies. Tobacco is the most highly subsidised crop under the common agricultural policy. Support is nine times higher than for oil seeds, which are generously subsidised. My figures suggest that tobacco support is 35 times higher than that for cereals, which is somewhat higher than the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That contrasts with the very pertinent point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) about the health implications. It is right that the European Community should campaign on the health implications of tobacco and try to reduce consumption, but there is a contrast between the £930 million being spent on the tobacco regime and the 1.1 per cent of that amount spent on the European campaign against cancer budget. It is remarkable that while the European Community is seriously considering banning tobacco advertising on health grounds, which I support, huge sums are being spent on tobacco growing, which produces low-quality, high-tar tobacco—the most harmful and undesirable type of tobacco produced for consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
I have carefully considered the arguments on reform and the Commission's reluctance to argue for a change in the support regime. I take the point that 200,000 jobs are involved. It is sometimes easy for this country, which is not part of the tobacco regime, to demand reforms even though many jobs are at stake, surely it must be possible to redirect such large sums of money to a social support programme to provide an alternative to growing tobacco. That should take the form of direct income support as part of a structural change, even though the Commission rejects hectare support. Such social support would replace support for tobacco growing and would be less prone to fraud. We should encourage such support and realise that we cannot sustain a tobacco regime that has paid more subsidy in one year in the European Community than was paid in the past 50 years to the tobacco-growing industry in the United States. It is such an unjustifiable distortion of the market that action must be taken urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much poor-quality tobacco is being exported at giveaway prices. In a sophisticated fraud against the European Commission, poor-quality tobacco was exported from Italy to Albania, where it was buried—the best thing for it—and the money for the export guarantees was syphoned off through agencies. We cannot tolerate such activity in common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the difficulty with alternative crops and I understand his point. He can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that tobacco is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes. Tomatoes would be an alternative crop if there were a demand and would provide job opportunities for packers. With such large sums of money, there should be scope for such a switch and it should be encouraged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the intention of the reform regime is to reduce the production of tobacco in the Community, but between 1980 and 1991 the amount of tobacco produced in the Community dramatically increased, so the industry is not being supported at a stable level. The CAP policy on the tobacco regime has encouraged an increase in the growing of poor-quality tobacco. In that respect, the regime has so far been a failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tobacco regime is a serious and urgent problem. We support the Government's intention to argue for continued reform and we insist that that is a priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may appear schizophrenic on this issue—as I possibly do on other issues. I am chairman of a cancer charity in my local area, the Marie Curie Cancer Care, which provides nurses for terminal patients in their homes. It plays a vital role not just in my constituency but throughout the United Kingdom. It provides a parallel service to Macmillan nurses, who do a splendid job. In a former life, when I had a real job, I sold tobacco products in a retail convenience store in Swansea. That may seem bizarre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that tobacco is a legal substance and that 20,000 newsagents and convenience stores throughout the country sell tobacco products. At the same time, we can recognise how ludicrous it is that European Community taxpayers' money is being syphoned off to support a product that we all believe to be damaging. My hon. Friend the Minister said that he hopes for a 25 per cent. reduction in our support, but £750 million is still £750 million too much. We must have a zero option and institute a planning
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
procedure over a given period whereby we can reduce support for tobacco growing in the European Community to absolutely zero.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four new countries are coming into the European Community. As my hon. Friend the Minister said, who would have thought that Austria would be eligible for support? We hope that the European Community will be expanded in future and there may be further pressures on the budgets of those new incoming countries which also grow tabacco products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be realistic and tough, but action must be taken over a given period because I am aware that 200,000 people are involved in growing tobacco. From what I can work out, that is a subsidy of about £5,000 per person, which is a large sum for many people. That money could surely be invested to help them to diversify into other crops and so, over some years, they would not be damaged. People in other industries in this country have had to diversify from the products that they grew or made. Therefore, tobacco growers should be involved in that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House will soon debate the Barron Bill on banning tobacco advertising. I shall not support that Bill because I do not believe that advertising tobacco products increases tobacco consumption. I am far more convinced by my experience in the retail trade over at least 10 years—although I was involved in the business from an early age, as happens in families in the retailing business—that people are attracted to tobacco by peer group pressure or by the price of the product. That is why I am delighted that the Government have been so successful in their taxation regime in dissuading people from smoking more or even from smoking at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Excise raised from tobacco products throughout the European Community amounts to about £25.5 billion, which is a massive sum and must be extremely welcome not just to this Government, but to other Governments in the Community. I agree with the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley) that the 1.1 per cent. spent on persuading people not to smoke is absolutely piffling. It amounted to £1.2 million in 1992 and the estimated expenditure for 1993 is the same. It is wonderful that we can control the budget on one area of expenditure, if not on the support for tobacco products.

I referred to my visit to Malawi, where I witnessed the growing of tobacco. I appreciate its importance as an export crop. It is vital because the other crop—maize—is failing badly because of drought. Malawi will look more than ever to countries such as Britain to help support its population through this difficult period. It is absurd that we subsidise tobacco growing here, although my hon. Friend the Minister said that there is no export refund for tobacco producers. The European Community produces a low-quality product, which is shipped out to countries such as Malawi. One British American Tobacco product in Malawi is called Life. I find that rather an absurd name for a packet of 20 cigarettes. It is more absurd if some of our tobacco is going into the production of those cigarettes that they are smoking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With tobacco production, like the production of other crops, we must be very hard on fraud. Firm action has recently been taken on the milk quotas of Italy and Spain. We must redouble our efforts to tackle fraud in the common agricultural policy. A massive sum is being spent on subsidies to agriculture throughout the European

Community. I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe about the need for widespread reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many measures have already been taken and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on his efforts, on our behalf, to ensure that the amount spent on subsidies is reduced. A 25 per cent. reduction is a good start, but we have a long way to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, similarly, am appalled at the details of the report, not only on what appears to be the inadequacy of the European Community to police its subsidy system, particularly since it had salutary lessons in the olive oil schemes that were revealed. I should have thought that the European Community would have learnt from that more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been candid in saying that there has been crime; we are talking about organised crime on a massive scale. Agents of the European Commission stand accused of being involved in large, multinational companies, as well with the middle men, with the complicity of small producers. The subsidy has grown from £200 million to £1 billion and production has grown over the past few years, which means that people realised that they were into stealing money from the European Community on a large scale. I am pleased with the proposed measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only 23 times more subsidised than cereal production, but it is nine times more subsidised than oil seed. As secretary of the science and technology committee of the parliamentary Labour party, I am particularly interested and I hope that there is great scope in the future for biomass technology to produce engines that will use the IS per cent set-aside land for products that may be used industrially and commercially in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point was made about alternatives. Several hon. Members mentioned Andorra. I do not know of anybody who has been there—I certainly have and know that I would prefer to go to Andorra than Malawi. To visit Malawi is possibly very exciting: a good thing to put on one's CV and to discuss over the coffee table. I think that Andorra is an obvious alternative because of tourism; it does not have to grow anything and tourism, if packaged and sold properly, would be much more attractive than the production of tobacco products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great attractions of many areas where small producers exist is that they are beautiful, rural and probably keep some of the best culture of Europe alive. It is a pity that they have to see themselves as having to produce such a nauseous product as tobacco to survive. I think that it would be beneficial for the European Community to spend £1 billion on schemes that would make it more attractive for people to spend their wealth and income from well-off parts of the world in those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not mention research into alternatives. My hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe talked about the land. That alternative is I am sure, not beyond the wit and intelligence of the European Community. It need not be in the interests of the European Community bureaucracy to research and find alternative uses for that land, which might be used for growing products. Those products need not be sold in such a comercial, industrial marketplace, but in a more localised marketplace, where people could buy fresher food to put on the table and help with the obesity problem.

My main concern is about health and the vulgar stance of the European Community, given its vast knowledge of the effects of tobacco on health. The health statistics in the report shaw that 90 per cent of deaths from lung cancer, 75 per cent of deaths from bronchitis or emphysema and 25 per cent of deaths from some form of heart disease are caused by tobacco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My father died of emphysema before I became a Member of Parliament.It is a great sadness for me that he did not live to see me enter the House. It was appalling to see the X-rays of his lungs in his last weeks. He was a 60-a-day man, caught in his early youth by the flash advertising that said that a cigarette between one lips made one a man. I am struck by the number of young women, many of them in business and clearly on the way up, whom I see in London dragging on a fag like crazy addicts. That is amazing. Tobacco is part of the lifestyle. More and more women and young people are becoming addicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I totally disagree with the possibly tongue-in-cheek comments made by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley about advertising. The hon. Gentleman has regaled the Committee before about his life as a retailer of potatoes. He had us weeping. But it is nonsense to suggest that people did not see advertising in the shop that he ran for the items that he wanted to sell. One advertises heavily if one wants to sell something. That is what tobacco advertising is about—selling a product. Anyone who can claim that, for the retail trade, advertising is not the most important means of making people use a product is kidding us all. I know that the hon. Gentleman is really only trying to kid the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pre-empt a debate that will take place in the House next month, but my experience is that the switching of brands is what is important. The introduction of a new brand requires advertising, but that means that customers must switch to another brand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important matter within the European Community as we approach the single market. It would be very difficult for brands of cigarettes to entrench themselves in the European Community market without advertising. The banning of advertising that aims to get people to switch to products from this country has been called a type of protectionism. No one wants people to start smoking, but we must be realistic. Tobacco is a legal product—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a rather lengthy intervention. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make another speech, or to delay this one until 20 May, that may be the right course of action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall return to the subject in the debate on 20 May. I am sure that the same facile arguments will be trotted out. The reality is that the smoker's market is changing. Women and young people are deliberately targeted now, rather than middle-aged males. I am glad to say that I never had the addiction, but men who were addicted are now so conscious of their morbidity that they are beginning to react to the health lobby. Unfortunately, young people and women seem to consider smoking to be part of a lifestyle. That is the result of advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Theoretically, the common agricultural policy is supposed to produce products that are useful to and needed by the Community. Those products are generally healthy to the Community, but tobacco is not. The Government must get much tougher. The motion is weak. That is my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1993-1994V007P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
common criticism of Government motions in this Committee—I always consider them weak. They leave the Government far too much room for inaction and do not force them to declare what actions they will take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were serious about fraud, value for money and a balanced Community—we may be slightly semi-detached at the moment but we should still strive to influence the Community in a way that is a credible extension of Government policy—they must get tougher. The motion should be stronger and should make it a clear aim to bring about the continual reduction of tobacco production in the European Community. It should also offer alternatives to people who need the subsidies—which we do not criticise—to maintain their life in the places where they live at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.49 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a genuinely useful debate. In the House of Commons, every Member who contributes to a debate puts a new perspective on complex problems such as this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee expressed a unanimous view about the continuing need for reform. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East chided us because the motion was not stronger. In a generous moment, the hon. Gentleman might join me in congratulating Ministers with responsibility for agriculture who have fought to reform the tobacco regime and the Community approach to fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe was anxious about regimes such as tobacco which distorted markets. He will know from previous discussions on agricultural matters that we have been leading lights in trying to reform the CAP. One of the major reasons for change is to try to end that type of distortion. We have a common cause in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was worried that the full effects of the new tobacco regime would not be felt until 1996, because of stocks held under the old regime. I understand his frustration but retrospection would not have been in order as people were working under the old regime. We are aware, as never before, of the potential fraud. That awareness will inform the Court of Auditors and others who are examining the issue. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman made an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley and the hon. Member for Falkirk, East rightly drew our attention to the chilling impact on people of the consumption of tobacco. We share the wish that education will, somehow or other, tackle that issue. Had a Minister from the Department for Health been present, he would have reassured the hon. Member for Ribble Valley that the Government take the matter seriously, and that £12 million of United Kingdom funds will be spent on a health education programme in the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley was the alternatives that might be used; that was the theme of contributions by other hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Members, too. I highlighted the difficulties faced by the areas involved in tobacco production. It is important to stress that some of those areas receive European Community structural fund aid. With some imaginative thinking, an alternative method of utilising the economic potential of the people in those areas may be found. As I said, the Government are not willing to investigate suggestions, such as an income support system, to assist with alternative activities in the relevant parts of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed the matter of health versus growing the product. I hope that I showed that the regime, recognising that 670,000 tonnes of tobacco are consumed in the Community, attempts to persuade those who remain in the trade to produce the low-tar variety that the markets wants and which, in relative terms, may be safer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East reminded us of the delights of Andorra, but before anyone becomes confused, I must state that it is not a member of the European Union. The hon. Gentleman's one-man tourist advertisement for Andorra is noted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I return to the points raised by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes). He rightly asked what could happen to report 8/93. It will be considered as part of the discharge given to the Commission for the implementation of the 1993 budget. The report is at present being considered by a Council working group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about delay. I gather that the production of this report followed normal procedures and that there was no undue delay. It was given to Council on 11th January, although it was not published in the 	<i>Official Journal until</i> 2nd March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should recognise that the report is now available and is, as I have said, subject to further process and eventual, scrutiny by the Council and the European Parliament. We shall maintain pressure to ensure that the report is fully examined. I should not want anyone to run away with the idea that because of the complexity of the consideration process we would not keep up the pressure for consideration of the report and of the need for further reform of the regime. Both sides of the Committee appear to be unanimous that the expenditure of almost £1 billion on tobacco products is wholly unnacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 4311/94 relating to European Court of Auditors Special Report No. 8/93 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco; and strongly supports the Government's policy to continue to press for further reform of the tobacco regime and for appropriate measures to be taken to prevent fraud.</p></q></p>
