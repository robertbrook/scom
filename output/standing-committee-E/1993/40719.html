<br><br><!-- lb --> Guidelines</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Roads and Traffic (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Martin. May I say once again what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the entry into force of the treaty on European Union last November, the European Community treaty has a new title covering trans-European networks, or TENs. TENs are infrastructure networks in transport, telecommunications and energy. In the single market, linking infrastructure networks at the European level is now of considerable economic importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the treaty, a series of so-called guidelines is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers. They are to include specific projects of common interest, which the Community may support financially. The Commission's proposals for guidelines in three sectors—telecommunications, energy and transport—are now under consideration in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of transport, decisions covering combined transport, road and inland waterways were adopted on 29 October 1993. The Commission's current proposal is aimed at integrating the network guidelines of different transport modes into a single transport trans-European network. The proposal covers airports, ports, rail, and shipping navigation and air traffic control components and updates the three networks agreed last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Separately from the work on the guidelines, the Christophersen group has been working to identify priority projects in transport and energy. In its interim report to the Corfu European Council in June, the group identified a first list of 11 priority projects in the transport sector. The projects were endorsed by the European Council, and the member states were asked to make every effort to ensure that they were begun during 1996 at the latest. At present, we have two projects of United Kingdom interest in the top priority list—the proposed new channel tunnel rail link and a railway link from Larne via Belfast to the Republic of Ireland. The Christophersen group will submit a final report to the next European Council in Essen in December, by which time projects may well have been added to the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although designation as a priority project by the Christophersen group has no legal significance, it is likely that those transport projects will form the core of the so-called "projects of common interest" to be adopted by the Transport Council later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
TENs projects will be financed from a mix of public and private sector sources. There will be three primary sources of EC grant support for TENs: the existing cohesion and structural funds, and finance under a proposed TENs financial regulation covering interest rate subsidies, the payment of loan guarantee premiums, support for feasibility studies, and, in exceptional cases, cofinancing of projects. EC loans and guarantees will also continue to be available from the European investment bank and European investment fund respectively. None the less, the private sector and national Governments will continue to be the most important sources of TENs finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should emphasise that designation by the Christophersen group of a priority project does not guarantee EC money. Projects will have to be considered on a case-by-case basis against the criteria and funding rules established for each of the applicable funding instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Corfu council did not endorse the Commission's view that new Community financial instruments were necessary to fund the priority projects. It decided instead that the financing needs of each of the projects should first be examined on a case-by-case basis. That work is now getting under way in a series of study groups. The Christopherson group report was considered by European Standing Committee B on 6 July together with the proposed TENs financial regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present proposal seeks to define the objectives, scope and priorities of the transport network and to establish criteria for the selection of projects of common interest. The scope of the network is defined in terms of the individual transport modes so that there is a network for roads, another for rail, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal also covers related management and control systems, such as air traffic control and the vessel traffic management information system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The components of the network guidelines are at various stages of development and the Government have proposed several amendments, particularly to the rail and road networks. The proposal defines airports of common interest based on a set of criteria. There is no proposed network for ports, but the Commission has instead put forward a proposed set of criteria for assessing ports projects. As I have said, the Commission's objective is to integrate the network guidelines for all transport modes into a single trans-European transport network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider that the establishment of trans-European transport networks will make an important contribution to the functioning of the single market and thereby to the competitiveness of European business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made efforts to ensure that sufficient UK routes are included in each of the networks. That is important to ensure that the UK has the opportunity to obtain a fair share of Community funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several ways in which the proposed decision could be further improved. First, in accordance with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
principle of subsidiarity, it should be made explicit that decisions on infrastructure development must remain the responsibility of the individual member states, as is the case for the three transport guidelines already agreed. Secondly, private as well as public sector transport projects should be eligible. Thirdly, the definition of the term "project of common interest" needs to be clarified; there needs to be a clear understanding of which projects are eligible for support, and which are not. Finally, provisions should be included which will ensure that, as far as possible, distortion of competition is avoided, particularly in the ports and airports sectors. That is important for the UK because of the high proportion of facilities in private sector ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the decision was adopted by the Commission, member states have met three times at official level to discuss it. Some progress has been made on some of the points that I have just mentioned and we have received good support from other member states, but much work needs to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the commitments made by Heads of State and Government at Brussels and Corfu, I hope that members of the Committee will agree that the proposal is important, that its adoption will make a substantial contribution to the establishment of a trans-European network in the transport sector and that the Government's proposed approach to negotiations on the draft decision is the right one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, too, say what a pleasure it is to serve on this complicated European Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First I want to question the Minister on the issue of sustainable mobility. I have listened carefully to him, but Opposition Members are concerned that any common transport policy should be based on the important concept of sustainable mobility. Will the Minister say how he defines sustainable projects and how the guidelines to which he has just referred will ensure that whatever is decided in discussions about trans-European networks will have sustainable projects at its heart? How does he propose to take full account of the EC habitats directive when developing different transport networks? What proposals have already been discussed with the Department of the Environment and with his colleague at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the implementation of special conservation areas and special priority areas, which, I understand, are currently under discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we have already set out our views on sustainable transport policy. That is at the heart of the Government's entire policy of sustainable growth in the British economy. For example, the commitment, which we announced in the November Budget, to increase road fuel duties by at least 5 per cent. each year in real terms undoubtedly strengthens the policy that was announced in the March Budget and completes the package of measures that was aimed at our obligations under the climate change convention to return CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The habitats directive regulations are being debated on the Floor of the House this evening and it would be wrong for me to pre-empt that discussion. The regulations are subject to affirmative resolution. I understand that the Lords debate has yet to be timetabled. I am aware of the conclusions and recommendations of the House of Lords European Communities Committee in this regard. They were published on 25 May. My Department will respond to them by the due date of 25 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are fully aware of the problems raised by the hon. Lady. Much more remains to be said on the subject, but I am confident that a sustainable transport policy will be achieved in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I note my hon. Friend's remark that no new instruments are proposed as yet, will he explain how the Government will guard against the possibility that the United Kingdom—a net contributor to the European Union budget—will be asked to contribute massive funds to a programme estimated to be worth 220 billion ecu to build roads in other parts of the Community? The maps show that roads are planned to be built and improved almost everywhere, for example in Spain and Greece, and in other peripheral areas of the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the chance to underline the fundamental purpose of the TENs. It is to provide indicative routes across the Community in a number of modes. There is no question that the European Union will seek funds to build all the roads, airports, ports, railways and so on. In the vast majority of cases, it is clear that all European Union countries will continue with their own infrastructure development, and that most of the finance will come from Government sources within the member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A metamorphosis in the existing transport infrastructure fund is already under way. This year that fund is worth 200 million ecu, or about £150 million. United Kingdom projects that are supported, including feasibility studies for the channel tunnel rail link, amount to about £12 million, or 8 per cent. of the resources. That fund will be replaced by the new TENs fund in 1995, subject to the adoption of the TENs financial regulations, which this Committee has debated already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 13 of the guidelines does not state that the measures are indicative but that
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the common transport market, the existing infrastructure … must be refurbished. Up to the year 2010, an investment volume of ECU 400 billion is estimated … projects costing ECU 220 billion have been identified for implementation up to the year 2000."</p></blockquote>
How does that chime with what the Minister has just said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That figure is an indicative cost, but no mention is made of who will fund it. The intention remains that the amount will be funded by the member states, not out of some crock of gold that has yet to be discovered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend confirm that any money to go to European transport networks must be found from within the budget ceilings already agreed by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the Council of Ministers? Is he confident that the criteria for such projects are sufficiently stringent to prevent British taxpayers' money being siphoned off to pay for uneconomic projects in other parts of the European Community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government firmly oppose new Community funding instruments. As I have said, the Corfu European Council did not endorse the Commission's proposals. The criteria need further work. I have read through the documents presented by the Commission, and much remains to be said about them. In some cases, the criteria are very clear; for example, section 6 of the proposal sets down clearly the eligibility criteria for airports. It is less clear what we mean by "ports". The Commission was initially keen that we should list all ports, ferries between the ports and so on, but it was more or less unanimously decided that that was unrealistic and that it was not even realistic to prioritise the importance of ports within individual countries, let alone within the Community. So those criteria are far less clear. However, I would be grateful for the views of members of the Committee on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This subject is of major significance, for at least a generation to come. It is also a very complicated one. I wish to ask the Minister about roads within the trans-European system. Are the criteria selected by the Commission for prioritising roads identical to the criteria used by the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposal is the British Government's choice and we have made sure that the interests of Northern Ireland are properly accounted for. There will always be room for argument about whether the trans-European road network routes should be more extensive; however, in the case of Northern Ireland, a good pattern of TERN routes is proposed, but the links between the ports on either side and from other parts of the United Kingdom and from other member states are perhaps more important. The TERN routes were proposed by the British Government. We have made some amendments. The Commission has endorsed the route from Felixstowe across the country towards Northern Ireland and we have extended that so that it does not go only to Anglesey but up the west coast, so that there is greater choice of routes to Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the trans-European transport networks are being discussed this morning, because they are important in the development of the single market. However, I ask the Minister for reassurance that Britain's inland waterways will not be forgotten. A hundred or so years ago, they were vital in the transport of goods. I feel so sad that they have been allowed to decline and I hope that, under the direction of my hon. Friend the Minister, they will be used more fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing would please me more, because Britain's canal infrastructure was indeed, very important in the past. Now, however, it is of comparitively little commercial interest and canal traffic does not measure up to the volume of traffic being carried by many other European Community countries. That is not to say that the use of our waterways cannot be developed, but at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
moment—this year, at any rate—there is not much scope for us to take part in the waterway network.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with the issue of the interoperability of the European high-speed train network? Will he assure us that the British Government will not be penny-pinching in putting into operation the technical specifications, particularly in signalling? In the TGV, signalling is in-cab. There have been so many disasters in Britain because of bad signalling: the one in Glasgow and the one at Clapham, for example. Will the Minister assure us that the Government will not simply take the proposal as a directive, but will implement it in a way that ensures the better safety of passengers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course interoperability is extremely important. Obviously, if high-speed trains, in particular, are traversing several countries, there should be compatibility—not only between safety and signalling systems, for example, but between standards of infrastructure equipment and operational equipment. However, I must be careful not to go down that route too far because an explanatory memorandum was submitted to Parliament on 13 June and the Select Committee on European Legislation has decided that the proposal should not be debated at this stage as the Committee is awaiting the promised supplementary explanatory memorandum and cost-compliance assessment. Those will be submitted after the Transport Council's orientation debate in November this year, when the scope and thus the costs of implementation will be clearer. Therefore, I had better not say more at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned two priority projects for the United Kingdom; one of those was the Larne-Belfast Irish Republic rail link. Will the Minister tell us about the input and the output from the European Community and how that is dealt with? Is the matter dealt with through the Department of Transport or through the Northern Ireland Office, or is it part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement discussions and links? How does our co-ordinated position seek to link in with European co-ordination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clearly important to the whole of the rail infrastructure that we take a global vie w of all the islands of the United Kingdom. I am not aware that the matter is part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement discussions. My interest in it is to promote a sensible integrated rail pattern for the United Kingdom. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we have taken great care in selecting the rail routes, which are all, I think, fairly self-evident. There is, of course, discussion about whether there should be extensions to the indicative systems which have been proposed so far. Once again, I would welcome the opinion of the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, as my hon. Friend says, the financing of the schemes will primarily be a matter for the member states, why do we need the plan and the proposals? Surely the member states should organise and prioritise their own requirements. I do not understand the European competence unless European finance is involved. I suspect that at the end of the day there will be a lot of European finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give two answers to that question. First, the Government recognise that this is a single market argument and that if we can ensure that there is a level playing field in transport across the Community, that will be to the benefit of industry in Britain. I speak to industrialists and, indeed, to the work forces of several industries located far from the south-east of England. Whether in Cornwall or Scotland, there is no doubt at all that transport links are fundamental to the economic prosperity of the country—they are fundamental to employment, to prosperity and to the quality of life. Therefore, I must bear it in mind that the United Kingdom is at the periphery of our largest single market and that single markets mean a great deal to ordinary people in their everyday lives. That is the motive behind the Government embracing the concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on finance, different member states have different motives. For example, some of the Scandinavian states which I hope will shortly be joining us have sophisticated transport systems and expensive infrastuctures. No doubt they will not want much help from the European Union, although they will be net contributors to the Union, as we are. Other states, however, with less well-developed transport infrastructures will, no doubt, be knocking on the door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A short while ago the Minister told us that the guidelines had not really been sorted out in terms of criteria. In that case, why has he already agreed to additions to the road network from the United Kingdom? They include the M25 between junctions 3 and 5, the M27 between Southampton and Portsmouth, the M62 between the M6 and the M4, the A465/A40 heads of the valleys route, the M8/A8 and the M77/A77. Should not we sort out the criteria and guidelines first?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The point is that we as a Government must decide on our priorities in each mode. Those priorities are quite clear, It is clear to us that if we are to have sensible indicative routes with a European dimension we should be able to put them on paper to the Commission. That is exactly what we have done. That implies nothing about the funding of those routes by the Commission. We must ensure that the United Kingdom's road system does not disadvantage our industrial base. I look forward to hearing which of the proposed routes the hon. Lady would try to delete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On page 8 of the Commission document there is a statement that the actions of member states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"must be coherent with the guidelines which have been established at Community level."</p></blockquote>
To what extent is the Government's freedom of action constrained by that reference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very little, not least because many other European Union states agree with us that we should have tighter definitions in these matters. France and Germany share some of our concerns about the criteria. One of the reasons why the criteria have not yet appeared in black and white—on tablets of stone, if not on recycled paper from Brussels—is because there is a great divergence of opinion
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
between member states about exactly what the criteria should be.

I have already mentioned that for some modes the task is more obvious and easier than trying to introduce a hierarchy of roads. That applies to airports, although some of my hon. Friends might not think so in relation to their constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What studies are likely to be undertaken at the Commission's instigation? Section B on "Community Actions and Subsidiarity" on page 8 of the document to which the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) referred makes it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The incentives at the Community's disposal must make it possible to … reduce … constraints at national level and convince a Member State, if necessary, to carry out a project which is within its field of competence … It is in this spirit that Community financing will favour measures".</p></blockquote>
How many projects? Where? What kind of money will be involved? Who will instigate those projects? What is a 2A committee and, as the Minister referred to airports, will he tell us why there is such an imbalance in the list of airports in the document?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point to make is that we must remember that we are an island. I understand the section to which the hon. Lady referred to mean that if traffic from one country to another has crossed through a third, either on land or perhaps by air or even by sea, the situation may be different from that which we are used to in this country. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor) understands what it means to have another country between his own country and its market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 6 on page 81 gives the eligibility criteria for airports of common interest. The criteria are clear. The way in which airports in this country have been categorised is straightforward. We have done better than we had thought in the first place because we have managed to add airports that were not on the original list. For example, St. Mary's airport in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris), Newquay airport and Plymouth airport were not on the original list. Airports have been categorised in that way because the criteria are clear. The relationship between our regional airports and external flights is an important but different issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister knows that there is continuing opposition by road lobbies to postulated damage to the environment created by roads. Could any of this European funding be used to enhance goods transport on the rail network by creating infinitely larger goods yards in inner cities? Had the Victorians thought of that, it might have been done in the beginning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Government's policy to encourage freight back onto rail, which we do through the freight facilities grants. We have been keen to promote the channel tunnel as a new source for freight. I cannot say that there will be an enormous southern surge of freight through the channel tunnel or back onto rail, but, as the recession comes to an end, there is a marked increase in the amount of freight being moved. There are also innovative proposals for the use of piggy-back freight transport and some bold private sector proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our policy to encourage freight back onto rail. I have no doubt that privatisation of the railways will enhance that because, for once, railway operators are going out to search for new markets for freight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Eventually, after considerable delay, the Committee examined the Council of Auditors report on environmental matters. That report pointed out that many European Community projects were financially counter-productive. Can we be assured that the project for common transport provision takes into account serious environmental considerations? Is there a role in that for the Department of the Environment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is a role for the Department of the Environment. That is why we work so closely with it on a daily basis at ministerial and official level. I am conscious of the need for transport developments to have a proper environmental assessment. The environmental assessments of transport infrastructure projects in this country are way ahead of those in many other countries. We have already a taxing system of inspection and public as well as official and legal scrutiny of such matters. Perhaps I am straying slightly because this evening the House will debate the habitats directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get down to some detail. If the Minister cannot answer the questions that is fair enough. I realise that that may not be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider annex I—with the lovely little maps—at the back of the Commission proposal. The trouble is that the maps are so small that they are difficult to follow. Reference has been made already to the railway system within the island of Ireland. As one who represents a Northern Ireland constituency, I welcome the proposal on page 12, which seems to make sense. Has the Minister found the place? The pages are not numbered; he must count from one to 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a railway line from Dublin to Belfast and a spur from that line to Londonderry in the north-west. I am more interested in the deep black line from Belfast to Larne. The Minister and other members of the Committee referred to the Stranraer route. That does not seem to have the same priority as the lines to Dublin and to Londonderry, yet
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Larne is reportedly the second largest passenger ferry port in the United Kingdom. Its freight includes one third of the —[	<i>interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. No strangers are allowed in the Committee. If such conduct continues, there is a risk that the Committee will be suspended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me go through this matter again because it is complicated. Has the Minister found the map to which I am referring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we talking about this one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think so. Three railway lines in Northern Ireland are shown. One runs from Belfast to Dublin. Another goes from that line to Londonderry in the north-west. However, the third runs from Belfast to Larne, which leads across to Scotland. The Minister said in passing that I would know well the problems of having another country between one's country and its market. I hope that he meant Scotland, because that is the other country which is between Northern Ireland and its market. I hope that he was not thinking in other directions. Market forces dictate that most of our freight goes from Larne to Stranraer and through Scotland. I am therefore anxious to have some clarification from the Minister of why the line to Larne, which leads to the second busiest ferry port in the United Kingdom and which is our main access route to Scotland, does not have the same priority as the lines to Londonderry and to Dublin, which would not be used so much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Christopherson group's first priority project was for a rail link from Cork through Dublin to Belfast and Larne and across to Stranraer. We have consulted with Northern Ireland Railways Ltd., with British Rail and, latterly, with Railtrack about prioritisation and the construction of that rail link. Ultimately, Northern Ireland Railways Ltd. will have to prioritise investment in the light of demand on the route and determine which lines should be represented on the map. The combined transport network—combined transport is importnat, too—is intended to represent those rail routes presently used for the movement of unitised freight or those that may be used in the near future. That will be important for the economic development of Northern Ireland, because unitised freight will be a significant part of freight movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Gentleman need not read anything sinister into the thickness of the lines on the map at this stage. Indeed, I sometimes wish that the Commission had not produced these wretched maps, which have caused many people much confusion. It might have been better if we could have dealt with real places and names instead. However, it has produced a map, and it is right that we should deal with it. Furthermore, because we are at a comparitively early stage of this process, I welcome the Committee's views on where the priorities are wrong. I think that that was the point that the hon. Gentleman was making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer the Minister to paragraph 26 on page 11 of the Commission's proposals? It states that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the rail network will connect the major parts of the Community, with services travelling up to 200 kph. Does the Minister think that this document, if it is enacted, will bring about the links that we want between the Eurotunnel and London and from London to Scotland? At the moment, a joke is going around to the effect that people go into the tunnel on the continental side in 1994 and come out in Britain in 1894. On some parts of the line between the tunnel and London, one has to travel at 47 mph. I have been to the tunnel twice and have been embarrassed at the lack of progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be candid, the document will not make much difference to that project, because the project predates it by many years. I am confident that the west coast main line, which is the subject of substantial interest at the moment, as the hon. Gentleman will know, will be upgraded. That will happen irrespective of this piece of paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall witness the development of trains that are able to travel at higher average speeds. Furthermore, it is important to recognise that we start from a higher base than many countries in the European Union in terms of efficient rail net words and speed on the main lines. We have a consistently higher average speed than most other European Union countries on their conventional lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What precisely is the significance of this railway map? What does it mean? If I am right in thinking that the lines that look like railways on it will have top priority, why is the Great Western line from Bristol to Penzance not given that status?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To which status is my hon. Friend referring, and to which map?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the difficulties about European documents is that they are not numbered. I am referring to the map of the railway network, which I shall pass to my hon. Friend. He will see that the central system appears to have hatched lines. My French is not good, but I take the text to mean that the areas designated by those lines have the top priority, while those sketched in black have a lesser priority. That suggests to me that the line stretching south from Bristol has lesser priority in European terms. Why should that be, given the importance of the Great Western line?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The map to which he refers can be found on page 25 of the document. It is the "Outline Plan (2010 Horizon)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to what the people in Brussels thought they were drawing when they made this map, I confess that it beats me. I agree with my hon. Friend that the map lacks internal consistency. We have tried to ensure that discussion in the technical working groups has focused on defining criteria accurately to determine which lines should be included. We shall press for those sensible networks, including the Great Western line, which are so important for the economic development of West Cornwall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I agree that the map is inconsistent. I disclaim all responsibility for it. We shall continue to argue for more consistency. We have suggested further additions to the United Kingdom conventional rail network, and I am grateful for the views expressed by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has just said, is not his perception of the trans-European network planning at variance with that of the rest of Europe? We do not have a rail or combined transport development programme that is backed by Government because all decisions are now left to Railtrack. In the absence of a level playing field for investment, we are judging our transport proposals on a different basis from the rest of Europe. Is not that the reason for the differences in the way in which the maps are drawn up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is getting confused. We are trying to ensure consistency in transport infrastructure across Europe for the benefit of the single market. That will include important questions of interoperability, which will be considered further by the House after November. Meanwhile, it is clear that member states have different approaches to transport provision. Some have a highly centralised and bureaucratic transport planning system, usually dominated by politicians who think that they can plan better than the market. In this country, much more is in the private sector, but that does not mean that public sector investment is not planned and co-ordinated properly. It is. My Department spends about 40 per cent of its budget on .public transport, which accounts for only 10 per cent. of journeys. That shows how much importance we attach to public transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee how long it will be before the Council of Ministers reaches a decision? One of our most frequent complaints is that matters are referred to the Committee very late in the decision-making process. I hope that when the interoperability documents are referred to us in November or December we do not find that the decisions are all cut and dried without having been subject to proper scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident that that will not happen. We did not make much progress on this matter under the Greek presidency. The German presidency has shown that it means to take the matter forward, but it is not the first priority. The fact that we must wait until November before we discuss the interoperability documents suggests to me that there will not be undue haste in moving forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is meant in article 25 on page 45 by
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission may specify the projects of common interest in accordance with the procedure laid down"?</p></blockquote>
Further, page 46 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission shall adopt measures which shall apply immediately.</p></blockquote>
The Commission however, may delay them for one month and the Council may take a different decision. Does that mean that, for major infrastructure projects, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Commission may identify something as being of common interest, implement it and then wait for Ministers to take a different decision? I also ask again, what is the meaning of a 2A committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking inspiration on the last point. I sought inspiration a little while ago, but inspiration came there none; I am still living in hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question on procedure, it is important for the Committee to remember that prioritisation is part of the Christophersen process, which is named after the Commissioner responsible for economic development, and that all member states are participating in that process. It is a modest proposal of priorities, which I described in my opening remarks. The procedure as described by article 26 is clear. The article ends by pointing out that qualified majority voting may be the order of the day. I assure you, Mr. Martin, that the minute I get inspiration on committee 2A, I shall inform the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave a full reply to my first question about the map of the railways on page 12, but he failed to explain why the lines from Belfast to Dublin and from Belfast to Londonderry were hatched, whereas the most important line, to Larne, was not hatched—it was simply a solid line. I thought that he hinted that that was the responsibility of Northern Ireland Railways Ltd. We think that the line from Larne is important. The Minister was very fair in recognising the importance of links between Northern Ireland and Scotland in the trans-European network.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that if we allow the maps that have been supplied by the European Commission to go unchallenged they will be confirmed without us having further opportunity to amend them. The Minister will be aware that we have two motorways in Northern Ireland; will he explain why the Commission has abolished both motorways in its map of Ireland on page 5? They seem to have disappeared. The map shows a planned road from Belfast to the west, but we already have a motorway—the Ml—there. There is also a planned road from Belfast to Londonderry but the M2 already covers part of that stretch. We have only two motorways and yet the European Commission has abolished both on the map. I am getting confused. I know that things are confusing in Ireland, but that is going too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is about the road from Belfast to Dublin. It is one of the less important roads in the island of Ireland, believe it or not. It carries only 8,000 vehicles per day. The road from Ulster to Scotland, leading from Belfast to Larne, is much more important, and carries 16,000 vehicles a day. Why does not it have priority in the trans-European network when it is the road used most by people in Ireland, by frieght and by tourists? I would like to see that road given priority above all the road schemes in Northern Ireland in the context of the trans-Eruropean network.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is getting very difficult because my page 5 is a map of Greece, so it is Greek to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be helpful if I gave the Minister my copy? With your permission, Mr. Martin, I shall pass it to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. I share the right hon. Gentleman's concern that the M1 and M2 appear to have been at least partially obliterated. However, that gives me the opportunity to explain that the trans-European road network proposal says nothing about whether a road shall be a motorway, a dual carriageway or a single carriageway. It states that such a road shall be engineered to a reasonably high standard. Many of the roads shown as trans-European road network roads in the United Kingdom are not dual carriageways. For example, the road from Carlisle to Stranraer is clearly not a motorway—most of it is not a dual carriageway either, but it is a road of high standard. That is what matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to the issues that the right hon. Gentleman raised about railways, the distinction is that the Belfast to Dublin line is an inter-city high-speed line and categorised as such, whereas the Belfast to Larne line is a conventional line. That misunderstanding underlines once again the inadequacy of some of the railway maps. Of course, it is the function of the Committee to highlight such errors and I am grateful that that has happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer my hon. Friend to page 19 of the document and to paragraph 58 on traffic management, which discusses the objective of setting up
	<br><blockquote><p>"a European traffic management system based on a common approach ensuring interconnection and interoperability of the existing systems."</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend explain what that proposal is designed to achieve and what it will actually do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am grateful for the opportunity to explain that, because it is one of the areas in which there will be real benefits. Next week—No. 10 willing—I anticipate that I will be down at the end of the channel tunnel with a bus load of journalists trying to explain to them the virtues of this very point. There is a remarkable system called Pliades, which illustrates that technology is very much on our side when it comes to making the best use of our road resources. The system will provide a corridor from London to Paris through the channel tunnel where motorists can be informed in advance of any hold-ups on the roads, of the best routes to take, of time delays in getting through channel tunnel trains and so on—no doubt information about the weather will be available too. The service will be available in French and English. Moreover, there is the possibility of satellite uplink from individual vehicles which will allow instant plots on in-car maps of where the vehicle is at any one time. It will even give a commentary to drivers so that, for example when they approach a roundabout the machine will tell them to take the second exit, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the technological issues which are addressed under the schemes. The schemes are very much to the advantage of the users of the highways of Europe. They try to get right extremely advanced and difficult
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
technology for the benefit of the European consumer. That is why the Government support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to express my concern about the lack of hatch on the east midlands main line on the map on page 25. It seems to be squashed out by the east coast line and the west coast line. There is hatching between Leeds, Sheffield and Birmingham but not down to London where the link should develop to allow access to the channel tunnel. In my area, there is great concern that hatching should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there are areas of transport policy in which the European Community has exclusive competence and others in which it has no competence whatever. There are also areas of competence and of potential competence. In some areas of competence, the Community can build up to establish exclusive competence. Therefore, the proposals before us may extend the areas of the European Community's exclusive competence, regardless of subsidiarity. That might not be a bad thing, but hon. Members should be aware that the proposals are part of the important, centralised planning taking place throughout Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, I note what the hon. Gentleman said and I shall ensure that his anxieties are taken into account as we revise the railway maps. What matters is what happens on the ground and on the track for the consumers who wish to travel from the hon. Gentleman's constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right about the issues of subsidiarity and competence. There are areas of exclusive competence and other areas in which no competence has yet been exercised. In those areas, the member states have the right to inform the Commission that they intend to make regulations of their own. At present, three months notice must be given, and the Commission must respond within a year. Those regulations will change as from next year, but the hon. Gentleman is right that we must be sure that the Commission does not rush ahead of itself in those areas. Individual member states will provide most of the finance, so it is important that they are able to prioritise their own transport needs, bearing in mind the European dimension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying point for my hon. Friends in the Committee is that the importance of the single market is the reason for doing all this. That point should mollify the most Euro-sceptic of my hon. Friends: it is not a bad reason for the Government's actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will not mind if I press him on the ability of the directives to change the speed at which transport infrastructure—especially rail infrastrucutre—is established in the United Kingdom. The Minister said that the link with the Eurotunnel and the west coast main line had been proposed. He talked about the time before the directives were introduced. I went down to the Eurotunnel about three years ago. I was told about the plans for the line and for the Ashford international exchange, but when I returned six months
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
ago nothing had happened. Scottish Members have heard for the past decade about the upgrading of the west coast main line, and the Government recently made more proposals for that line, but still nothing has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister mean that such projects cannot be taken back to the European Commission because of the inability of the private and public sectors to act on what had been discussed previously? Is it not worrying that the Government are making promises about a number of projects which will be eligible for finance and support when the directives are implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The truth is the reverse of that: we are moving ahead on the financing of the channel tunnel rail link, far in advance of anything that might emerge from these proposals. First of all, we must get Parliament's authority for the work. The hon. Gentleman knows that that will be achieved through a hybrid Bill to be deposited in November. The winning promoter group must be selected from the four that have pre-qualified. We intend that that will be done before the end of this month. Bids will be received six months after that. Allowing time for negotiations, I expect that a promoter will be appointed early next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A mass of detailed work will be required to refine design before construction can start. The project will be huge. It will cost about £3 billion: a railway 180 km long will require about five years to construct, starting late in 1996 or in 1997. That is all in hand now. We do not need to wait for the implementation of these proposals. Private finance will come in to build the project. As I said at the start, most of the money for the transport infrastructure will be private.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable progress has been made on the west coast main line. Railtrack has appointed a private sector consortium—the West Coast Main Line Development Company Ltd.—to produce and design standards for the line and to recommend funding options for the project that are consistent with our private finance initiative. The joint study is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Further competition will then be held for the contract to undertake the upgrading work. It is expected to let that contract by mid-1995—just a year from now—and the work will start as soon as possible thereafter. Good progress is being made on both those major infrastructure routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a flash of inspiration about committees, in response to the question from the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody). Committees of member states chaired by the Commission are regularly established to implement Community decisions. Those committees are of three types: type 1 is advisory, type 2 is management and type 3 is regulatory. The proposal is for a type 2B committee—a management committee. However, we are pushing for a regulatory type 3B committee to give member states maximum control. When the views of the Commission and of member states differ, the issue goes to the Council. Under type 3B, the Council can take decisions that are different from those of the Commission by a simple majority. That is what we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We now come to the debate. Before I call the Minister to speak to the motion, I repeat
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
my earlier statement that I have not selected the amendment which was tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 7073/94, relating to the development of trans-European transport networks; and endorses the Government's proposed approach to negotiations on the proposal in the Council.</p></blockquote>
The decision is indicative in nature and will not commit the United Kingdom or any other member state to improving or upgrading the transport network. The Government support the proposal in principle, but have been pressing for changes. We want the inclusion of provisions that promote private sector projects and avoid distortion of competition. We want the proposal in particular to recognise the commercial nature of port and airport operations in the United Kingdom. Finally, we believe that there should be a clearer definition of the term "projects of common interest".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other member states share many of those concerns and we expect significant progress to be made during the German presidency, which aims at adopting a common position at the Transport Council in November. Much work remains to be done with other member states, the European Parliament and the Commission so that our interests are secured. I need hardly remind the Committee that the United Kingdom is a net contributor to the Community budget. Therefore, we have combined a positive approach to the guidelines with a tough line on some details. I hope that hon. Members agree that that approach is correct. I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that you have not selected our amendment, Mr. Martin, because it would have given us an opportunity to debate the heart of transport policy—the way in which transport policy can be compatible with sustainable mobility and with environmental issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent report in the other place by the Select Committee on the European Communities on common transport policy—sustainable mobility—concluded that excessive road traffic growth would cause economic inefficiency and environmental damage and that the trans-European road network proposal for the United Kingdom would carry only a small proportion of international traffic. We broadly agree with those conclusions and want to put on record the importance of environmental concerns being at the heart of the Government's approach to the trans-European network negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a carefully thought out approach. We should consider how we can fully implement the European habitats and species directive and we should take on board everything in the fifth European environmental action programme. It is not that long since the Government signed the framework convention on climate change that was agreed at the Rio summit. Given the answers to the questions put this morning, it does not seem that these
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
environmental issues are at the heart of the Government's transport policy, which could be taken further in the light of the paper that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: (St. Ives). Just for the sake of clarity, I should point out that when the hon. Lady referred to the Select Committee on European Legislation she meant the House of Lords Select Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>Hansard</i> will bear me out. It will show that I referred to a report produced in the other place. I confirm what the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he intends to work closely with the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health. At this very moment, the Labour party is launching its environment document, which sets out how we intend to deal with the need to integrate transport policy with environmental issues. Neither the documents nor the Minister has dealt with that sufficiently. The Government's transport policy is just about road building and not about the other forms of transport that are detailed in these proposals, such as high speed rail links, regional rail links, airports, ports, inland waterways and coastal shipping, which was touched on briefly by the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson). The common transport policy submitted to the House of Lords by the Town and Country Planning Association showed that a road network was constructed to service the port of Felixstowe at the same time as port developments at the Isle of Grain showed that perhaps there was no strategic commitment to the port of Felixstowe. Our transport policy is determined by the private sector, market forces and competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a reply to a parliamentary question that I tabled recently, the Government said that they were not prepared to shift the balance of research towards inland waterways and coastal shipping and away from roads. It is clear that the Government do not have any understanding of an intergrated transport policy. I listened carefully to the Minister and I am not satisfied that our future discussions will be based on an integrated transport policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much confusion about whether there is a commitment to a railway link that will serve the south-west of the country. I know how dear that subject is to the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris). The Government will not openly acknowledge that there is a world of difference between the dotted lines on the maps in the report showing the proposals to upgrade routes and the other lines. There are many dotted lines for upgrading projects on the British road map but none on the rail and combined transport map. The Government may discover the error of their ways as a result of what has been said this morning and make as many proposals for the high-speed rail and local rail network services as they have for the road network. However, I suspect that they will not, and I am sorry that I did not have an opportunity during questions to press the Minister on whether all the proposals relate to roads and none to railways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's plans for a trans-European network are at variance with those of the rest of Europe. The Government do not back any rail or combined transport
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
development programme. The Minister told us about the various competitions that will shortly achieve some progress on the west coast main line. I have to tell him that, only last week, some of his colleagues spoke on my local radio station, criticising the Government for their failure to bring about the necessary improvements to the west coast main line. It is clear that when we leave rail planning to Railtrack and the train operators—at present, British Rail—it is very different from the policy of the rest of Europe, where there are government-backed rail development plans. Again, we judge road and public transport proposals on a completely different basis from the rest of Europe. Until we can judge one strategic route against another, on a level playing field, we cannot be confident that the Government are proceeding with the right negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all that is added to the Treasury's additionality rule, under which any money from Europe cannot be added to overall public spending, we get results that show that road projects are included in the plans because we have a roads programme—that public spending is already committed—but, as I am sure the hon. Member for St. Ives will discover, rail projects are vetoed because there is no government-backed rail programme. Any Euro-spending or even any Government support for upgrading the European rail network would be added to public spending. The only exceptions are the ones that we have heard about this morning from the Minister in respect of the channel tunnel rail link and the west coast main line, which is based on the assumption of private backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that we have funding and commitment at a national level that will give us a truly coherent and integrated transport strategy. I do not see how the proposals we are discussing today, and the Government's proposals which are based so heavily on roads, will increase prosperity. I am not satisfied by the Government's assurances about how seriously they will take environmental considerations. Far more needs to be done to integrate the different modes of transport. I do not have any confidence that as a result of the proposals, we will end up with improved prosperity or any environmental gains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.42 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley), I have confidence in my hon. Friend the Minister for Roads and Traffic and in the Department which he represents. His short speech at the start of the debate was admirable in its brevity and in its concentration on the important issues of financing and the danger of documents such as these.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment on some of the hon. Lady's remarks. We have always heard from the Opposition about the need for an integrated transport system. That has been one of their recurrent themes. There was, for example, the Transport Act 1968, introduced by Baroness Castle, which was based on the theme of an integrated transport system. In those days, the Opposition wanted compulsory integration, and we all know that it did not work. We can all say, "Yes, we are in favour of an
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
integrated transport system"—whatever that might mean—but what matters is how it is brought about. That subject divides members of the Committee along party lines. I am doubtful about the way in which some Opposition Members suggest that integration can be achieved, however excellent an aim that is. However, the debate has been useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we began, I wondered about the value of these documents, but the fact that the opportunity to ask questions has been fully used and that many hon. Members have been jumping to their feet shows the interest and the concern surrounding the issue. I should have liked to ask many more questions on a subject, for example, of great interest to me and to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North—sea transport. The proposals on page 30 of the document are for increased European measures relating to goods carried by sea. I have doubts about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) referred to the competence of the Commission. I agree with him that the Commission is constantly trying to build on the competence that it has been given and to make it into something greater. Here, we have another example: the references in the report to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Information and vessel traffic management network for European waters".</p></blockquote>
What worries me is what the relationship really is between a member state, the European Community and the international organisations—in this case, the International Maritime Organisation, of which I am something of a fan and which, as I said in the House on Friday, is a very workmanlike organisation. We are in dreadful danger of the European Community coming between a member state and, in this case, the International Maritime Organisation with schemes of its own. I wonder how they will all dovetail together and whether there is a danger of duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main concern about this and other such long-scale documents—one which is frequently expressed by members of the Committee, especially by my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), with whom I often make common cause on this matter—is that although one cannot necessarily argue against their aims and objectives, one's suspicions are aroused about what the Commission is really up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I went to the European Parliament 15 years ago with the right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor), I was dismissive of reports, especially of those that we were getting during that stage of the development of the European Community. They seemed to be a lot of waffle. However, I quickly learned that definite proposals and, more importantly, very big bills for the European taxpayer can come from waffle. That is what this is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was a member of the transport committee, the burning ambition of many Members of the European Parliament and of the Commission was to have a fully fledged transport policy for the European Community, by which they meant a fully funded transport policy, which would override what member states were doing. Although these documents are admirable in their way—they point
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
out some obvious things, and one cannot argue with them—their real purpose is to establish a transport fund for the Community, in addition to those funds that are referred to in the document, such as the European regional development fund and the cohesion funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced by my hon. Friend the Minister's insistence that it is unlikely that there will be new financial institutions. If I can draw again on the nearly five years that I spent in the European Parliament, such documents become the basis of the case for establishing new financial instruments. The Commission endorsed this document, and it will become a brick with which to build a case for a fully fledged transport fund. Of itself, that might be a good thing, and my part of the world might benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One's attitude to such matters, of course, depends on the constituency that one represents. I am keen on certain aspects of regional policy because my part of the world, being in a peripheral area of the country, can and does benefit to an extent. However, there are dangers here, and I touched on them in my questions to my hon. Friend the Minister. The most obvious one, which he mentioned—that is why I welcomed his opening remarks—is the danger that Britain, as one of the two big net contributors to European funding, will find itself paying out even more money for schemes across the European Union that member states, perhaps, should be financing themselves. Exercises and documents such as these will result in us handing on to our taxpayers a further, massive increase in the amount that we make over to the Union without having real control over what it is spent on. That is my fear, put simply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister is taking a rightly robust attitude to this issue. We must stick to the line that he detailed in his opening speech and I hope that that message goes to the Government. I have no hesitation in backing the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document is incoherent, incompetent and fundamentally politically flawed, not least because it epitomises, for me, some of the problems with the present Commission's attitude towards transport. It is exceedingly muddled, its English, frankly, is appalling and I think that it is illiterate. For example, it states that key elements for transport are
	<br><blockquote><p>"the intermodal nodes of the network".</p></blockquote>
I am basically a council school girl. I thought that I might have got something wrong, so I looked up the word "node". Surprise, surprise, a node is the part of a plant system from which one or more leaves emerge, a knob on a root or a branch, a natural swelling or a bulge in an organ, either of two points at which a planet's orbit intersects, a point of minimum disturbance in a standing wave system, a point of zero current, a point at which a curve intersects itself, a vertex in a graph, or a component in a computer network. At no point did the dictionary mention anything that even vaguely resembled the rubbish in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is worrying. If one reads it carefully, it becomes clear that the Commission intends to pursue
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
certain lines of policy which could be exceedingly dangerous. First, it talks about the implementation of many European systems which would be both expensive and, certainly at the moment, experimental. The Minister did not mention the clear emphasis on traffic management schemes in detail, as I should have liked him to do, and he certainly did not talk about the suggestion that there should be satellite control. Satellite control systems are very expensive and can be justified only if they are properly supervised and can produce positive benefits. To use them at sea is a perfectly sensible development; but in relation to the movement of lorries, I have considerable reservations about whether their use could be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document also makes it clear that the Commission would expect to be able to specify what it would regard as projects of Community interest. In the list of projects that are to be carried out in the next five of 10 years, whether it is railway links, inland water links or road links, British projects are so marginalised as to be of no importance whatever. The section that relates to airports and air traffic control systems could have considerable implications for the United Kingdom, yet, although we know that new air traffic control systems are being developed in this country and although an en route system is being put into operation here as well, there is no suggestion that the Community either understands or accepts the real problems of harmonising, modernising and investing in such highly essential systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere is the cost or the control of the various developments spelt out in any detail. I am glad that the Minister said that he had discovered what the 2A committee was and that he wanted it to be a 3B. He must have a deep involvement in his scholastic background to realise that 3B was usually the most dangerous and the most anti-social of the classes. That is presumably why he hopes to make some movement towards that magic nember. But the reality is that unless we know what type of control measures exist on all of the schemes, we cannot understand whether they will be properly evaluated. The Document talks about evaluation not in terms of benefit for the consumer, but to check whether the schemes are helping towards the integration of Europe. Frankly, transport schemes ought to be evaluated in relation to their efficiency in the movement of goods and of people and, if need be, their environmental cost. Those are not spelt out in the document and there is no suggestion that the Commission has thought about the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say that as one reads through the document, one discovers many vague phrases which could be taken to mean almost anything. On research and development, the document mentions a
	<br><blockquote><p>"specific programme with a volume of ca ECU 240 million … for the further development of the trans-European network for transport. In particular the strategic research will cover forecasting, modelling and scenarios on a European level".</p></blockquote>
That budget is very large and would have direct implications for all aspects of transport, but so far, it has not been spelt out how that would be controlled, what it would do, who would have the decision-making powers and what implication there would be for taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I was also surprised that the Minister did not recognise that there were clear statements in the document that powerlines would be involved in European planning. That is mentioned several times. Powerlines and the implications for transport in general are clearly explained as one of the interests of a trans-national set-up. What safeguards, what guidelines and what protection do we have in controlling our own planning processes? I know that my hon. Friend is concerned about the environment, but if we do not control power, we will have very little control over our future economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various hon. Members have spoken about the implications of the absurd maps which are slung in at the back of the documents. Those of us who are interested in the rail system are horrified that sufficient emphasis is not given to the links in the United Kingdom itself. Why is it not obvious that the rail links between London and the west coast line through Crewe and Northern Ireland of through Stranraer and Northern Ireland are not central to the planning systems? After all, the movement of goods for the whole of the United Kingdom includes the movement of goods from Northern Ireland through the mainland and on to its markets. It is essential that that is clearly spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document talks about multi-modal concepts, but it never makes it clear what sort of research and development is going into planning those, what priority is given to the national state's own programmes, or what is meant by a frame of reference for the development of systems for managing traffic control. At one point it states that only one system is in existence. I must say that much of the document reads like a rather subtle publicity document for some European firms who want to push their own control systems for transport. That does not make me particularly cheerful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Community's opinion of travellers is very clear. I suppose that it is just an accident that the document states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The operation of the trans-European network … will maintain the freedom of the user to make his own choice as to:
	<br><blockquote><p>— which path in the network he will take;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>— what type of services should be allocated;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>— which and how many modes he wishes to use;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>— what his time scales are;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>— what price he is willing to pay".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
So now we know: no one uses transport except males.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can joke about it, but it is worrying that the Government have not answered the questions posed by the Select Committee on European Legislation on 29 June 1994. They are relevant questions. How do the Government foresee the development of intermodal units? That includes telecommunications and energy links, which the Minister has not mentioned at all. How will the links be financed? Should the Government or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
private sector be expected to take the initiative in planning? What categories of projects are likely to meet the criteria? Finally, and most importantly, what are the arrangements for the proper evaluation, monitoring and appraisal of projects, and what measures exist to cover loss of finance through fraud and negligence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is all-embracing, muddled, incoherent and unacceptable. The Minister should say that the lack of specific measures is extremely worrying. The document does not encourage European planning, or spell out the need for efficient rail links or for the support of modern rail systems. It does not offer proper planning measures for air traffic control; nor does it describe road systems that would be truly transnational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were Portuguese, I should consider the document bizarre. It talks about north-south links but never mentions those links between Portugal and Spain that are vital for Portugal. That is typical of the document in general. All its links run in the wrong direction. Unless it was drawn up by a drunk, I can only assume that the document is a great joke. The fact that we are not discussing it on 1 April only means that the Commission has got its dates wrong, as usual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be prepared to answer some of the implications of the nasties hidden in the document. The House of Commons should not let them go without comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complicated document. We should place on record our appreciation of the Minister's efforts to respond to questions, some of which were very localised and detailed. However, this Committee gives hon. Members one of their few opportunities to ask detailed questions about European Community proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's proposal that we "take note" of the documents alarms me. We can take note of them, but it must be understood that that does not mean that we approve of them. Many errors have been pointed out already, and I should not be happy if I were taken to have approved the maps that we have studied simply because I am taking note of the documentation presented by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know that the main anxiety about Europe in Northern Ireland, of which I am the sole representative on the Committee today, relates to the improvement of our links through Scotland into Europe. That link has been vital for Ulster people for centuries, and remains so. The ferry system from Lame to Stranraer and the forthcoming electricity and gas links between Ulster and Scotland are simply the most modern examples of what has happened for centuries. I place on record my appreciation of the comments of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, who clearly recognises the importance of the links from Northern Ireland to Liverpool and to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that the maps are inadequate. The Committee deserves better from the European
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Commission. We need more detailed maps that we can read. We are talking in the dark when we mention hatched lines and solid lines and when we have to ensure that we all know to which page we are referring. It is confusing. To that extent, I cannot approve the motion under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the idea of trans-European networks for many railway and road systems, ports and airports and energy systems. In the context of the island of Ireland's links with Great Britain, much of the document makes sense. However, I am alarmed by some aspects of public expenditure—on road projects, for example. If the Commission recommends certain road projects, which are later approved by the Transport Council, those projects will attract Community funding. Therefore, the Government in office will be tempted to give priority to those road projects, to the disadvantage of more local road projects, which are probably more important to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give the example from my constituency of Saintfield road, which goes into Belfast. Obviously, that is not a trans-European road, yet it attracts 50,000 vehicles a day. The road to Dublin attracts one sixth of that—8,000 vehicles a day. If the road to Dublin was given priority in the trans-European network, whereas the Saintfield road to Belfast was not, the Government could obtain funding from Europe to finance the road to Dublin, but would receive no funding to finance the road into Belfast, which is six times more important. If their road, which is six times busier, was deemed less important than a road to Dublin simply because the Commission recommended the road to Dublin, thousands of my constituents would be screaming mad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Government to tell us how road schemes will be promoted if European funding goes toward European network roads, but not to more important roads in the localities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich mentioned energy. The document refers to gas and electricity links, but not to the electricity link between Scotland and Northern Ireland that is now under way—a public inquiry may report in a month's time—or to the natural gas links between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Government have committed themselves to the two projects to which the European Community has announced that it will contribute substantially. If the European Community is committed to financing those two energy links, why are not they mentioned in the documents before us this morning?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention one other project. I do not expect the Minister to reply this morning. I have not given him advance notice of the point and I do not expect him to know individual roads in Northern Ireland. The important A26 route from Ballymena to Antrim covers a fast-growing area north of Belfast. It is a much more important road for Northern Ireland industry than many other routes that have been mentioned in the island of Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider a road scheme, we should take into account vehicle density, which is already high on that A26
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
route, the impact on the wider community in that area, and the environmental impact. Only a month ago that route became the main route to a new £60 million area regional hospital, which was opened by the Prince of Wales last week. Furthermore, it is the main route for tourists from Scotland going to the north coast resorts in Northern Ireland. It is vital to the economy of Northern Ireland and much more important than some other routes that have been mentioned, yet it is not on the maps. Some people may argue that it is not a European route, but it is because it connects with the motorway—which I can assure hon. Members exists, albeit obliterated on these maps—and it links with Larne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gateway from Larne to Stranraer is selected by the people of Scotland and of Northern Ireland. Market forces have selected that route as the main link between the whole of the island of Ireland and Great Britain. It is the busiest route between the island of Ireland and Great Britain. A third of the freight from the Republic of Ireland now goes through Larne to Stranraer. Larne is the second largest ferry port in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the European context, I stress the importance of the Government always giving priority to road, rail and other connections between Scotland and Northern Ireland through the link from Larne to the west coast of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lidington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I preface my remarks of substance with two minor points that I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will take on board. The right hon. Member for Strangford drew attention to these wretched maps. The Minister knows about the confusion and the strong feeling in Buckingham last year caused by the maps for the then proposed east-west trunk route. I hope that he and his officials will be able to take action to ensure that any maps provided in future are more accurate than those that we have before us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will confirm that any projects designated under the TENs proposals will be subject to full environmental impact assessments and to the planning controls of the member states concerned. Just because a project has been designated as a TEN, those environmental safeguards should not be bypassed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I want to say is very much along the lines already adumbrated by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives and the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. I welcome the objective of trans-European networks. I readily concede that it makes sense in the context of a single market to consider ways in which to co-ordinate transport links so that freight and passenger traffic can move freely across national frontiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share many of the criticisms voiced by other members of the Committee. I am concerned about the apparent lack of economic stringency in the criteria to be applied. The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich alluded to the powers given to the Commission in the draft articles to designate projects. The Commission has the sole right of initiative to make legislative proposals on TENS. It will no doubt take account of the provisions in the treaty on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
importance of encouraging cohesion between different parts of the Community. As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives described, the Commission, backed by other member states, may say in a couple of years, "The Council has signed up to this in principle and now we need the political will and the money to enable these projects to go forward as you all agreed." We must bear that risk in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concerns were heightened when I examined how the Commission intended to translate the declaration of principle in the main document into precise legislative proposals: that is the draft directive on interoperability. The term "interoperability" crops up several times in the Commission's proposal on TENs. On page 38 of the document, interoperability is cited as one of the key criteria for determining whether a project should count as part of a trans-European transport network. The proposals on interoperability in the draft directive show the Commission's institutional appetite. Page 64 of the draft Council directive says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Voluntary standardization by those involved and the mutual recognition of national regulations cannot be contemplated. The absence of both a common regulatory philosophy and of common criteria does not enable a European network and an open, competitive market to be set up without prior definition of essential requirements and basic parameters."</p></blockquote>
In the document, interoperability encompasses infrastructure, energy, maintenance, signalling control-command in the context of the interoperability of railways, rolling stock, environment, operation and users. It is pretty all-embracing stuff. Despite my hon. Friend the Minister's optimistic view that we are winning support from other member states for our approach to trans-national transport policy, I remain very suspicious about the Commission's medium and long-term objectives and its determination through legislation to enhance Community competence on transport on the back of this generalised document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that my hon. Friend felt unable to talk in detail about interoperability. It is the clearest example yet of how the Commission intends to translate this general statement of principle into precise effect. I accept that we shall have the chance in the autumn to consider this matter in greater detail, but can my hon. Friend the Minister tell us whether there has been any change since the Department submitted the explanatory memorandum on 13 June? Commenting on an EC document published on 15 April, the Department of Transport said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The intended scope of the Directive is at present uncertain".</p></blockquote>
The directive is full of jargon and its language is even more opaque than the statement of principles that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich rightly criticised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the general document and the precise proposals on interoperability that ideas for a trans-European transport network, however desirable in principle, carry with them the risk of very high costs, which might fall on governments or on transport operators. I fear that what happened to the steel industry may happen to
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
transport: the British Government's emphasis on privatisation and bringing the private sector into the operation of businesses which, in most other European countries, are still the province of the state may leave us in a minority when it comes to discussing European proposals. Our industries may end up at a disadvantage.

In the explanatory memorandum on the interoperability of rail services, the Department envisages that, depending on how the directive is eventually interpreted, substantial additional costs might be imposed on private train operators or track operators. In some other countries, that would mean an extra burden on the taxpayer. Since rail privatisation in Britain, such interoperability proposals would clearly have an impact on the viability of franchisees, on Railtrack or on the track charges that Railtrack was making to franchise operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a similar concern about air traffic control. On page 45, we see that the Commission is looking forward to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the harmonization of facilities and procedures so as to integrate the various service providers"</p></blockquote>
—that is, the service providers of the different member states—
	<br><blockquote><p>"into a unified system."</p></blockquote>
I find it difficult to see how that sits easily with the Government's present readiness to consider the privatisation of the national air traffic control network. So I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can tell the Committee how the Government's thinking is developing on those matters. I hope that he is right in his assessment that we can expect significant support from other member states for our approach on this area of policy, but I think that that is an issue which members of the Committee and Members of the House will wish to keep under fairly close scrutiny. I remain distrustful of the institutional ambitions of the Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister handled his brief well; he had obviously taken trouble to get to know the material. I hope it does him some good in the reshuffle this week—of course, he may have been cramming for the exam, knowing that he was about to be judged, although it may be too late. They say it is better to compliment hon. Members on the other side, because if one compliments one's hon. Friends, one is accused of looking for advancement.

My hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich talked about how the language of the document was biased in favour of the male sex. I am reminded of the note attached to Scottish education department documents on primary schools, saying that throughout the document the headteacher would always be referred to as "he" and the class teacher as "she", and that that was not meant to be offensive. I do not know how they thought it would not be offensive. I give the example to show how sexist the language of all Governments is. I was pleased that the right hon. Member for Strangford mentioned Antrim; the roads from Belfast up to Antrim are terrible.

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
The document is like a sweetshop for the Minister and the Government: it is all about the European road network and the European rail network. The Government have given us no indication in this noting motion that they have taken into account anything that the Select Committee in the other place said. There are obviously much larger considerations; the Government should make choices and should tell the European Parliament what they think of the documents, not just acknowledge their existence. The Government may like having an array of sweets from which they can pick and choose or, in the case of many projects, leave on the shelf. From what I have seen recently in my own constituency and throughout Scotland, the bias towards roads is now going to a nonsensical length. For example, they have allowed ScotRail to close the Fort William depot, which means that all the petrochemicals running into the west coast of Scotland now go in by tanker. This means in turn that the roads up to Fort William will now be packed with tourists queuing behind 40 or 50 lorries. Anyone contemplating a European road and rail network should tackle that question—not just high speed trains or road networks. There has been indications that one of the petrochemical companies in Grangemouth—perhaps Shell—was closing the depot in Glasgow so that nothing would go by rail to Bishopriggs before being distributed to the west coast. It will run out of Grangemouth by road, vastly increasing the traffic out of Grangemouth along the M9 and the A76. That is ridiculous. The Government and the European Community should be addressing the movement of freight and people and dealing with the impact on transport, the economy and the individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not satisfy me in respect of the time scales for the Eurotunnel link. He should feel great embarrassment when we are compared with our European partners. The Government have not been very helpful to the people who put together the Eurotunnel project in the private sector. I am a supporter of the concept and thank goodness that they stuck with it and refinanced and refinanced without great assistance from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are not many warm words from people in the private sector about their relationship with the Government during the period when they struggled to put the project on the ground. The Government talked it up, got all the publicity and then walked away and left the private sector to sweat it out. We believe private sector investment is very important to transport networks and, given our new statement of policies, we will not do such things to the private sector. We will be much more involved with the private sector and will participate much more than the Government when we come to power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went with the Eurotunnel people to look at the TGV at 	<i>Euralille.</i> In the beginning it was said that there would be a massive investment in a huge transport interchange for Eurotunnel—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I recognise the electrical definition having studied physics at school, but I did not think that it had anything to do with transport. The Euralille node was a £600 million investment and two and a half or three years
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
ago I saw a hole in the ground and a set of plans. I returned six months ago and saw a seven-line track, including a link with the local train network and the local mongy, a rail-bound bus system, like a trolley bus on rails—I cannot remember what we call it in this country. The local people thus had some benefit from the huge trans-European railway network which was almost completed in a two-year period. Infrastructure including hotels, shopping centres and offices is now being built above the railway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that there would be a link through Kent to the Ashford international station two and a half to three years ago. Six months ago there was nothing there except a couple of sticks in a field and two dumper trucks. It worries me when the Minister tells us about the time scale. When the directive is implemented in other countries, which are more reasonable about carrying out projects that they say they will undertake, they will get on the bandwagon. Despite other hon. Members saying that they do not like the idea of money going to Europe and then being redistributed for other projects—they call it British money but it is European money—that is what will happen. We will be left out because the Government talk up a plan and then throw it to the private sector without participating properly. The time scale therefore becomes elongated and we are excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were to say that the Government would be arguing with the European Community that despite the document we want the large transport project reassessed and put back into the system, he would find a lot of support. I am reminded of housing benefit applicants who apply, having missed the benefit because they did not know what was needed, and being told, "Well, you didn't apply six months ago so the six month benefit that you did not get cannot be given to you." That is what is happening in this case. There are projects which Ministers say will happen, and because that is said and because the projects are in the planning stages they will not be eligible for any funds that accompany the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the project for the west-coast line should be on the ground and running by 1995, but the project is on the wish list, it is an aspiration which may not come about. I am worried that in view of what the Minister says about the directive should the time scale elongate, we will be unable to go back to Europe and ask for money to fund that important project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project is very important to the people of Scotland. The west-coast line is fundamental to the future economy of Scotland, and the Minister should ensure that it receives any available money from Europe. Just to note the documents, without any suggestion that we will fight to put those projects back into the melting pot and demand finance, is very sad indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone should tell the people at ScotRail that, according to the map, the Inverness to Glasgow and Edinburgh line is a European CT line and not a conventional line. But ScotRail has said that people in Scotland are worried that it does not regard the Inverness line as important. The Aberdeen line is marked as a conventional line, yet ScotRail envisages making most money from that line because of North sea oil. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
excellent that the EC regards the line to Inverness as important, but the line to Aberdeen is equally important, and we should not have to choose between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of what was said by the first Scottish Nationalist party Member of Parliament, who eventually became the Provost of Stirling and was finally put out of office when the Labour party took over the council. He used to say that, in the 1950s, the most significant sight at the Scottish border was a sign saying not "Scotland" but "beware of the sheep". Considering what has happened to the Conservative party in Scotland since 1951, when it received a majority of votes, we should still beware of the sheep and the Committee should consider what I have said about the needs of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and, at times, exciting debate. Considering that, only last night, a member of the Committee opined to me that he did not expect today's proceedings to last more than one hour, we have done well. I always enjoy appearing before the Committee, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Falkirk, East for his kind remarks. The tragedy is that the Committee is unwhipped, so the hon. Gentleman's message will not be conveyed to quarters where it might do me some good. That's life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the remarks of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East about the fortunes of the Conservative party in Scotland, if we considered the votes cast in total in Scotland, the losers would be members of a party that is not represented on the Committee —the Liberal Democrats. Perhaps we should draw a veil over that. The hon. Gentleman referred also to the Select Committee in another place, to which we shall respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not consider that the proposals before the Committee represent a pick 'n mix sweet stall. That is something that we must keep out fingers off. As the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich will recognise, this is not only a sexist world—I find it a sizeist world, too, and the concept of sweet stalls is difficult for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the hon. Member for Falkirk, East that I understand the Scottish dimension. Indeed, my first job was in Scotland. I lived in Musselburgh and I learnt the importance of being on what is regarded as the periphery of Europe—although some would say that that was a good thing and that some people who live a long way from the south-east should consider themselves lucky.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all embarrassed about discussing the channel tunnel rail link. The first link to Waterloo will cope well with the projected demand into the beginning of next century. I look forward to using that system. The new terminus at Waterloo is a fine terminus, which will attract much custom. It is not that the French have always got it right. I know that, when we visit other nations, the grass appears greener on the other side of the fence—or, in this case, the channel—but that is not so. The investment that has been put into the four core terminals in this country—in Willesden, Trafford Park, Birmingham and Moss
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
End—is remarkable, and I anticipate great demand for their services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are really talking about is risk sharing between the public and private sectors. We lead the way in Europe on private finance initiatives in transport. It is also important to remember that out statutory processes and public consultation processes are perhaps a little more sensitive and drawn out than those in other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that plans will be announced later today for 700 redundancies among the very people who carry out the public inquiries that the Minister has just said are the envy of the rest of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only is that nothing to do with this debate, but I never comment on leaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to continue to answer the point of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East. I am asking for the Committee's support for our approach to this document. The Government consider that there is no reason to suggest that existing sources of finance for the Thames are inadequate. As I said earlier, we have structural funds, cohesion funds and the new Thames budget heading, which comes under the European Commission's grant support system. In addition, there are the European investment bank loans and the European investment fund guarantee systems. However, by far the most important source of finance will continue to be member state public sector investment and the private sector contributions to it. Therefore, it is a question of identifying a financing gap. That must be demonstrated before we can even consider new instruments. In any case, Commission borrowing should not, in my view, be one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we are at one in agreeing to continue to reject the concept of new instruments for financing these projects, and I hope that the Committee will support me on that. The purpose of the proposal is to identify routes and projects of Community interest which should be considered for funding at Community level. It does not seek to identify and prioritise projects of national or local importance. Those should continue to be funded at national level. It must not be forgotten that we are net contributors to the Community budget. Additional Community funding of national priority projects would inevitably lead to further calls on our Exchequer. Again, we are at one on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me now deal with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury. Calais may be written on the hearts of some people, but it is the east-west route that is written on mine, not to mention Aston Clinton, which is just down the road and still occupies a good deal of my time. Several members of the Committee have commented on the inadequacy of the maps, and I think that a few lessons from the Ordnance Survey would not go amiss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure my hon. Friend that there will be full environmental impact assessments for any of these town routes. There is not question of any favourable treatment for them in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has referred to a commitment to environmental impact assessments. Does he agree that strategic environmental assessment will become increasingly important? The whole route is considered, not just one part of it, and that is then compared with other available options. Will the Minister give a commitment to introduce stategic environmental assessment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Lady is catching up with Government policy in this area. That is exactly what the Government announced with regard to Aylesbury many months ago; I am surprised that the hon. Lady did not recognise it at the time. We have already done what she suggests, and it has been broadly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. friend the Member for Aylesbury mentioned interoperability. There are significant differences between the infrastructures, power supplies and rolling stock of the European railways, for example, and they can be an impediment. However, the proposal goes beyond what is strictly necessary to ensure the safe and efficient operation of through trains in the network, and the costs of implementation may outweigh the benefits. Those elements will be challenged in the European Council working group discussions. Until the scope of the directive is clear that will be difficult to judge; however, the costs could be substantial, which is why I am deeply sceptical. The scope may become clearer after the orientation debate scheduled for the November 1994 Transport Council, to which I have already referred. Other member states, including Germany—which currently holds the presidency—share our concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Strangford paid me some delightful compliments, for which I am grateful. I do not suppose for one moment that the right hon. Gentleman approves of the document; nor do I. I have already expressed my anxieties. I do not approve of the maps, which are inadequate. I appreciate the importance of links through Scotland and into England. The right hon. Gentleman emphasised that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties of prioritising road projects is that we are discussing routes that have European significance. The motorway and trunk road system, for which I am responsible,—my responsibility is only for English roads—takes up 5 per cent. of total road mileage, while local roads are responsible for the other 95 per cent. The right hon. Gentleman asked about the relationship between trunk roads and non-trunk roads, and those for which local goverment is responsible and those which central Government look after. In England, we constantly examine the relationship between trunking and de-trunking. That has implications, in terms of who pays, for local authorities in England. However, there are greater implications, for example, as the right hon. Gentleman suggested, that some roads that are regarded as having only local significance can carry much more traffic than those thay may be designated of national or international importance. I am sensitive to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted the right hon. Gentleman's point about the A26 Ballymena to Antrim road and its importance not only for industry and the hospital, but for tourism. I shall draw his
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
comments to the attention of my ministerial colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to clear up the point about the energy guidelines. A separate document exists for energy guidelines. We are considering the transport document today. The energy guidelines were discussed in the Energy Council in May. However, there is no agreed energy project for the subject that we are discussing yet. The Department of Trade and Industry is in the lead. I undertake to ask my ministerial colleagues to clear up the matter. I do not know the number of the explanatory memorandum that covers energy. We are considering the transport network, not the energy network this morning. However, there is a matter to do with pipelines that is not clear. I am sure that we shall deal with that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a broad and wide-ranging speech, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich was rightly worried about the genesis of the operation. I am not as worried as the hon. Lady about ghastly jargon, such as "inter-modal nodes". To me inter-modal nodes mean railway or bus stations, or perhaps park-and-ride. However, I understand the hon. Lady's agnosticism when confronted with such esoteric terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady discussed lorries and how they might be fitted with satellite up-links. She will not have dealt with such a problem, which is a matter for lorry owners and operators. Production is geared to just-in-time principles. The length of journey is not as important as its predictability. The highly sophisticated, expensive system that the hon. Lady mentioned could be important. However, I agree with the hon. Lady that we are considering benefit to the consumer. As we progress, I shall remain very aware of that. I reassure her that the United Kingdom is calling for strong value-for-money and financial control provisions to ensure that British taxpayers' money is spent wisely and in accordance with the wording that we won from the cohesion fund regulations. The Committee has already debated those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the support of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives. From personal experience of his constituency, I recognise his concerns about sea transport and ports. He asked whether we were taking a robust line on ports, and the answer is yes. We are willing to explore the role of ports and any gaps in the provision of ports, but we are reluctant to seek European money that will distort competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the projects notified to the Department of Transport that met the criteria set by the member states group were considered. Initially, there were 140 proposals from 53 United Kingdom ports. Subsequent modifications of the criteria by the Commission led to the inclusion of 17 projects and 10 feasibility studies in a provisional list of projects of common interest. We do not consider that list closed. The Department will put forward to Brussels any additional projects that are offered, provided that they appear to meet the criteria, but I must report that the Commission appears to have shelved the list of projects of common interest and is currently considering how it might take the work forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
The member states group pressed the European Commission to accept that ports and the projects were of importance in Europe, whether or not they lay on the networks developed for other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives also said that west Cornwall, and Cornwall in general, felt peripheral to all those activities, but Cornwall is no more peripheral to Europe than the north-west or the north-east. I am well aware of that, as I lived in Cornwall for some years. I hope that people in Cornwall are not implying that they would rather live in the south-east, because they enjoy many advantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that concern has been expressed because the trans-European road network does not extend down the A30 into Cornwall nor indeed beyond Plymouth on the A38. The reason for that is straightforward. It is not, as one or two rather extraordinary comments from the Liberal Democrats have implied, that the Government think that Europe stops at the Tamar—some Cornish nationalists may, but the Government do not. It is simply that Plymouth is a port of growing international significance and the trans-European road network is designed to reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that we have been able to continue to invest in roads in the south-west. The setting up of the integrated regional office in Plymouth will ensure that the Government are aware of the importance of the south-west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) said much about environmental issues. As I have said, the habitats directive will be discussed in the Chamber tonight, and we shall reply to the Select Committee of the other place in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem, because we were told that the Labour party had published its environmental policy and that the Government's transport policy was "all about road building". I wonder whether the hon. Lady ever talks to Labour councillors in her constituency, some of whom came to see me in a delegation last week. What did they want? Did they want railways, trams or canals? Of course not. They wanted roads, lots of roads, more roads, bigger roads and quicker roads. That is what the Labour councillors of Stoke-on-Trent want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear many witterings from the Labour party about environmental concerns, but I wonder whether they ever stop to think about the impact of their policies on their constituents' quality of life and standard of living and about what their local councillors are fighting for. Now that regional consultative councils—which, I regret to say, are almost exclusively dominated by the Labour party—have been set up, I wonder whether the councillors talk to Labour Members of Parliament or to their electorate who use their cars for work and pleasure to enhance their quality of life, whether that involves sport, drama, leisure or anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to reading the Labour party's document, which sounds old and tired even before its publication.
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Labour Members rabbit on about an integrated transport policy which is all things to all men—or all women, large, small or short. In more than a year of discussing the issue, I have not heard the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North say what she means by an integrated transport policy. It means that if one is talking about roads, one tries to persuade everyone to talk about railways, and that if one is talking about railways, one tries to persuade everyone that roads are important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way. I have listened to quite enough from the hon. Lady for the moment. I shall give way when I have finished what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady talks about lots of dotted lines on maps. Joining up dots is as far as the Labour party has gone to producing a coherent transport policy. It is a dotty policy which will add up to not a lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North talks about the importance of judging one strategic route against another. What on earth does this mean? It says nothing about integrated transport policy. Judging one strategic route against another implies that, in a Labour controlled country, instead of going from Manchester to London, people must go from Manchester to Bristol. That does not sound sensible, and it is not what the hon. Lady meant, but that is how it sounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady talked at length about the lack of Government support for the rail programme. That is interesting considering that investment by the taxpayer in British Rail has been about £6 billion in the past five years and that investment in railways this year will be about £1 billion, of which approximately half will be invested in Railtrack. British Rail and Railtrack will keep up to £200 million of the privatisation proceeds in 1994–95 to supplement planned expenditure. No Government support for the rail programme indeed!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that she accepted two of the recommendations of the Select Committee in another place. What about the other 82 recommendations? We shall return to that matter anon. I shall be delighted to give way to the hon. Lady if she will tell me what she means by an integrated transport policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Walley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like the Minister to tell us when he will bring forward proposals for conventional railway networks as part of the terms that we are discussing. What are his proposals, following his lengthy consulations with British Rail and Railtrack? Perhaps there will be new programmes not for conventional railways but only for a roads programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder where the hon. Lady has been. Only two months ago, the Department of Transport announced its reorganisation plans, which are shortly to be implemented and which are far more meaningful in terms of railways, let alone integrated transport. There will be just two major directorates, one for infrastructure—whether road, rail, ports or airports—and one for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
operations—anything that moves in the system. That is a sensible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady cannot have it both ways. She cannot say that we must concentrate on railways and forget everything else and that we must have an integrated transport plicy. I reiterate that the inadequate maps that enraged the Committee are indicative and will not alter United Kingdom transport programmes and priorities, or impose any commitment on the United Kingdom to extend or upgrade our transport networks. However, the Government will ensure that there is sufficient coverage of United Kingdom routes on the maps so that our projects can benefit fully from any Community financing available for trans-European networks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue to emphasise the important role played by the private sector in the financing and operation of transport systems in the United Kingdom, and I hope that hon. Members will agree that that approach is right. I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
