	<div class='title'>SCHOOLS FUNDING COUNCIL FOR WALES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 1, line 27, at beginning insert

	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) This section has effect when not less than 20 per cent. of the pupils for whom education is provided in county, voluntary and grant-maintained schools in Wales are registered pupils at grant-maintained schools.'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not anticipated that we would reach clause 2 so quickly this morning. It gives us the opportunity to study some of the most important aspects of the Bill that affect the Principality. I am delighted to see that the Minister of State has returned from Milan, where he was at the weekend, and I hope that he has brought back some jobs for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendments Nos. 30 and 31, the Welsh funding council would be set up only when 20 per cent. of Welsh pupils are in grant-maintained schools. There are three reasons for that. First, it is important to avoid the unnecessary cost and bureaucracy of setting up a funding council for Wales when few schools have become grant-maintained. The Committee will be aware that the history of the Welsh aspect goes back several months, when the Government's original intention was for grant-maintained schools to be funded and administered not by a schools funding council, but by the existing Further Education Funding Council for Wales—at this stage, it might be appropriate for me to declare my own interest as a consultant to the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
People in the education circles in Wales believed that the Further Education Funding Council for Wales would deal with the grant-maintained schools—until the Bill was published. For some reason, the Government changed their mind. Initially, they said that the small handful of schools that had become grant-maintained would be run directly from the Welsh Office, which would not be too difficult as there are only three such schools. Then, the Government said that when sufficient schools—there is no sign of the precise number—in Wales became grant maintained, the schools funding council would be set up in Cardiff to run what the Government believe will be an increasing number of grant-maintained schools in the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on the sittings motion, I said that we should examine carefully the setting up of the funding council because of local government re-organisation in Wales. The Secretary of State for Wales has adopted a different stance from that of his English counterpart. We are told that he proposes introducing a White Paper between now and January 1993 on the structure and future of local government in the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, leaked documents from the Welsh Office—a matter on which the Minister is not prepared to comment but which is of interest to the Committee—came to the notice of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan). The documents, which seemed genuine to me, revealed that the Government are considering the establishment of 24 rather than 23 unitary authorities for Wales. So far as we are aware, they will be local education authorities; at present there are only eight authorities in the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not yet know what education function those councils will have. We are told that some, the larger ones—say, Cardiff, Newport and Swansea—will be called lead authorities. They will take the lead—presumably in different advisory services—in the support services that the LEAs now administer. The other, smaller councils, apparently will not have those functions. While all this is in the melting pot, so to speak, it seems insane for the schools funding council for Wales to be established without our knowing precisely what the pattern of local government in Wales is likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government were to accept the amendment, it would be convenient to wait until 20 per cent. of Welsh pupils were in grant-maintained schools before setting up the council. This would enable them to examine closely the implications and impact of local government reorganisation in the Principality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second reason why it is imperative for the Government to rethink is the distinct lack of interest in grant-maintained schools in Wales. We have heard much from the Secretary of State for Education and his junior Ministers about the great upsurge in grant-maintained schools in England. The Minister of State for Wales spoke on Second Reading about the great upsurge in Wales—where there are about 2,117 schools of which three have opted out so far. Two of those decided to opt out because the local authority threatened to close them, acting in response to a specific directive from the Welsh Office to reorganise secondary schools in the county of Gwent to
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
save surplus places and help save some of the £23 million costs, and the 118,000 places. That was a laudable objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the attitude of the LEAs towards grant-maintained schools? Are they in favour, agnostic or opposed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They take notice of what Welsh parents think. The parents are greatly opposed to the idea of opt-out schools. The two in Gwent that opted out—the third is a Catholic comprehensive in West Glamorgan—did so simply because of school reorganisation closure proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flagship of the three was Cwmcarn comprehensive school, which lies in the centre of the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), who was Leader of the Opposition at the time of the grant-maintained opt-out. It would not stretch the imagination to believe that one reason that the Secretary of State allowed the opt-out to go on was that it was happening in that constituency. No other reason would have justified it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office has talked for some years about optimum numbers for schools. If has referred to 800 or 900 pupils in schools for 11 to 16-year-olds being the right size for a comprehensive. The numbers at Cwmcarn school were reduced and it was threatened with closure as a result of the local government reorganisation proposals. The Government should have taken note of that, but they did nothing of the sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cwmcarn school has 323 pupils and only this week I received information produced by the Welsh joint education committee showing that it fared extremely badly in the GCSE examination. We take such statistics with a pinch of salt, but the Government should compare the achievements of Cwmcarn with the three neighbouring schools of Newbridge, Oakdale and Blackwood. By far the worst results were achieved by the comprehensive school that the Government regard as the flagship school in Wales for their policy of opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Cwmcarn had been run down by Gwent local authority for a considerable time before it proposed its closure? Is he also aware that no one was more strongly in favour of the preservation of Cwmcarn than the right hon. Member for Islwyn, in whose constituency the school is located?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am aware of that—indeed, I wrote to the Secretary of State about the reorganisation proposals in Gwent—but it is a separate issue. The then Leader of the Opposition referred to the reorganisation plans of Gwent county council, 80 per cent. of which he and I agreed with, 20 per cent. of which we disagreed with. My right hon. Friend made it quite clear that he did not agree with the subsequent decision by Cwmcarn to opt out of local education authority control. He was completely opposed—as I was—to that method of keeping the school open. We wanted Cwmcarn school and others—such as St. Alban's comprehensive school, which is a Roman Catholic school in my constituency—to be enhanced and improved by the LEA and to survive. As a result of the latter development of Cwmcarn all but one of the original teaching staff have left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must make it absolutely clear to the Committee that he and the right hon. Member for Islwyn were for the preservation of Cwmcarn in the maintained sector but the local education authority would have none of it. Was that the position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. That proves a general point: Opposition Members are not slavish followers of everything that LEAs do, as the Government have always tried to maintain. My relationship with Gwent LEA is very good. As I said, I approved of 80, perhaps 90 per cent. of the reorganisation proposals, but not all of them. It is for me, as far as St. Alban's school is concerned, and for my right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn as far as Cwmcarn is concerned, to put the point of view of those who believe that such schools can exist within the LEA structure. That is worlds apart from schools opting out of LEA control and becoming blighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Cwmcarn is to be used as a flagship for other schools in Wales likely to opt out, then the Minister can say goodbye to all the reorganisation proposals for secondary schools in the Principality, goodbye to saving surplus places, and he can certainly say goodbye to the general level of education in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a wider context, it is important to remember that several schools in Wales have considered opting out and have rejected it. Doubtless, in the months to come, one or two will accept it. The Minister will probably come back to me on the issue of local authorities' capital expenditure, which is not as simple as he pretends. Some schools in Wales will be compelled to become grant-maintained to obtain the money necessary for repairs and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he works closely with Gwent education authority. Does he approve of its conduct since Cwmcarn became grant-maintained? I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of reports that Gwent education authority instructed the schools in its control to have nothing to do with Cwmcarn school and not even to play games against that school. Does the hon. Gentleman approve of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making one-sided points. I approve of the fact that the local education authority knows precisely what the people whom it represents think about opt-out schools. The vast majority of the members of Gwent county council were elected to their office by people who are diametrically opposed to opt-out schools and grants-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That relates to my earlier question to the hon. Gentleman. I asked him if the LEAs were opposed to grant-maintained status, in favour of them or agnostic on the issue. He answered that they would rely on parents' views. That does not square with what the hon. Gentleman has just said. He told us that councillors representing their electorate are clearly opposed to opting out. That means that the LEAs oppose it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) said, it is disgraceful that LEAs instruct schools not to play sport with a school merely because it is grant-maintained. At times, we all take politics to extremes, but it is ridiculous to penalise the kids at other schools because one is grant-maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) responds to that intervention, I remind the Committee that the debate is going rather wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not, therefore, be drawn to respond to the intervention other than to say that members of the LEAs in Wales and of the teaching unions—the Conservative party does not regard the teaching unions with any sense of fairness—and others involved in the academic education world in Wales, including the Welsh joint education committee, which is the finest education institution in the Principality, overwhelmingly rejected the concept of grant-maintained schools at the general election. There are only six Conservative Members of Parliament out of 38 in the Principality. That is no mandate to bring in opting out and grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is one of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one of the six Conservative Members in Wales, I bring the hon. Gentleman back to his earlier point, that the education authorities in Wales do not oppose grant-maintained status, but merely reflect the views of parents. Could he therefore tell us whether parents in Gwent are opposed to children in schools within the LEA playing sport with Cwmcarn school? Is that the view of parents in Gwent? If so, how did the hon. Gentleman come to that conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The inter-sport relationship between schools is not part of the amendment. Would hon. Gentlemen please keep to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I will write to the hon. Gentleman telling him about parents' views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I was merely picking up the hon. Gentleman's point that the LEAs in Wales reflect the views of parents. Gwent authority has a policy of instructing its schools not to play sport with Cwmcarn school. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that that is the view of parents in Gwent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have given a ruling. The Committee can proceed only if it abides by the Standing Orders of the House. Hon. Members must keep to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments refer to the time when 20 per cent. of pupils in Wales will be educated in grant-maintained schools. That figure will never be achieved, but if it were, it would show that the time was right to set up the funding council for Wales. Everybody involved in education in Wales is opposed to setting up that body, except for a small minority and those who will be bribed and intimidated into establishing opted-out schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remains the question of capital spending in the Principality. A few may be tempted by the money involved in opting out. It is wrong for the Minister to give special preference to opted-out and grant-maintained schools in Wales at the expense of the overwhelming majority of local education authority schools. The move towards grant-maintained and opted-out schools in Wales will be pretty slow in the next few months. It will not justify the establishment of a new quango to overview a handful of schools.

	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
The third reason for the amendment's importance is that it would set up another organisation dealing with education planning. In Wales, education is run by the Welsh Office education department and the local education authorities. Under those organisations, governing bodies have been given greater powers—I think that local management of schools is a good thing—but the Bill would mean that education in Wales would be run by local education authorities, the FEFC for Wales, the schools funding council for Wales, the Welsh Office education department, the grant-maintained schools themselves and the education associations that take over so-called failing schools. If that is not a recipe for bureaucratic disaster in the Principality I do not know what is. It is an unnecessary jungle of educational bureaucracy which will not be in pupils' best interests. Not many Conservative Members have spoken about the pupils. The are best served by the local education authorities, which, with the help of the Welsh joint education committee, for many years have provided a first-class education service. That service has been infinitely better than its English counterparts and secondary schools existed in Wales long before there were any in England. The Welsh joint education committee has been sidetracked by the Welsh Office because of its links with local authorities, but it is a very important organisation. Setting up the funding council too early will mean that all the arguments about quangos in Wales will get worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 30 October, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. Redmond) asked the Secretary of State for Wales how many public appointments he had made. The answer filled 42 columns of 	<i>Hansard.</i> The Secretary of State for Wales had appointed nearly 1,000 people in a country that is proud of its democratic background and heritage. The Bill would give the Secretary of State another, premature opportunity to set up a funding council which he will appoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government press release issued in July stated that the people of Wales had
	<br><blockquote><p>"a long, proud and distinguished tradition in education".</p></blockquote>
It boasted that the Government have
	<br><blockquote><p>"a good record in recognising the distinctive needs and historical, cultural and linguistic characteristics of Wales."</p></blockquote>
But the government have ignored the most important tradition in Wales—the democratic tradition. The amendment, which delays the setting up of the funding council, will find favour with those who serve in education and believe in its importance and by all in Wales who oppose the way in which the Government constantly erode our long-established democratic traditions. I hope that the Government and the Minister will respond positively to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have had a short but interesting debate. The hon. Member for Torfaen made it clear that he stood four-square behind the local education authorities and the interests of parents and pupils in Wales were not his prime concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas McAvoy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Rutherglen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen, he said that he did not agree with all decisions taken by all LEAs, despite having a good relationship with them. Surely the Minister heard my hon. Friend say that, and should acknowledge what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It came as a surprise to me, as the hon. Gentleman will have guessed, that the hon. Member for Torfaen was for the preservation of Cwmcarn, the first grant-maintained school to be established in Wales. It was strongly supported by the right hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Kinnock), although he wanted it to remain as a maintained school under the Gwent local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about the consultation paper. It is true that the White Paper proposed that the functions of the funding authority might be undertaken by the Further Education Funding Council for Wales. It was simply because we had economy firmly in our minds that we proposed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper made clear, too, the intention to establish a schools funding council for Wales and that the growth in numbers might be sufficiently rapid for it to be sensible to establish such a body directly. During the consultation process, it was suggested that it would be inconvenient to amend the remit of the Further Education Funding Council for Wales for what might be only a short time. We accepted that it would be neater all round to move directly to the establishment of the schools funding council for Wales, especially given the increased interest expressed in grant-maintained status in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there are at present only three grant-maintained schools but the hon. Gentleman appears to have forgotten that while previously two ballots of parents rejected the proposals, there are now four applications under consideration—two for primary and two for secondary schools. There was a further successful ballot, but we still await an application. I assure the Committee that many inquiries—I have received between 50 and 60—are made by schools in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of accelerating interest in opting out. The Secretary of State has made predictions about the number of schools that will be grant-maintained in England by the end of the financial year and during the two succeeding financial years. Given that the Welsh Office wishes the funding council to be established along similar lines to its English counterpart, have any predictions been made about how many Welsh schools will be grant-maintained by the end of the financial year and during the two succeeding financial years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am hesitant to give forecasts. There are 50 to 60 inquiries in the pipeline. I do not know whether full applications will materialise from them, or whether they will be successful. We must base our plans on the possibility that the grant-maintained sector may grow substantially. That is why the Bill provides for the Welsh Office to supply direct funding to the grant-maintained sector initially, and for the establishment of a schools funding council for Wales if that sector grows substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen mentioned costs. It is difficult to be precise about the costs of the schools funding council. If it has to deal with 20 schools, its costs will be less that if it has to cover 100 schools. There will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
obvious economies of scale. If its costs are limited to making grants, they will be less than if it has to share with local education authorities the duty to secure sufficient school places. That duty is triggered when 10 per cent. of any local authority's pupils become grant-maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also spoke about the local government reorganisation that the Government are considering in Wales. He rightly assumed that I cannot anticipate the contents of the White Paper. However, I can refer the hon. Gentleman to the outline proposals published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales in March when he stated his aim to proceed on the basis of several unitary authorities that will replace district and county councils. I believed that Opposition parties also favoured a unitary authority structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With a Welsh assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So be it. That is the Opposition's clearly stated policy. The Opposition parties are committed to a unitary authority system. I have seen at least one Opposition proposal that anticipates unitary authorities of the same order as we have proposed. The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) nods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think, Mr. Martin, that you would allow me to digress too far, but, the subject being relevant and having been raised, may I say that whatever the number of unitary authorities established in Wales, we see no reason why they should not assume the responsibilities for education that currently rest with the eight county councils? However, let us not pretend that the role of LEAs will remain unchanged, not because of proposals for the reorganisation of local government structures but because of the delegation in recent years of ever more responsibility to schools in the management of their affairs, and on account of the emergence of the grant-maintained sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman share the sentiments of the Secretary of State for Education and the conclusion in the White Paper that
	<br><blockquote><p>"over time all schools will become grant-maintained."?</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Gentleman gives the impression that the matter is an open question in Wales and that he sees LEAs remaining responsible for schools for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the sense that the statement implies that parents decide that schools that their children attend become grant maintained, then naturally I hope that that will happen. The fact that parents decide, by ballot, whether a school shall be grant maintained is, in my view, the ultimate in democracy in education. I know that in that I differ from the hon. Gentleman. Let us be clear—in the context of the school funding council for Wales and the conclusions in the White Paper—that all this depends upon the will of parents in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that when a school has opted out, parents of children there have choice, but that future generations of parents have none?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been over this ground. It is important that parents of children attending school now and voting on whether the schools should be grant maintained or remain in the local authority sector, should have the school of their choice, whenever the ballot takes place. As to future parents and their decisions, the matter is hypothetical and very much an issue for them in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that often the people who decide whether a school opts out eventually cease to be interested because, by the time the procedure is in place, their children are no longer at school, and that people who are directly affected—those whose children are to attend the schools—are rarely consulted, so play no part in the decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Lady. We in Wales anticipate achieving grant-maintained status over a period of six to seven months. In the early stages, perhaps rather longer time was taken, but we shall endeavour to achieve a decision, following a ballot, within six or seven months. Let me return to the main theme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be distracted from the main theme of local government reorganisation and education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next three years there will be a significant transformation in the management and administration of education in Wales because, by 1995, all schools in Wales will have delegated budgets and will assume greater control over their priorities, with LEAs retaining less power at the centre for the provision of services which they think that the schools need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By April 1995, I fully expect a significant number of grant-maintained schools in Wales to exist because that will follow from the further delegation of powers under LMS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that event, the LEAs would have a more diminished role than at present and it would be for them to determine how to fulfil their responsibilities. The same principle would apply to the new unitary authorities, which could pursue several options to meet their responsibilities, including mutual co-operation. They would still have the responsibility for education taken by the county LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the schools funding council for Wales would not be established until at least 20 per cent. of pupils in Wales were in the grant-maintained sector, which is equivalent to about 95,000 pupils. Is the hon. Member for Torfaen suggesting that, until that 20 per cent. were achieved, existing grant-maintained schools would continue to be directly funded from the Welsh Office? If he is, I note his point, but the Opposition have challenged our proposals to establish a council because it would lead to confusion about and duplication of the responsibilities of the LEAs. The amendment is a recipe for chaos and exemplifies the Labour party's muddled thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not had an adequate explanation of how the Opposition have arrived at the magical figure of 20 per cent. nor any indication that they appreciate the full implications of their proposal. The amendment ignores the possibility that the distribution of grant-maintained schools may not be even across Wales. It does not take account of the possible distribution of grant-maintained schools between the primary and secondary sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example of what the 20 per cent. threshold could mean if one linked the primary and secondary sectors. If all pupils in Gwent and Powys, or Gwynedd and Dyfed, attended GM schools, the 20 per cent. threshold would still not be reached. It would be a nonsense to pretend that the LEAs concerned should retain complete responsibility for the provision of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
sufficient school places. I admit that that is an extreme example, but we cannot rule out the uneven distribution of GM schools across Wales and across the primary and secondary sectors. That is why clause 2 does not specify a particular point at which the schools funding council for Wales would be established. We want to examine what pattern emerges in terms of numbers and distribution and then we will decide, on the basis of a sensible assessment, on the need for a council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the schools funding council will be established in response to the wish of parents to have a significant grant-maintained sector in Wales. It will be established only in those circumstances. The target of a precise number of grant-maintained schools has not been set at which the schools funding council will be set up. The establishment of such bodies takes time. We cannot make the council appear at the touch of a button, or say that it will come into being when 17 or 20 schools have become grant-maintained. We shall monitor how many applications are made for grant-maintained status over the next few months and study the pattern that emerges as to location and distribution of those schools among the primary and secondary sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office could retain, in-house, the relatively straightforward function of paying grants to a fair number of schools, but it should not become directly involved in the duty to secure school places if a large proportion of pupils enter the grant-maintained sector in one LEA area. I am sure that Opposition Members will understand that, given the Secretary of State's role in school closures, for example. In those circumstances an earlier establishment of the school funding council would be appropriate, but I expect that by the time the Bill is enacted we shall look to take advantage of the order-making power in clause 2 to begin arrangements for the establishment of the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered the basic points relating to the amendment, and possibly more. If the Opposition choose to press the amendment, I hope that my hon. Friends will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2(1), as drafted, is a recipe for chaos and uncertainty. The amendment's proposal, that a 20 per cent. trigger be adopted, is a reasonably sensible level at which to install a mechanism to establish a schools funding council for Wales, should one prove necessary. The 20 per cent. level could, after discussion, be raised or lowered, but, at the moment, clause 2(1) means that the establishment of the funding council is entirely within the discretion of the Secretary of State. The Minister has said that he would expect that, by the time that the Bill is enacted, it would be appropriate to activate the order to set up that funding council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, there are three grant-maintained schools in Wales. Two chose grant-maintained status when they were under threat of closure by their local authorities, which were trying to carry out the Government's policy and remove surplus places. There have been three further ballots, two of which have been negative and one positive. Four others are in the pipeline, and there have been between 50 and 60 expressions of interest. So, by the time the Bill has completed its passage through Parliament we may have seven such schools if we are lucky. It seems an inappropriate time to create a funding council for Wales. Even on the Government's
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
figures, there will be more people on the funding council than schools eligible for grant through the mechanism under which the funding council will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be sensible to have a 20 per cent. trigger before establishing the funding council for Wales, which we all agree will be costly and will create a new national bureaucracy. The 20 per cent. mechanism is very important because the financial memorandum says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is expected that the costs of the funding authorities will be offset over time by savings in the running costs of the Department for Education and the Welsh Office and the central administration costs of Local Education Authorities, as well as savings from the removal of surplus places at their instigation."</p></blockquote>
An extended time scale will be necessary if the budget is to be balanced by savings on central Government and local government costs as a result of the establishment of the funding agency. That time scale could be even longer for the funding council for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider some of the possibilities for self-financing the funding council by offsetting the costs of LEAs. I would be happy for the Minister to intervene at any point if he can provide financial information to fill in the gaps in our knowledge and to respond to speculation about the development of the proposals in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to quantify the costs that a LEA could save if only one or two schools opted out. If 20 per cent. opted out there could be specific savings in an authority's staff costs and in the paper used for circulars. But if only one or two schools opted out in the eight Welsh LEAs, it would be difficult for them to make significant savings in their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, far fewer than 1 per cent. of schools have opted out. I do not know how any LEA could be expected to make savings that would enable the funding council for Wales to be established, at no extra cost, even over a few years, given the pace of the move towards grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall debate the savings in terms of surplus places later, but perhaps the Minister will explain the savings that will result. The Government believe that the Bill will be part of a savings package, and therefore it is important that we monitor events so as to identify the serious fault line, which is similar to that which appears in a different Bill about Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only three schools have become grant-maintained in Wales in four years, as my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen said. That is fewer than one each year. Two were created because Gwent LEA, in its attempt to follow Welsh Office guidelines, tried to restructure its secondary education service to get rid of surplus places. Two schools that were chosen for closure, whose pupils were to be redistributed to other schools nearby, took part in the opt-out procedure and were saved from closure by the Welsh Office. Gwent therefore killed the problem of surplus places in that instance, so the Welsh Office made no saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal to set up a funding council for Welsh schools will be financed partly by a reduction in central Government and local authority costs and partly through the savings obtained from a reduction in school places. From what we know so far, however, any proposal to reduce school places will be opposed. The Gwent plan was significant in setting a pattern for the rest of Wales. All Welsh LEAs will proceed with considerable caution on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
any closure proposals because of fears that the Welsh Office itself will undermine the measures that they intend to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that elsewhere in the Bill—again a paradox—the Welsh Office and the Secretary of State for Education take unto themselves substantial powers to reduce the number of surplus places. I shall be intrigued to see how the circle will be squared in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the 20 per cent. trigger may be open to negotiation and flexibility. The Minister asked what would happen if schools in certain LEAs became grant-maintained, and the 20 per cent. threshold was not achieved. That may not necessarily be the disaster that the Minister of State believes it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what may happen. One difficulty is that the Government have yet to produce a common funding formula for grant-maintained schools, which would be helpful when considering the circumstances in which the trigger mechanism might work and whether the funding council is necessary. The funding council has two principal roles, although others may be developed and added to it in time. The first is to fund the grant-maintained schools and the second—once the trigger point of 10 per cent. of pupils in grant-maintained schools is reached—is to have a role in making policy for the provision of places and, later, for the placing of individual pupils. It is important to consider those two roles in relation to our proposal that 20 per cent. of pupils should be in grant-maintained schools before a funding council is set up in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the Government's commitment to a common funding formula, I cannot see any reason why a funding council is needed for a particular school. If there was a funding formula for grant-maintained schools, the mechanism for the establishment of those schools could operate. It should be well within the powers of the Welsh Office and the LEAs—the present eight or the future 20-plus unitary authorities—between them to ensure that schools receive the money to which they are entitled under the funding mechanism. It should be perfectly possible for the Welsh Office and the LEAs to deal with the anomalies, appeals or difficulties that may occur in a few cases. The funding formula almost negates the need for a funding council to tackle that aspect of the grant-maintained system. What administrative problems are envisaged after the creation of the common funding formula that will need to be overseen by a funding council?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once 10 per cent. of pupils in an LEA area are in grant-maintained schools the other principal activity of the funding council would be policy making. To judge by the current rate of moves towards grant-maintained status, even if some of the 50 or 60 schools that have made inquiries proceed to hold a ballot, most schools will not ballot "yes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents in Wales who have had an opportunity to express their views about the Government's education policy—the Bill is a principal part of it—reject it with a resounding no. The Government represent less than 15 per cent. of people in Wales, the Labour party more than 70 per cent. The Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament from Wales and the four Plaid Cymru Members oppose Government policy. More than 85 per cent. of the people who voted in the general election in Wales therefore rejected Government policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Housing Act 1988, everyone who did not bother to vote on whether estates should leave local authority control was regarded as having supported the
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
Government. In the grant-maintained sector in Wales, a minuscule minority of parents support the Government's policy, which was originally outlined in the Education Reform Act 1988, and is beefed up in the Bill. Parents in Wales have not been taken in by Government talk about grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must thank the hon. Gentleman. He has raised an important point about the time scale to which the Minister of State referred when he described the pressing need to set up the funding council in Wales. The Minister expected that the funding council will need to be established in Wales by the time the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, new governing bodies are being established all over Wales. Their membership is established and most will have had their initial business meetings. I should be surprised if quite a few of those governing bodies did not decide to study the Government's grant-maintained option. Yet I doubt that they will examine it in too much detail, as I suspect that they will agree with the headmaster of the Queen Elizabeth high school in Hexham, who described the grant-maintained system as an unsavoury method of ensuring that the schools that need the money least get it and that those who need it most do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an element of bribery, at least in the short term, in the move to grant-maintained status. That element is most noticeable in voluntary-aided schools, but it is present, in the second phase, for locally maintained schools. Gowerton comprehensive school in West Glamorgan recently voted overwhelmingly—by 2:11 in a ballot turnout of more than 70 per cent.—against grant-maintained status. A principal reason for that resounding thumbs-down was the parents' healthy cynicism about whether the initial bribes would be extended over a period of time. When the vote was held, parents had not seen the figures for projected education expenditure over the next three years, but they knew of the letter sent out by the Secretary of State for Education warning grant-maintained schools in England that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
need not apply for libraries, swimming pools and leisure facilities for their schools in the coming spending round as they would not be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, while the two-tier system exists, local education authorities are still discussing and negotiating with borough and district councils ways of ensuring that, for example, leisure facilities on the site of a comprehensive school will be open to the public during and after school hours, when appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents can see through the Government's bribe. They realise that funding at the proposed level will not continue beyond the first year or two. They realise, too, that if a funding council for Wales is established, it will be much more remote than a local education authority. The funding council's remit is to be involved in policy for providing school places in a local authority area when the 10 per cent. trigger has been reached. Will it be achieved in any existing local education authority area in Wales? Even if the speed of the move towards grant-maintained status were greatly increased, a decade might pass before the mechanism would be triggered for any existing local education authority to be involved in the provision of grant-maintained school places as a matter of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must therefore ask whether we need a school funding council. When there are grant-maintained schools in an LEA area, funded under the common-funding formula, there is no need for an extra layer of bureaucracy. The LEA could still be responsible for the provision of school places, whatever types of schools there might be. The Welsh Office could act as a fall-back. For example, although I cannot envisage it under current legislation, if a grant-maintained school felt that an LEA was unfair or biased in respect of policy for the provision of places, it could have the right of appeal to the Welsh Office. The need for a funding council could be spirited away and buried before it was created as the most helpful way of saving the Government money. The creation of a schools funding council for Wales could end up as a top-heavy administration with more board members and employees to carry out its work than there are in the schools in Wales which need care under the proposed body.

I want the Minister to give more details about the financing of the funding council. When would he consider it necessary for the Secretary of State for Wales to initiate the order to set up the funding council? If he cannot tell us when, I could imagine an LEA, or even parents, anxious about the waste of public money, seeking a judicial review because the Secretary of State was acting unreasonably in creating a funding council in Wales when only 10, 12 or even 20 schools qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 20 per cent. trigger proposed in the amendment is reasonable, but we would be willing to discuss it with the Secretary of State. We would even be prepared to discuss the number of primary and secondary schools that would have to be grant maintained before the order is laid by the Secretary of State for Wales for the creation of the funding council, if it is needed. The Minister did not say, even approximately, how many or what percentage of schools would need to be grant maintained. His only reference to the desirability of creating the schools funding council for Wales was that it may be necessary to do it once the Bill is enacted. How many schools does the Secretary of State believe will be grant maintained when the Bill has completed its progress through Parliament? With such information, we could better tell what the Government intend in trying to create a funding council in Wales, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
I believe to be wholly unnecessary, given the dynamic roles of the Welsh Office, the LEAs and the Welsh joint education committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for this drastic measure, only for some fine-tuning. The Government propose throwing out the engine and replacing it with something that is completely unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The schools funding council will have two duties: first, to take over from the Welsh Office the essentially executive function of paying grants to grant-maintained schools; secondly, to act alongside the LEAs to secure sufficient school places. The amendment proposes that that body should not be set up until 20 per cent. of the schools in Wales have achieved grant-maintained status. The hon. Member for Bridgend will know from later clauses and from my earlier speech that the point at which the second duty of the schools funding council is triggered is 10 per cent. of the pupils in any LEA area. That point could be reached, even on the hon. Gentleman's argument, in a very short time. In that event, the schools funding council must be in existence because of its duty to provide for sufficient school places. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State cannot be directly involved in the provision of school places because any proposal for closure would go to him for a quasi-judicial decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given what the Minister said, how many schools does he expect to be grant maintained by the time that the Bill is enacted? Which LEAs does he expect will shortly have 10 per cent. of pupils in the grant-maintained sector? We think that the 10 per cent. trigger mechanism is far too low and we shall table an amendment later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first question, I cannot give any forecast because the progress to grant-maintained status depends on the wishes of parents. We are urging Opposition Members to consider carefully that democratic aspect. Parental choice is what matters to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On his second question, I can give him an example from West Glamorgan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent a constituency in Mid-Glamorgan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the hon. Gentleman referred to Gowerton. In West Glamorgan there are 22,928 pupils in 27 secondary schools; 10 per cent. of which is 2,292 pupils. Bishop Vaughan grant-maintained school has 938 pupils. So the hon. gentleman can see that progress is being made. Two more secondary schools would trigger off the 10 per cent. mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to tackle the hon. Gentleman on one point. He made a great deal of the fact that two out of the three schools in the grant-maintained sector had been threatened with closure. There is no conflict between our policy on GM schools and that on surplus places. There is certainly no blanket approval of GM status for schools threatened with closure. As he knows, there was a proposal to close the Queen's school at Newport and at the same time, an application for grant-maintained status was submitted. That was also the case for Cefnpennar school. In both cases, the application for GM status was rejected but the proposal to close was approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has a statutory duty to consider applications for GM status on their merits, just as he has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
a duty to consider LEA proposals for rationalisation on their merits. If there is no application for grant-maintained status, only the LEA's proposals are considered. If there is a GM application, the Secretary of State is statutorily bound to consider it on its merits alongside the LEA's proposals, as in the case of Cwmcarn school. The Secretary of State's decision to give grant-maintained status to Cwmcarn was twice challenged in the courts and the decision was upheld.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us an assurance that if a local education authority attempts to rationalise its school places because of falling rolls and school closures are proposed, it will not be inhibited by the acceptance of applications for grant-maintained status from schools threatened with closure? Will he give that commitment now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am just coming to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That question is wide of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to respond to the hon. Member for Bridgend and in my remarks I shall cover an aspect of the question put by the hon. Member for Warrington, South. We are all concerned about surplus places in schools. In Wales the 118,000 surplus places cost £23 million. We would all prefer that money to be used elsewhere in the education system. That is why the Bill provides that the local education authorities and the grant-maintained schools funding council act together to deal with the problem of places. The requirement upon local education authorities to rationalise has been extended to the GM sector. The schools funding council will be bound by statute to be active in that sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the distribution of grant responsibility, given that we are to have a common funding formula, why will local education authorities not be allowed to administer that formula in their areas? Why is a national bureaucracy needed to do that job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is straying into the subject of another set of amendments that we shall come to later. However, the simple answer to his question is that he is forgetting that the essence of grant-maintained status for a school is that, after a ballot, a majority of parents will have chosen to be outside local education authority control. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that those parents' wishes should be flouted and that the schools and the distribution of funds to them should be returned to the local education authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I am afraid that that is precisely what the hon. Gentleman's argument appears to be. The Bill's provision that the local education authorities and the schools funding council collaborate over the problem of school places is by far the most equitable and sensible proposal. However, I am sure that that will be discussed later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be aware that the Minister of State is the Government's longest-serving Minister. Given his responsibility for education in the Principality, the Minister will have spent many years going round the counties of Wales. He will know that, on balance, the institutions that deal with education in Wales—from the Welsh joint education committee to the local
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
education authorities—have done a first-class job in providing education for our children. He knows also, deep in his heart, that there is no upsurge of interest in grant-maintained schools in Wales. There are no such schools in the Minister's constituency, nor indeed in the whole of north Wales. Before we embark on the costly and unwanted experiment of setting up the schools funding council, we should let matters settle down, as proposed in the amendment. There is not a scrap of evidence that the majority of Welsh parents want grant-maintained schools. For that reason, I intend to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 1, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) The Schools Funding Council for Wales will in making decisions related to the provision of places have a mind to the necessity of encouraging and making sufficient provision for bilingual education at all levels that fall within its competence.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with bilingualism and the functions of the funding council for Wales. It is impossible to separate the Welsh language from education in Wales or to discuss the development of education in Wales without understanding the role of the Welsh language in such development. It is also impossible to understand the position occupied by the Welsh language in Wales—or in England—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is unfair to hon. Members when there is so much background noise that they cannot be heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is impossible to understand the position occupied by the Welsh language in Wales—or in England—without considering the influence of the education system upon it. Amendment No. 61 tackles the second aspect that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision of the outstanding pioneer, Griffiths Jones, to make Welsh the teaching medium in his circulating schools was very influential. Those schools made Welsh people perhaps the most literate people in Europe at the beginning of the 19th century. Griffiths Jones' decision was strategic, and continued the tradition of the Sunday schools of Thomas Charles. That tradition established Welsh as a language of high prestige almost throughout Wales in the domain of education and religion, just as it was denigrated in the domain of law, civil administration and commerce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
The break with that tradition in the voluntary provision of education occurred with the establishment of the state system by the Education Act 1870. That had a devastating effect on the Welsh language at a time of rapid social and demographic change, setting in motion what sociologists of language would call language shift. That process has changed the Welsh language from being the language of the vast majority of the Welsh people in the middle of the last century to being a language of the minority, although not an insignificant majority in any sense of the word. The fact that the Welsh language gained first a toehold—at elementary and primary level—and then a foothold—at long last, at secondary level—in schools made possible the survival of Welsh as a vigorous language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of Welsh as a subject and then as a teaching medium—as a factor to be taken seriously in Welsh education—was a long and gradual process. It involved enormous dedication and commitment by many people, some famous, the great majority unsung. The process took the whole of the 20th century to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my lifetime, the movement has gained considerable momentum. Others will say likewise. Increasing numbers of people from English, non-Welsh speaking homes, and ever greater numbers from Welsh-speaking homes, receive part of their education in the Welsh language. The numbers are roughly equivalent. In Wales, there is a broad consensus, and growing enthusiasm, for promoting the movement and the Welsh language. This has been paralleled by the general expansion of the use of Welsh in domains from which previously it was excluded such as commerce, administration and the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent censuses show signs that the language shift against Welsh is slowing, even that it may have turned the corner. It would be idle and extremely naive to think that the future of the Welsh language is secure, but there are "green shoots", which may be less illusory than others of which we have heard in the past year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put that into context by suggesting that what is afoot in Wales is a significant enterprise. It is no less than an attempt at what Joshua Fishman, the expert on bilingualism and the sociology of language would call the reversal of language shifts. Fishburn speaks of RLS—the reversal of language shift—and of people such as me as RLSers. It involves revitalisation, revival and expansion in both the knowledge and use of the Welsh language. It goes without saying that it is a process in which education and schools must play a leading role. It cannot be otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development of the Welsh language requires also the adoption of a strategy, and planning. I hope that the use of the dreaded word "planning" will not make me enemies. Perhaps that is less likely on the Government Benches than it would have been a few months ago. Hitherto, strategic planning was the responsibility of local government, through LEAs. It was undertaken with the support of national bodies—"national" in the sense in which we in Wales use it, referring to Welsh bodies which are supported by national bodies such as the Welsh joint education committee. This is itself a body that is made up of representatives of local government and, in that sense, it is a secondary, democratic body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
Welsh LEAs have developed and published policies for Welsh language development in education. These policies were implemented with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Comparison of their implementation by two adjoining counties illustrates this well. Mid Glamorgan education authority has been progressive and vigorous in its pursuit of the development of education in the Welsh language. Next door, in another Labour-controlled authority—west Glamorgan—not one Welsh language primary school has been established since the reorganisation of local government in 1972, despite growing demand and enormous pressure from parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has of necessity been variation in the type and pattern of policy according to the linguistic circumstances of different parts of the Principality. Gwynedd, Dyfed and Gwent have pursued three different approaches. I shall not go into detail about the differences, I say only that this variation is encompassed in the term "bilingualism."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee his remedy for what he described as the problem of LEAs not moving ahead in providing Welsh-medium schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not propose abolishing the democratic process in local government because an enhancement of that process is required. I would give the Bill my enthusiastic support if it contained more democratic proposals to make local government more sensitive and democratically accountable. I cannot accept that the abolition of local government is the answer to failure by local government to respond to public demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would also be a requirement that people use the ballot box and, by means of the democratic process, insist on progressive change. The Minister will agree that local government should be made more sensitive, and answerable to the people, by the use of the democratic process, not by its removal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, with its duty to provide school places, the schools funding council for Wales might be able to act where an LEA has failed to met the wishes of many parents, as in the circumstances that he described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I shall come to that. As I said, there is no doubt that, occasionally, a non-democratic body might act with greater enlightenment than a democratic body. However, the creation of undemocratic bodies is a long-term recipe for a refusal to respond to public need. We must therefore study the long-term considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "bilingualism" encompasses the various provisions in the different LEAs in Wales. For example, biliungual education can mean that all pupils study for all or most subjects in Welsh: that is called a bilingual school. Bilingual education can also mean that some pupils receive all or most of their education in Welsh and other pupils in the same school receive their education in English. There are various interesting differences in models at primary level as, for example, between Gwynedd and Dyfed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The merits of the models in Wales are the subject of much debate—I would even go so far as to say that there is much passionate disagreement about them. My amendment does not seek to judge as between the merits of the various models, but it asserts the promotion of bilingual education and hence the promotion of bilingualism. The amendment would promote the strategic availability of sufficient provision for bilingual education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
The policies of the LEAs make bilingual education a matter of strategic consideration, but the Bill would remove power from the LEAs—partially at first, and then totally. I wish that that were not so, and I hope that there will be resistance to the process of increasing the number of grant-maintained schools, but I fear that there may not be. If the schools funding council for Wales becomes responsible for greater numbers of schools in Wales, it is essential that the council fulfil the LEAs' function of representing the Welsh language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of promoting bilingualism—of creating a bilingual society—is implicit in the Education Reform Act 1988, which made Welsh a foundation subject in nearly all schools in Wales and a core subject in certain schools. The aim is to make all Welsh people bilingual. We look forward to the introduction of a Welsh Language Act; we hope that it will be an Act of substance—rather more substantial than the proposals of the Welsh Language Board, which is a quango appointed by the Secretary of State for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue of bilingual education should be covered in the Bill, which is intended to transform the structure of educational provision. Bilingual education should be an explicit part of the remit of the body that will be at the heart of the new structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are at a crucial juncture in the history of the Welsh language. The threat to its survival remains. In some respects, that threat is greater than ever: a massive demographic change is challenging the formerly strong position of Welsh in its heartlands. But this is also a time of great opportunity and growth. On behalf of the great majority of the people of Wales who wish the Welsh language to flourish, I am asking the Committee to provide the language with the impetus for that. I hope that all hon. Members will support this non-controversial amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to support the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis). I remind the Committee that the Minister of State has responsibility for the Welsh language and for education. It is fortuitous that he will be able to answer our points. I assume that the Minister will be leading for the Government on the Welsh language Bill when it comes before the House. For the sake of his health, I hope that it is not introduced too soon, otherwise he will have difficulty manning both Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Education Bill has over 200 clauses and it refers to the establishment of a national curriculum assessment authority for Wales. We shall deal with a number of matters concerning the Welsh language and with the Welsh language education development committee of the Welsh joint education committee, which we all regret will go. But we shall discuss that another time; I simply set the scene for the points that I wish to make in support of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local education authorities in Wales that have a rural population have expressed considerable concern about the effect of the Bill on Welsh language education. They are concerned that it does not suit rural areas and that if a Welsh medium school, because of the transitory nature of its parent population, decides to change its status to grant-maintained, a large minority of parents who wish their children to be educated through the medium of Welsh will have no option but to send their children to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
grant-maintained school, even though they do not agree with those schools. That is an especially difficult problem in parts of rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North referred to the diversity of approach to the teaching of Welsh in Welsh LEAs. He is right to be concerned. In his constituency, the majority of people speak Welsh; mine is probably the least Welsh-speaking constituency in the Principality, yet in both there is a thriving movement for Welsh language—education geared, naturally, to the individual problems and diversity of those counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear is that the dimunition of the role of LEAs—especially when there are 24 instead of eight—will make the provision of proper, Welsh-medium education more and more difficult because it will be set alongside the so-called movement for opt-out schools. It will not work out as well as the Minister thinks it might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dyfed county council, in its submissions to the Secretary of State this summer, expressed considerable disquiet about the effect of opt-out schools on rural areas and on the teaching of Welsh. The Government should think carefully about the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the opportunity to dispel any fears about the future of Welsh medium education. Concerns have been expressed about the spread of grant-maintained schools. People are worried that the establishment of the schools funding council for Wales will prejudice the provision of Welsh medium education. Those fears are not founded on fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North referred to the strategy that has evolved in the development of Welsh-medium schools over the years. He rightly paid tribute to the LEAs and the Welsh joint education committee. At our first sitting, the hon. Gentleman was also generous in his praise of the Welsh Office and of the part that I played in this matter. Perhaps his generosity to the Welsh Office has abandoned him today, or perhaps he thought that there was a danger that he might overdo it. However, I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is aware of the role that the Welsh Office has played and of the importance of introducing Welsh as a foundation subject in the national curriculum. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government intend to maintain our good record in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted to hear the hon. Gentleman refer to Griffith Jones, one of our leading educationists in the 18th century. I am sure that he will have noticed that a quotation, in English, from Griffith Jones's "Welsh Piety" of 1751 appears at the top of the chapter devoted to Wales in the White Paper. The passage reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for it is certain that very many children, little more than babes taken as it were from the breast to the book, are capable of making much greater advancement in learning than is commonly imagined, if they are properly dealt with … It will give their parents cause to adore their Maker to see the talents He gave their little ones dilate themselves so early and so surprisingly."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Committee will agree with that statement, but I doubt, Mr. Martin, that you would allow me to cover the ground between 1751 and the Education Act 1944. However, the statutory obligation on local education authorities to provide suitable education, including Welsh-medium education as appropriate, is already well established in the 1944 Act, where the section 8 duty to secure sufficient schools of the right character and so forth covers the ability to set up Welsh-medium schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
Where the schools funding council for Wales shares with LEAs the responsibility to secure sufficient school places—or, indeed, where it assumes the sole responsibility for that task—under clause 7, to which we shall come later, it will include provision for Welsh-medium education. The schools funding council for Wales will be obliged to deal with the provision of Welsh-medium education in the grant-maintained sector. It was this point with which I wanted to deal when I intervened for the second time on the speech of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North. I have visited all three grant-maintained schools in Wales and have seen Welsh cherished as a subject and taught in some, if not all, of those schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the Bill threatens Welsh-medium education. As the hon. Member for Torfaen implied, the proposals to establish the curriculum and assessment authority for Wales—which will be discussed later in our deliberations—and the transfer to it of responsibilities for the development of Welsh language classroom material will strengthen the provision of Welsh-medium education. That is a debate for another day, but I am sufficiently convinced to assure the Committee that what we propose will benefit Welsh-medium education greatly and will improve on current arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the bill hampers the provision of Welsh-medium education. The powers to provide such education derive from the Education Act 1944 and are covered in clause 7 of the Bill. I hope that the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North will withdraw his amendment in the light of those assurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly disappointed by what the Minister said. The hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North presented a cogent argument for including a specific reference to a bilingual education in the list of responsibilities of the schools funding council for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the history of the vicissitudes of the Welsh language, but it is salutary to compare the fate of the Welsh language with that that has befallen other Celtic languages, such as Cornish, Erse and Gaelic in Scotland, which have almost disappeared. Desperate rearguard actions are fought to keep them alive. In Wales, thanks to people such as Griffiths Jones, and to the non-conformist revivals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Welsh was the language of culture and religion. Today, despite the overpowering influence of English, more than 20 per cent. of people in Wales speak Welsh. The language is doing well in schools. Tribute has already been paid to my county, Mid Glamorgan. The former Glamorgan county council was a pioneer in the provision of bilingual education, especially in the English-speaking parts of Wales. The late Lord Heycock should be mentioned, because he did much to promote bilingualism in a very English-speaking part of Wales where, 50 years earlier, the majority of people spoke Welsh. While I appreciate the provision for bilingual education that exists in the 1944 Act, the Bill should recognise that the schools funding council will have a special responsibility for such education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would respect any technical advice that the Minister received from his civil servants about the legal ineligibility of the amendment, or about any dubiety that it would
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
place on the working of the schools funding council for Wales. But if those handicaps do not exist, the Minister should accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate what I said: the amendment is unnecessary. Its aim is covered by the 1944 Act.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speak at length, but I shall press the amendment to a Division. The Minister has said nothing that persuades me to change my belief that there is no reason for rejecting the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the 1988 Act had made Welsh a foundation or core subject. The key issue, however, is the standing of Welsh as a teaching medium; bilingual education means the use of Welsh alongside English, to varying degrees, as the medium of education. I am fearful that that will depend upon the good will of Ministers in the Welsh Office and that does not provide the certainty that we want. I do not suggest that the Bill deliberately intends to undermine the position of the Welsh language, but I am fearful that confusion about its strategic function will unquestionably arise as the funding council and local government share responsibility for the provision of places. When and if the schools funding council takes complete responsibility for that, uncertainty about that strategic function will lead to a failure systematically to further the process of developing Welsh as a medium of education and to provide schools of various types for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that, as the Minister said, the powers of local government under the 1944 Act will be transferred to the funding council. That may be so, but that is no argument for there being no statement on the issue at this crucial juncture in the development of legislation. There is no reason why a further statement should not be made—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than being repetitive, in effect the amendment would supersede what is in the 1944 Act, making it stronger and more explicit.

	<p>I should like also to announce that I have, exceptionally, accepted a manuscript amendment to amendment No. 52, as the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North had corrected it but his correction failed to appear on the amendment paper. The amendment should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(5) The county council representatives shall be chosen by meetings of these councils not more than two weeks following county council elections, and the co-option of at least four of the additional members will occur at the first meeting of the reconstituted Schools Funding Council for Wales.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments relates to the composition of the schools funding council for Wales. They are designed to make that council more representative of the various people and groups that the schools are intended to serve. I hope that the term "service" is not redundant in relation to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 39, 42 and 52 would make the schools council more democratically accountable by including among its members representatives of local government and county councils. Amendment No. 39 does not, however, suggest my approval of the establishment of the funding council, and I shall vote against the inclusion of clause 2 in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that local authorities are by far the best organisations to have responsibility for education in schools. They are democratically accountable and close to the communities that they serve. They have intimate knowledge of the social, geographical, cultural and linguistic considerations of communities as well as the variation between them. To tackle the problem of local variation, the funding council will have to spawn regional, and even local, bureaucracies. A bureaucratic structure will be established that is not vastly dissimilar to the present one, but without the component of democratic accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that I accept that LEAs are not perfect. It is worth reminding ourselves that imperfection is part of the human condition: this is as likely to be expressed through the democratic process as through any other. Occasionally, we find intransigence and slow progress in democratic local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the failure of West Glamorgan, since 1972, to establish a single Welsh medium primary school. However, such deficiencies should be tackled through the enhancement and further refinement of the democratic process, not through its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>161</span>
elimination. There is no reason why people's rights to Welsh medium education should not be established by statute, that is one way to ensure that local authorities may not frustrate people's aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 recognises that different circumstances apply in Wales because we are a nation. I prefer the appellation, "nation" to that sentimental and rather meaningless appellation, "Principality". I have little warmth towards the latter description. In Wales, we have a radically different cultural and social tradition. I suppose that that is reflected in the fact that we shall have a "council" in Wales, rather than an "agency". We are not particularly enthusiastic about that point either, because, in reality, the council and the agency will have exactly the same power. It is interesting that the clause relating to Wales states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order make provision for the establishment of a body corporate".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that shows that the Government and the Welsh Office are uncertain about the extent to which grant-maintained status in Wales will become the norm. Does it show less enthusiasm from the Welsh Office than from the Department for Education concerning grant-maintained status?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume the worst—we have to assume the worst in relation to the clause. I fear the combination of the Bill and the reorganisation of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of whether the Welsh Office favoured the schools funding council, perhaps the Minister of State was, earlier, being a little coy
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
about having a specific trigger mechanism because he may have thought that our own trigger mechanism of 20 per cent. would make the process rather long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am uncertain about the intentions of the Welsh Office, but I have an underlying suspicion that we shall have a takeover by the funding council of the strategic function from local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must register the fact that parental wishes matter in that instance. The Welsh Office and the Department for Education are totally dependent on parental wishes about grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a saying in Welsh, "Mae mwy nag un ffordd o gael Wil i'w wely". That translates as, "There is more than one way of getting Wil into his bed." In English, the equivalent expression is rather coarser—something about there being more than one ways to skin a cat. The combination of the Bill and the reorganisation of local government is calculated to encourage and drive forward the process of opting out and the establishment of grant-maintained status schools in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must assume the worst—that the strategic function will exist at the all-Wales level. If that is to be so, I should like that strategic function to be conducted by an education department in a Welsh Government, which is answerable to a democratic Welsh Parliament. If it is to be at the all-Wales level, that is how it should be controlled. Would that such a body existed. I look forward to its establishment and to its decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
