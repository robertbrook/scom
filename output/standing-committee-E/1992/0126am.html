</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a result of the new business arrangement to which we have agreed, we are beginning an important two-day debate on special educational needs. I wish to put on record my deep concern—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am finding it hard to hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to place on record at the start of the debate my concern that the guillotine and the flood of Government amendments on today's amendment paper will mean that there will be insufficient time to debate many special educational needs provision issues, with little opportunity to discuss many people's concerns about various proposals in the Bill, let alone those proposals covered by the Government's new amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of time will be of great concern to many people who work in the sector, particularly to parents of children with special educational needs, about whom Conservative Members have shown scant regard. The Bill has been hastily cobbled together and now the amendments are introduced, in profusion, tabled with no time for discussion by the relevant bodies and with little rationed time for debate in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we are studying the definition of special educational provision. Hon. Members will be aware that the definition has not changed from the wording used in the Education Act 1981, other than reference to grant-maintained schools. It is important that we use the amendments to test the adequacy of the definition. Similarly, in later clauses, it will be important to test whether the Bill and the amendments will ensure that the envisaged provision will be adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should study the words of the Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Crosby (Sir M. Thornton). He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before this Bill proceeds much further we need a sensible, round-the-table discussion between all those who are involved at every level to see how essential services for these children can be provided. Only then can there be a proper framework.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If we really believe that somehow special educational needs are going to be given a better deal under the new legislation than under the old system, then this is the biggest triumph of hope over experience that I have ever encountered."</p></blockquote>
It is important that we probe all aspects of the Government's proposals in the Bill and the amendments. In this debate, I wish to probe only the Bill's definition of special educational needs. The amendments explore the reasons for differences between the White Paper and the Bill. We wish especially to examine why one group of children—the exceptionally able—has been omitted from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not poke fun at the amendment. I can anticipate such a speech: "The hon. Member for Bath proposes that we include in the definition of special educational needs children who are exceptionally able. No doubt he will table further
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0688">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1053</span>
amendments to include other children and in due course, he will require every child to have a statement." I hope that the Minister will not claim that I am trying to make mischief and delay the Bill. I am genuinely trying to give him an opportunity to explain his understanding of the definitions in the clause, and the reasons for changes in Government thinking between the publication of the White Paper and that of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory and financial memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill amends the law relating to education so as to give effect to the proposals set out in the White Paper 'Choice and Diversity: A New Framework for Schools' published on 28 July 1992."</p></blockquote>
The Bill is intended, therefore, to effect the proposals of the White Paper. Why have changes been made to the provisions for children with exceptional ability? Paragraph 1.51 of the White Paper contains a phrase that I have included in the amendment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many children have particular educational needs. Some because they have learning difficulties, others because their behaviour is disruptive, others because they are exceptionally able and cannot be stretched sufficiently to give expression to their abilities. The Government is equally concerned about all of these children."</p></blockquote>
Yet the language begins to change in the next paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our approach to these children's education is based upon the same fundamental principles which run through all our policies—an emphasis on the needs of the individual child; the right of parents to know about their education and to be involved; the duty on LEAs to identify, assess and provide for special needs; and the duty to ensure that a child with special needs of whatever sort should be educated in a mainstream school".</p></blockquote>
The paragraph refers to special needs "of whatever sort", which in paragraph 1.51 covers not only learning disabilities—the term used in the Bill—but the two other categories of disruptive behaviour and children with exceptional ability who cannot be stretched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tabled the amendments so that the definitions in the clause can be clarified, and the Minister can explain why, when the Bill states that it is putting the White Paper into practice, there are a number of omissions, one of which I have drawn to the Committee's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter, but the hon. Gentleman is barking up the wrong tree. His reading of the White Paper is ingenious, but he has misconstrued its intention. He referred to the section headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Meeting the Needs and Aspirations of All Pupils",</p></blockquote>
which is divided into sections dealing with children with learning difficulties, children who behave badly and the brighter child. Those children are significantly different and it is inevitable that they will occasionally have to be treated differently by the education system. That is the background to the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wants to alter the words of the Bill to challenge what has become widely accepted since 1981 as the general definition of the provision for children with special educational needs. This issue is basic to this part of the Bill and I hope that we shall reach an agreement and understanding about it at this stage. The amendment gives us an opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that until now the working definition of, and the approach to, special educational needs has involved children with learning difficulties, handicaps and problems variously defined and identified. We shall discuss later the allocation of responsibilities between mainstream
	<span class='label label-info column'>1054</span>
and special schools, LEAs and grant-maintained schools and the role of the funding agency for schools. Those important matters will be considered, but in a general context. Until now we have focused our minds on children with difficulties and special needs of the kind that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is entitled to import to this consideration the brighter, gifted or exceptionally able child and to argue that we should broaden the scope of the definitions, which are widely accepted and so firmly embedded in policy and in legislation, so as to embrace an altogether different group of children with very different needs. We could attempt to do that, but it would be misguided and rather dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman has told me off in his best schoolmasterly way, I will not make heavy weather of the semantics of the issue, but they are important because the words "particular need" could be widely construed. We have examined carefully what those words could encompass. They could include children with needs arising from their use of English as a second language. That is certainly an important area but not one to be dealt with under the rubric of part III and the definition of special educational needs as we have used it and worked with it until now. If pressed, I could come up with other, more exotic examples of how the term "particular need" could be broadened so much that it could soon endager the usefulness of the definition of special educational needs and undermine our efforts to concentrate on that provision. I shall not dwell on the semantic consideration any longer, but it is important that the Committee is aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About gifted children I shall say only that our policies centre on the role of the national curriculum. That is the framework in which we hope to identify the needs of particularly able or gifted children and to stretch and explore their abilities to the maximum within the 10-point scale of achievement, whose upper range is intended to deal with particularly able pupils. That is not to say that such pupils willl not benefit from the special arrangements already provided by many schools. However, to import the amendment's provisions into the Bill and to redefine the meaning and thrust of special educational needs to encompass the important group identified by the amendment would be a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greg Pope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hyndburn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that the Minister has accepted that, in certain circumstances, schools will make ad hoc provision for special needs provision for gifted children. Why does he not accept that such children and their parents should be allowed the protection of a statement, which is a form of contract between the local education authority, the parents and the child to ensure a minimum level of provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to outline the reason already: the statementing procedure is designed to give meaning to, and to underpin, the provisions that have existed since 1981; and that we are repeating, largely, in this Bill. The hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) is trying to take a definitional approach to the mechanistic solution proposed by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster). However, it is neither appropriate nor proper to use part III in that way. My mind is open to different approaches to the problem, but the approach adopted in the amendment is wrong. It runs counter to what all hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0689">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1055</span>
Members want—the provision of the most effective delivery of special educational needs policies. Those policies remain broadly similar to those that we have understood since 1981 but are developed in the Bill. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this group of amendments finds a resonance with members of the Committee. The Minister has said that the amendments challenge the definition of "special educational needs" that has existed since 1981, but that is why they have been tabled. We recognise that gifted or particularly able children should be included in that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 660 deals with the child who
	<br><blockquote><p>"has displayed a consistent capacity to learn exceptionally quickly."</p></blockquote>
The Education Act 1944 affords
	<br><blockquote><p>"For all pupils opportunities for education offering such variety of instruction and training as may be desirable in view of their different ages, abilities, and aptitudes."</p></blockquote>
Article 29 of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the education of the child shall be directed to the development of the child's personality, talents, mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential."</p></blockquote>
Those definitions of children's needs stretch far beyond those special needs for which the 1981 Act provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changes in the education system and the prevailing general social attitudes have sometimes diverted our attention from the needs of individual children. We shall fail in our duty and will deprive society at large if we do not provide the fullest opportunities for personal fulfilment for all children. Children of exceptional ability can be just as much a challenge, at home and at school, as those with learning difficulties. They have just as much right to have their needs defined and provided for as children with difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children who have special talents in sport and music are often well catered for in the education system. Their talents are obvious and mechanisms in the system ensure that such talent is used to full effect. Children who are talented at sport find themselves in teams for competitive sports, or participating in individual events where they can show their prowess, which is recognised by their peers and others. Children with special abilities in music can play instruments and join groups and orchestras. Those facilities are easily available and are well documented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The children who concern me most are those in the category of the intellectually gifted whose gifts lie in mathematics, science or technology—the more esoteric areas of learning. Such children may be pushed into taking up swimming, tennis or music so that those talents are used, although their true talent may lie elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Society has found pejorative terms for intellectually gifted children. We speak of boffins; a word often used as a source of fun when describing especially clever people. I found the word egghead in a thesaurus. The word "swot" is a comic book term. All those words are pejoratives for intellectually gifted children with special abilities. I challenge members of the Committee to find a pejorative for children who are gifted in music or sport—society does not use such words for children with those gifts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children who are not given challenging work may become disinterested in the classroom curriculum and consequently their attainment may drop to the average of their peers or even below it. Teachers will then not regard
	<span class='label label-info column'>1056</span>
such pupils as especially able and will not give them more advanced work. A vicious circle or downward spiral develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children with particular gifts may feel ostracised by their peers. Occasionally they become disruptive or badly behaved. Tragically, many children—especially girls, according to research—will conceal their talents to avoid being ostracised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago, a colleague who was an adviser in a local authority was called to see a seven-year-old girl with behavioural problems who had just begun her first year in junior school. The climax came during a maths lesson. The girl was drawing clocks and putting times on them. She suddenly tore up the paper and jumped on the desk. She was referred to an educational psychologist who sent her to my colleague. The girl was found to have ability in mathematics equivalent to a first-year mathematics undergraduate. That had not been recognised in the school. It took an educational psychologist, doing the equivalent of statementing on the girl, to establish her talent and special need. When that had been done, a programme of work to challenge her talent was formulated, with the help of a local secondary school and the local polytechnic. Had the girl's talent not been recognised, and action taken, I wonder what would have happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such stories worry me. How many children whose ability is not recognised sit quietly in school and do not tear up paper and jump on their desk? That child made an outward demonstration of her feelings. I wonder how many do that. Children should not need to behave in that way. Their ability should be recognised by appropriate systems. I reject the suggestion that the assisted places scheme is an adequate device for that purpose. So many children have differing talents and abilities that if we attempted to find schools for them we would need as many schools as there were children. Such ability should be catered for within mainstream education and in comprehensive and the new grant-maintained schools. I do not suggest that those children should be statemented. The Bill must recognise what those children need. We tabled the amendment for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee who are members of the Select Committee know that recent evidence to it challenged the need for statementing as the best method for all children. That was suggested by Mary Warnock in her evidence to the Committee and it is contained in its report, to be published later this year. We shall discuss it later. I would not take that route, but legal recognition of special ability is needed and the needs of those children must be identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be more appropriate to consider a number of devices, such as courses on the characteristics and educational needs of gifted children. They should be increased and included in syllabuses for all types of teacher training. All secondary schools should be screened to assist in detecting those with exceptional ability. Links could be established with colleges of further education and polytechnics to provide an enriched curriculum. All those avenues should be explored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Extension college should be approached to see to what extent its courses could be used for similar purposes. The practice of accelerating gifted pupils into older age groups should become more general, and schools
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0690">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1057</span>
should be encouraged to help gifted children to take more GCSE examinations, or to sit them when they are younger than the normal age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could also consider work experience schemes to provide gifted children with the opportunity to experience demanding occupations that require rigorous intellectual and creative thought. The amendments would have an important effect on the Bill. I am sure that much of what I have said will find some resonance with members of the Committee, and I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erewash)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the points made by the hon.

The proposal to include gifted children in the definition of special educational needs is not satisfactory. The provision associated with that definition is specific, as is the provision associated with the term "gifted". No child's needs will be served if we confuse or muddle those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many parents have encountered problems with finding out who has responsibility for providing for that need as well as with gaining recognition of it. I was involved in a case in which tests proved that a certain child was academically gifted. However, the LEA refused to do anything about it. Checking by me, the child's parents and an independent association revealed that only five education authorities in the country were prepared to recognise that academically gifted children had special requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who has the responsibility for devising suitable work programmes for gifted children? If they are not challenged at school they may become disruptive. That will not benefit them. In the cases with which I dealt, the educational authority told the parents that the responsibility lay with the school and its governing body, which responded that" it had received no guidance from the education authority. The amendments are not satisfactory, but responsibility for gifted children and their educational needs must be defined. Some such children may need to work in classes that are older than their age group, and schools should be required to define in their prospectuses how they intend to deal with such children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has repeated and agreed with much of what I said, and I agree with much of what she has said. However, if gifted children were included in the definition of special educational needs, as the amendment proposes, the problem that she has just articulated—that local education authorities and schools do not recognise the problem—could be overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two problems. The first is definition. We must be careful about that. To me and to parents who have been to see me, special educational needs means only one thing. It does not encompass the gifted child. If we redefine groups of people and include or remove categories, we confuse and muddle the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1058</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make my second point? The second problem is responsibility. The system fails because the LEA passes the buck to schools, and governing bodies are not clear about their responsibilities for gifted children. The refusal of many education authorities to acknowledge the existence of gifted children should be lamented. The problem should be recognised but not incorporated into a part of the Bill to which it is not relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should remind the Committee that we are considering the definition of "special educational needs". Clear definition is important because it aids identification. I welcome the inclusion of special educational needs in a general Bill on education. That was lacking in previous legislation. Although the Opposition do not like the Bill, it shows that special education is part of general education. Mainstream comprehensive schools are meant to provide for diversity in aptitude and attainment. That is why the Opposition found it difficult last week to accept the Government's enthusiasm for specialisation and selective schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special education is provided to prevent students from having difficulties at school and to safeguard the education of young people who experience difficulties. Special education policy and funding should have two aims: support and prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent changes in legislation and funding have strengthened the notion that two distinct groups of learners exist in our schools: those with and those without special needs. We should aim to integrate all children into mainstream schools. Specific definitions have existed for more than 10 years, and they have proved difficult to handle. Many people, including politicians and teachers, fail to understand the way in which three groups of students are defined. I shall consider those groups in order of decreasing size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The largest group consists of children with learning difficulties. Secondly, there are children with special educational needs, or children with learning difficulties that require special educational provision. Thirdly, there are children with special educational needs and they call for the authority to determine special educational provision for any learning difficulty that they may have. This group are the subject of statementing. The Bill requires the requirements of special needs children, with and without statements, to be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission report "Getting the Act Together" discussed Clwyd, which has developed a register of pupils with special needs and is now piloting guidelines for entering pupils on it. This highlights good practice, one to which the Audit Commission felt it important to draw attention. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The register, originally designed to encourage primary school teachers systematically to identify pupils with special needs, forms part of the LEA's scheme for the local management of schools (LMS). The register has two levels which relate to the severity of need in the child. Entry onto the first level of the register is a mark of a school's concern for a child experiencing difficulty in learning. A child can only be registered following discussion between the school and an LEA representative—usually the educational psychologist. Schools provide the extra help for pupils on level one of the register.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Level two of the register is for pupils with more severe special needs. The LEA is currently piloting guidelines for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1059</span>
teachers which indicate the level of need in a child which triggers inclusion at level two. These guidelines are the outcome of co-operation between the LEA and head teachers. They do not outline rigid categories of special need, but give schools a measure with which to assess whether a child's difficulties are severe enough to trigger the provision of extra help from the LEA."</p></blockquote>
The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Entry to level two of the register attracts additional funding for the school. The LEA has to agree that entry to this level is merited, and, as with entry to level one, this is done by educational psychologists who independenty assess whether a child's level of need is broadly consistent with the pilot guidelines."</p></blockquote>
That is a far more satisfactory way of going about things than that suggested in the paper that we received from the Secretary of State on 18 December on the common funding formula for grant-maintained schools, which discussed using a "proxy measure" for additional educational needs, perhaps
	<br><blockquote><p>"based on the number of pupils at a school eligible for free school meals."</p></blockquote>
The paper continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Using free school meal (FSM) numbers as the measure of CFF entitlement for additional educational needs seems to be the best option currently available."</p></blockquote>
If we can ensure that our definitions are correct, we should not need to use such proxy measures. We need to direct funding to and identify it more closely with children's needs. That could be achieved by adopting an approach similar to that of Clwyd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How sensible is it to define children who are subject of statements as having learning difficulties which call for special educational provision to be made for them and for whom it is necessary for the authority to determine the special educational provision which any learning difficulty they may have calls for? That is a complex mouthful. According to the Bill, a child who is in a wheelchair and is coping well with A-level physics has a learning difficulty if the school that he wishes to attend does not have ramps or a lift. That is absurd. Under the law as it is framed, a child who cannot cope with the language of instruction because his home language is not English has no learning difficulty, but our disabled physicist does. According to the Education Act 1981, my constituent Stephen Hawking has a learning difficulty. That is a good example which shows how absurd the definitions are. We need to separate learning difficulties from the provision of access to schools or of equipment to enable a physically disabled student to have access to the curriculum. The failure to provide lifts or accessible doorways and toilets prevents disabled teachers and support staff, as well as disabled parents, grandparents or other members of the community, from entering schools. Are all such people to be thought of as having learning difficulties?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying, in a small way, to correct that situation through the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is draping the clause in mystery. Learning difficulty is clearly defined as difficulty with learning. That does not necessarily mean mental or intellectual difficulty. It could equally mean physical difficulty over access to or use of the equipment in the school. The definition is surely constructed to cover the points that the hon. Lady has made, but not those introduced by amendment No. 772, which relates to exceptionally gifted children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1060</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is not just about exceptionally gifted children. If the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) reads it, he will see that it raises other issues. I have avoided the notion of gifted children. I am saying that it is absurd to define children with special needs as having learning difficulties. Under the Bill, one of the country's most able men, Stephen Hawking, would be defined as having a learning difficulty. The terminology is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate is valuable and I hope that it will stimulate thought among the Government and their advisers about the importance of a correct definition of special needs, particularly in the context of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up the last issue raised by the hon. Lady. I think that, were Stephen Hawking at school today, his current difficulty would present him with a learning difficulty. He would need the statementing process to ensure that the school that he was attending had the equipment, facilities and teaching specialisation to enable him to learn. I understand what the hon. Lady was saying about the juxtaposition of the words, but he would have had that difficulty and that is why the statementing process is needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman's mind and mine will meet on this issue, but I am sure that he would agree that, were Stephen Hawking in a place of learning with wide doorways, toilets for the disabled and the other facilities that he needed to go freely about the building, he would not have a learning difficulty. The onus should be on the buildings, not the person. To define someone as having a learning difficulty simply because he is in inappropriate surroundings is not right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the method that has been used to ensure that access to the building, which the hon. Lady rightly mentions, is available. However, Stephen Hawking would, of course, need more than that. He would need other facilities such as sound equipment in order to express himself and his typewriter. In school, he would have needed a lot of the equipment that he properly has now in order to obtain the achievements of which he is capable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the key distinction is between someone as distinguished as Stephen Hawking in his present excellent state of mental development, and a child with a condition similar to his. The thrust of our policies is and should be directed towards dealing with the problems that such a child would face. The hon. Member for Cambridge (Mrs. Campbell) is slightly confusing the case of someone such as Stephen Hawking in his fully developed, adult mental state—but with disabilities—with that of a child with those problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right, which is why I tried to imagine him in childhood with the same difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Battersea for giving way again. I used Stephen Hawking as an example, but it is important to realise that many children in our schools are particularly able, but have physical disabilities which prevent them from moving freely around a building that has not been adapted for special use. Surely, the problem lies with the building, not the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us agree that, however we define the problem in the legislation, that child would have difficulty getting the most out of education in the school if there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1061</span>
were physical or other obstacles to his progress. I do not think that we are that far apart; it is just a question of definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath has done us a service by raising the issue. Most members of the Committee agree that we need to assist pupils who have exceptional gifts so that they can steam ahead in education. Many people inside and outside the education world are concerned about that, so it is right for us to have this short debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the points made by the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash. I agreed with some, but not all, of the Plymouth doctrine. From his choice of terms, "swot" may apply to somebody who devotes a lot of time to learning, but is not necessarily an achiever. A person can be a swot without being exceptionally gifted. We should reflect on the insecurity of other pupils who observe those gifted children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The eceptionally gifted child has a special need, but the question is how we tackle the problem and whether the statementing route is helpful. The hon. Member for Devonport was getting near the truth when he referred to the suggestion of the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts that there might be a case for statementing every child. There might be, but that would change the nature of statementing. it would mean that every child's particular need should be catered for by the school. I totally agree that that is what we should seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some children may be gifted or fast-learning in one particular subject. Some children may have lived in France because of their parent's job; they may be bi-lingual and may learn languages fast, so they can forge ahead in French quicker than the rest of the class. A child may be gifted across the board and need special guidance. Such children need to learn at a special speed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash rightly said, if that is not spotted by the teaching staff and if provision is not made in the school, there could be disruption; that child should be stretched according to his or her ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must find ways of speeding up that child's education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that, where possible, the child should be kept within the school environment and should not be allowed to get too far ahead. I despair when I see young children taking unversity degrees and losing out because they have not grown up at school with children of their own age. We must ensure that children's academic needs are met and that they are able to play and learn from their school fellows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system has been criticised. Perhaps we share some guilt because of past policies on mixed ability teaching. Children in a special category should be streamed. That may mean the grammar school route that we debated last week. It could be argued that streaming of particular children is the right way to deal with them, not mixed ability classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, children with particular gifts are often less socially and emotionally developed. It is therefore preferable that they stay with their peers. But a child of very exceptional ability, even in the top set of the grammar school, would still be out of place and be well beyond his or her peers. To argue against mixed ability teaching or in favour of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1062</span>
bringing back of selection misses the point by a long way. We must identify such gifted children and then ensure that, whatever school they are in, their needs are met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not miss the point. All it shows is that the hon. Gentleman accepts that it would be wrong to keep such a gifted child in a mixed ability class.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is clear is that that child must have the attention and specialised teaching to enable him or her to progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments raise the question of whether such provision should be stipulated in the Bill and be part of the statementing process. I have every sympathy with the remarks of the Minister: we must study new ways to deal with pupils of such calibre. The problem of attaching such provisions to statementing is that there are always delays in the process, which I seek to overcome. We may have debates on that later. I hope that statementing is given a higher priority among the education authorities, but without adding another tranche to the process. I do not seek to introduce it here, but we must study ways of using grants, including education-support grants, to provide facilities for such children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Devonport that we must do more work on teacher training. We could do a lot more to enable teachers to spot pupils who have particular needs and to look after them in the classroom, but I resist tacking that on to the existing system—because I think that we need a new one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sweatshirt that I am wearing for this morning's sitting is meant not as an encouragement for everyone to speak in the debate but to go down to the Moses Room and sign the Spastics Society campaign commitment to help improve the statementing process and what it provides for children with special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the amendments deal with changing special educational needs to particular needs. The Minister said that the change has a certain attraction, but, like him, I feel that to change at this stage to "particular needs" would muddy the waters at a time when we know that the system set up by the 1981 Act is not working uniformly well. Once we know that the system works uniformly well, we may refer in a general way to "particular educational needs."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 660 describes a child who
	<br><blockquote><p>"has displayed a consistent capacity to learn exceptionally quickly."</p></blockquote>
Like the Minister and the hon. Member for Battersea said, I wondered about the wisdom of putting the proposal in this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having looked for a point at which to initiate a brief debate, I advised members of the Gifted Children's Information Centre that I did not think it suitable to deal with the subject in clause 139—on reading the Bill, I felt that the only option was a new clause. But a new clause might not have been debated, because of the guillotine. So reluctantly, from the point of view of the association between the amendment and the clause, I tabled an amendment which I am pleased was selected, since it enabled this brief debate to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I hope—the Minister seemed to move towards this—is that the hon. Gentleman will find a place for an amendment or a new clause that would impose on local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1063</span>
education authorities the duty to make it policy to cater for children who learn exceptionally quickly. I hope that the Minister will support this idea. After all, this is an Education Bill and the Government have a wide brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been important, interesting and wide ranging. It might be worth reflecting upon an earlier Committee debate in which hon. Members conversed about expectations. There was a consensus that our schools did not have high enough expectations of some children. It was agreed that we must ensure that the education system provides the mechanisms to stretch all children to the best of their abilities. That applies not only to children covered by the Bill's definition of children with special educational needs but to other categories, including those to whom we referred as academically gifted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are genuinely concerned that there are no mechanisms in current legislation—and certainly not in the Bill—to ensure opportunities for children to avail themselves of their rights under the Government's parents charter, which states that parents have the right to a proper education for their children. This must encompass children of all categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also worried about the comments of the hon. Member for Battersea, who takes the view that merely streaming children will somehow solve the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely not. I suggested that mixed ability did not help. I went on to say that I was looking for new education support grants into which to put resources to try to meet pupils' needs—not to mention teacher training. I do not believe that streaming is enough. Much more is needed for these pupils. We need a fresh initiative and a new method, but not this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that a Conservative Member of Parliament has placed on record a call for additional resources for education. Every member of the Committee will welcome that and wish him the best of luck in his campaign with his colleagues on the Front Bench and in the Treasury to ensure that his call is heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also delighted that the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged that it is not just the grouping of children in classes that is the way forward. However, will he reconsider his apparent blind opposition to mixed-ability teaching? The issue is not necessarily that children are grouped in classes. The way in which they are supported in classes and the way in which we identify their individual needs—be they children with learning difficulties or the academically gifted—are also important. We must identify their needs and provide the means of support to ensure that those needs are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the comments of the hon. Member for Battersea, he is probably concerned with the recent statements from the Secretary of State advocating much greater use of whole-class teaching. In the majority of primary schools in which there is one class for each year, the class will inevitably contain a wide range of abilities. An increase in whole-class teaching would be totally against the wishes of Opposition Members and, from the impression that I received, those of the hon. Gentleman. Whole-class teaching is relevant to the amendment. It reminds me of the well-known phrase, "Ram it in, ram it in. Children's heads are hollow. Ram it in, ram it in. Still there's more to follow." Whole-class teaching is about content rather than teaching methodologies and learning styles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1064</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman recognises that streaming means that the whole of the stream can be taught more effectively than if the children are split up into little groups. To use the hon. Gentleman's analogies on music and sport, we would not have a mixed-ability football team, or a mixed-ability youth orchestra. Certainly, the orchestra would not have more than one conductor and the football team more than one referee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more effective for both the exceptionally gifted child and others in the class if they study at the correct pace with their peers, but have whole-class teaching when appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has tried to clarify his position. However, he fails to accept that, in the large classes—well over 30 pupils—that we have as a result of the shortage of resources, the concept that 30 children have identical needs and can be taught in exactly the same way is a pipe-dream. Classroom reality is not how the hon. Gentleman imagines it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that whole-class teaching in most primary schools means talking to all of a mixed-ability group at one time? Surely by doing that and not splitting the class into groups, which recognise the individual needs of pupils, one lowers standards and stultifies the abilities of the brightest in the class. Whole-class teaching has held back bright children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I had thought that I had said that in my own way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult for you, Sir John, if we pursue the issue of whole-class teaching further, but it has illustrated the importance of identifying the needs of individual children and seeking the most appropriate ways to assist them in achieving their full potential. As the hon. Members for Erewash and for Battersea have said, fears exist that the needs of groups of children are not properly met by current legislation and practice. Today's debate has given us the opportunity to consider the range of anxieties that people have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was worried by the Minister's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried by the Minister's remarks. In his brief speech, he suggested that, in some way or other, the national curriculum would ensure that the needs of academically gifted children are met, but the national curriculum relates to content and not to teaching methodology or to learning styles. Those issues must be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of definition is causing confusion, even for Conservative Members. I apologise that I keep referring to the hon. Member for Battersea. However, he spoke most in the debate. He said that a learning difficulty should be defined as an obstacle to progress. Many people who do not fall within the definition in clause 139 have obstacles to progress which should be included in the support mechanisms covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cambridge cited the interesting example of Stephen Hawking. Another example is that of a child who is diagnosed as dyslexic. Such a child may well be very able although may not have achieved high attainments and, because of the frustration that he or she suffers, might also become disruptive and show poor behaviour in school. That child meets all three categories that are covered in paragraph 1.52 of the White Paper and yet are not covered in the definitions in clause 139.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue the point about my constituent, Stephen Hawking. At the risk of being unkind to the hon. Member for Battersea, if he were in a building that had exceptionally narrow doorways, I wonder whether he would be identified as having a learning difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear to be accepted that academically gifted children need additional attention to that which they currently receive. The hon. Member for Erewash and, indeed, the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) said that to include them in the present definition would—they both used the same words—muddy the water. Such phrases imply that the current definition relates to a uniform group of people, but those covered by the definition of special educational needs are an incredibly diverse group, both in their needs and in the type of support that is necessary for them. The idea that there is uniformity within the definition worries me enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The hon. Gentleman mentioned dyslexia. As he knows, I raised that important aspect of special educational needs in a debate the other day. Surely the hon. Gentleman recognises that dyslexia falls within the scope of this measure. Indeed, I believe that many of the appeals that are heard relate to the provision for dyslexia. What was his argument in suggesting that it is not covered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 1.51 of the Government's White Paper defines three different groups. One group relates to the child who has particular behavioural problems. Perhaps analysis of that child's behavioural problems will lead to identification of a learning difficulty. Learning difficulties might be identified in the other categories. That is why all those categories are together: they identify particular needs that must be tackled. The amendment would enable us to deal with the problems and to ensure that individual children reach their fullest potential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could range widely on this important debate but I doubt, Sir John, that you would want me to go on much longer. Despite the assurance that Conservative Members are concerned about the matter, there has been no sign that they have any intention of tabling any amendment to the Bill, which the Government claim will last for 25 years and which is clearly highly important. Therefore, it is important to press the amendment to a Division, so that the attitude of the Committee can be placed on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 665, in page 83, line 19, at beginning insert 'education'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1066</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 666, 667 and 668.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 665 would clarify the point that the education facilities referred to in the definition of "learning difficulty" are the responsibility of the local education authority and not the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 666 to clause 148 makes it clear that the decision to make a statement is the authority's and not the parents. Amendments Nos. 667 and 668 to clause 149 clarify that the reference is to the decision of the local education authority to make an assessment, not to any other decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I decided not to move the group of amendments in my name because I felt that their substance could be dealt with sufficiently in a clause stand part debate. Clause 139 repeats a provision of the Education Act 1981 but adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or grant-maintained schools in their area".</p></blockquote>
The Government believe that taking account of grant-maintained schools is the only improvement that they need to make. The clause raises important issues about the role of the LEA and its overview of special educational needs, and that of grant-maintained schools in providing for their pupils who have such needs. Does the Minister believe that the LEA's powers, especially its ability to oversee special educational needs provision in grant-maintained schools, are sufficiently well defined?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child in a grant-maintained school has a statement, the LEA's role is clear. However, only 2 per cent, of children are likely to receive a statement in a local authority area. In some local authorities, the percentage is higher. Only a small proportion of children who will experience special learning difficulties in their school lives receive statements. Will the Minister outline how the system will cater for children with special educational needs in the maintained and the grant-maintained sectors?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the system work when more than 75 per cent. of pupils in a local authority area attend grant-maintained schools and only a small minority of schools—perhaps none in the secondary sector—are maintained by the LEA? In such circumstances, the local authority's role in ensuring proper provision for children with special educational needs could become more difficult. Later, we shall have a debate on the role and duties of governors in grant-maintained schools, and that may help to clarify the matter. The Minister should tell the Committee how an LEA will have sufficient powers to ensure observance of its standards for special educational needs in all GM schools in its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer briefly to matters raised in the debate on earlier amendments. Simply to include grant-maintained schools in the 1981 provisions is not enough when we consider what has happened in the past 10 years. Part III includes some improvements in the light of the Audit Commission report "Getting on with the Act" the Spastics Society report "A Hard Act to Follow" and the report that the Spastics Society and the National Union of Teachers commissioned from Coopers and Lybrand to examine access to mainstream education for disabled children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1067</span>
I would have thought that the Government realised that what is provided in clause 139(2)(b) is inadequate. The paragraph states that a child will have a learning difficulty if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he has a disability which either prevents or hinders him from making use of education facilities of a kind generally provided for children of his age in schools within the area of the local authority".</p></blockquote>
In an earlier debate, we sought to make it clear that no child should be excluded from a school on the ground of access. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge has discussed the subject extensively and the hon. Member for Battersea made several interventions. If our amendment on this matter had been accepted—which would have stopped the exclusion of, for example, a child in a wheelchair from a school where not all the doors were sufficiently wide, there was an excessive number of steps in parts of it or areas which were difficult to reach—the provisions in the clause, which repeat the 1981 Act, would be sufficient. Mere repetition means that the Government have not yet grappled with the need to overcome the basic failings that occur under that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will have been able to pick up examples, not only from the HMI and Audit Commission report, but from the two other reports which I have mentioned. No doubt individuals have made representations to them when a child with an access and not a learning problem has not been catered for. The Government are not making progress in dealing with such cases by repreating the provisons of the 1981 Act in the clause. When we discuss clause 140, we will perhaps be told that the Government want a code of practice to take account of such things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt that I had to discuss this matter, even though students sometimes co-operate and help pupils with an access problem to continue their education in a mainstream school. For example, when I taught at Cowbridge comprehensive school from 1976 to 79 a pupil had spina bifida and was in a wheelchair for a lot of the time, but she could sometimes move with crutches. Her classmates would heroically pick her up in the wheelchair and carry her upstairs to classes such as history, which was held on the first floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems can be overcome if people put in a lot of effort, but the proper answer is to include basic necessary provision in the Bill. If the Government had accepted our amendments, which would have made access for all a fundamental part of the Bill, we would not have needed to discuss the matter again. I hope that the Minister will respond to that now or in our debate on the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 139(5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Part of this Act, "child" includes any person who has not attained the age of nineteen years and is a registered pupil at a school."</p></blockquote>
Given the provisions in the rest of the Bill and in the 1981 Act, it would seem that that subsection excludes from consideration of special educational needs a person who is over 16 and is not a registered pupil at the school. Many organisations raised that exclusion with us. The amendment that I withdrew had been put to us by the Special Education Consortium. It said that although it did not require the amendent to be pressed to achieve its objective, the question had to be debated so that the Minister could tell us how that group of children would be catered for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1068</span>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deaf Accord and SENSE have expressed anxiety about young people with multi-sensory impairment who have severe and profound learning difficulties. Such young people between the ages of 16 and 19 may not necessarily be in a school, which would meet their complex needs, or in college. SENSE has been working to ensure that appropriate specialist further education provision is available for young people with multi-sensory impairment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that a young person such as he has just described is likely to be educated in an institution other than a special school? From what he says, it is probable that that young person would be educated in a special school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raise the point because Deaf Accord and SENSE are working with some young people between the ages of 16 and 19 who are not registered pupils in schools or in further education colleges undertaking courses under schedule 2 to the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. They seem to fall between two stools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Special Education Consortium has discussed the matter with officials in the Department for Education, if not with the Minister, to try to discover what provision can be made, in view of subsection (5) and particularly in view of the advice given to it that simply to take out the qualification of being a registered pupil at the school would go further than it wants to go to protect the interests of children between 16 and 19 who had special educational needs but were no longer registered in schools or colleges of further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. I recall many instances where, in a sort of federation of sixth-form levels between a school and a further education college, pupils might spend more time in the college than in the school, but might nevertheless be registered at the school. Perhaps I can add to the hon. Gentleman's point about a child being excluded from a school but not yet placed in another. In that instance, is there a little black hole down which the child would disappear, or would LEAs be able to register the child with the original school until, technically, he is placed? Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall deal with that when we consider matters relating to school attendance orders and how they might be affected by the black hole to which the hon. Member for Battersea referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the question of schedule 2 in relation to colleges of further education and funding, to which children with special needs would usually have access if they were on further education courses. What especially worries the Special Education Consortium is that life skills courses for young people with more significant handicaps fall outside the scope of schedule 2 provisions. Funding for those courses will apparently remain the responsibility of the LEA, although such pupils will most likely not be registered at a school, so therefore those courses would not be covered by the Further Education Funding Council provisions. Provision must be made for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that, in future, such students must be registered at a school. I look forward to his response to these questions as well as to the point about access. Will he also say how, when more than 75 per cent. of pupils are in grant-maintained schools, the LEA will be able to deal with the gamut of special educational needs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1069</span>
provision, especially when that falls outside the statementing process. That is exceedingly important because the majority of special needs children are not subject to that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Faber 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to add a few words to the debate as I make a maiden speech in Committee, as Opposition Members will be pleased to point out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great interest to the issues raised by the hon. Member for Bath and to the dialogue between my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths). I saw a gifted child when I was fortunate enough to receive my degree on the same day as Ruth Lawrence. The only slight difference was that whereas I received one lowly BA, she came round several times in several differently coloured gowns to receive several degrees. It was a salutary lesson to all who were present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that we have at last reached part III of the Bill. I welcome warmly the Government's commitment to special educational needs. Clause 139 is instrumental in defining the remainder of this part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Debates on special educational needs are often tacked onto the end of Second Reading debates. On the Bill's Second Reading it was interesting to note that several speeches from hon. Members on both sides of the House were devoted almost exclusively to its special needs provisions. I found that encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bridgend for giving us time to discuss this clause. I feared that we might not get to it. I should like to develop some of the points that I made in my speech on Second Reading, especially on subsection 139(2)(a), which still gives me cause for concern. It contains the broad definition of a child with special needs. It states that a child has a learning difficulty if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he has a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children of his age".</p></blockquote>
I welcome the fact that the Bill reviews much of the 1981 Act, which followed the Warnock report. That report was a watershed—dare I say, a landmark—at the time that it was published. Warnock provided a basis for the identification of children with special educational needs and a framework for the rights of those children and the responsibilities of LEAs. It replaced a system that had previously categorised those children more on medical grounds than on purely educational grounds. It gave us a statutory system of access which gave parents clear rights of involvement and of appeal. It emphasised the need to identify early and to provide for learning difficulties. It recommended that provision should be made by the LEA for children with special educational needs which should be clearly detailed in a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Warnock report also required children to be educated in ordinary schools, subject to four conditions. I welcome the Bill's reaffirmation of that principle. However, Warnock acknowledged that while up to 20 per cent. of all children may have a learning difficulty of some kind, only 2 per cent. would be severe enough to merit a statement. The definition in clause 139(2)(a) was possibly satisfactory in 1981, but over the years the number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1070</span>
children being statemented has increased both in authorities that have been conscientious about statementing and in those where it has been ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1981 statementing has been the responsibility of the LEA, and it is now widely acknowledged that few are happy with the system. I shall use examples from my county of Wiltshire to show that the definition in clause 139 has led to considerable confusion. It has arisen from the definition of a special need. The regulations have been interpreted in various ways in different authorities. The differing levels of special needs are widely interpreted within an authority. Some LEAs statement many children to obtain additional funding from the Department, whereas others conveniently pretend that only a few children in their area need a statement. I am appalled that some LEAs do not even recognise the terms "autism" or "dyslexia", choosing to use other, more convenient, terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those differences have been vividly highlighted in the Audit Commission's report "Getting in on the Act". Of the 12 LEAs sampled, the percentage of children with statements ranged from 0·8 per cent, up to 3·3 per cent. I can give two extreme examples. In 1990, East Sussex—the LEA of my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mrs. Lait)—statemented just one in 2,000 children; and at the other extreme my LEA in Wiltshire will this year statement 4·5 per cent. of children and that figure is rapidly rising. That is the highest number in the south-west, and one of the highest in primary education in the entire country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission's report says that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"lack of clarity both about what constitutes special educational needs and about the respective responsibilities of the school and LEA"</p></blockquote>
represents a serious deficiency in the way in which special needs are dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not as simple as that and that we should consider resources as well as the number of children who are statemented?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an LEA puts resources into special needs, it is sometimes unnecessary to do as much statementing as other authorities which do not put as much resources into special needs and which have to statement to get the resources. The Select Committee on Education will shortly visit two authorities: one that frequently statements and another that does not statement as much. Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the resources issue may explain why there is a discrepancy in statementing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Faber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that may be so in some authorities, but I do not think that generally it can be attributed only to resources. I assumed that, at some stage, an Opposition Member would jump up and remind me of resources and underfunding. The Audit Commission's results show that many problems in LEAs were not a result of underfunding. Perhaps the Select Committee on Education would like to visit Wiltshire, where funding has been consistently increased over the past eight or nine years. Funding of special educational needs is more than double what it was in 1984, yet we continue to statement a high number of children. While the hon. Gentleman's point may hold good in certain authorities, I do not think that it should be followed as a general rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Threshold criteria are not determined on a national basis, a fact which I think should change. For example, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1071</span>
Wiltshire the threshold to obtain the statement is two years for children aged eight, three years for those aged nine and 10, four years for those aged 11, and five years for those aged 13. Again, that varies widely under different authorities. Until there is uniformity, there will be children in some authorities who are disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From our own post-bag and from people who visit us at our surgeries we all know that for many parents the road to a statement is a long trail of disputes, misunderstandings and sleepless nights. A fax that I received yesterday comes from a good friend of mine in my constituency. He is a local business man, of considerable standing in Melksham, who has been involved in community work for many years and who is chairman of the Mid-Wilts Dyslexia Association. He has been involved in community work for about 25 years and he is a governor of the local school. He states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is so much heartbreak out there within the statementing process and having recently been elected to the National Executive of the British Dyslexia Association, I realise how important it is for you and fellow likeminded MPs to transcend the old dogmas, to allow all children to achieve their full potential."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that any members of the Committee would disagree with that. We should address that problem seriously if we are to consider uniformity in the statementing of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the first Audit Commission report, all 12 LEAs surveyed took longer than six months to issue their statements. The average was one year, and in one scandalous example an LEA took three years to statement a child, by which time the statement was worse than useless for the child and the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conventional idea of special needs is of an obvious handicap—of, for example, a child in a wheelchair, or with a hearing aid, or with partial sight. But we have already agreed today that the problems go wider. In my constituency—and, I am sure, in the constituencies of all hon. Members—the main area of expansion has been that of moderate learning difficulties. We have already discussed dyslexia this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I refer to the Warnock report. Baroness Mary Warnock stated that a 2 per cent. group should qualify for statements. Dyslexia and autism were also mentioned in the report, yet were not among the list of 20 conditions that would automatically qualify for a statement. There are many thousands of children in the country who suffer from dyslexia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past schools have been expected to provide for such children within their normal resources. For instance, in Wiltshire in 1983 only 1·8 per cent. of children were statemented. That is just within the 2 per cent. threshold. Yet now, as I have already told the Committee, the fig31ure has risen to 4·5 per cent. Public awareness has grown, and with it have sprung up high-powered pressure groups which now work alongside charities. I do not criticise them. Indeed, I am very proud to be the vice-president of the Mid-Wilts Dyslexia Association and to give it all the support that I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Increasingly, however, as we know from our surgeries, such bodies seek recourse to appeals to the Department for Education and even to law. I understand that up to 50 per cent. of appeals received by the Department now relate to dyslexia. At least one threat of judicial review against the local education authority is outstanding in Wiltshire. I read recently that in another LEA the local government
	<span class='label label-info column'>1072</span>
ombudsman has made an award of some £5,000 to a dyslexic child, whom he considered the local education authority was not serving correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result is damaging for all concerned—for the officers on the local education authority and for the psychologists whose job it is to issue statements. They cannot keep up with demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman's speech and I agree with a great deal of it, but I should like to make a technical point. The psychologists are only part of the statementing procedure. They write the appendix C. The statement is issued by a special needs panel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Faber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I acknowledge that. Very often the problem lies with the experts. I fully accept that the psychologists perform only one part of the statementing process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vicious circle tends to develop, and the officers responsible, the psychologists and the panel can all become disillusioned. Confidence ebbs and morale is sapped. I fear that that has happened recently in Wiltshire. There is already a system there of delegating responsibility, through local management of schools, from the local education authority to schools. I know that we shall discuss that issue later under another clause. However, if we are to provide good quality education for the children concerned it is vital that provision be well defined and the outcome carefully monitored. The diagnosis must be accurate from the very start of a child's school career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many children who fall not within the 2 per cent. but within the other 18 per cent. do not, as we have heard already, show challenging behaviour. They sit quietly in class. Often, if the diagnosis is not correctly made early on, it may be a long time before such children are acknowledged to have special needs. Tragically, that is often not acknowledged until they go for training or to look for a job—it can be as late as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) has mentioned funding. I believe that the Audit Commission rejected the accusation that underfunding was a specific problem contributing to difficulty in giving statements. Often, a managerial problem was to blame. The commission pointed out that in the case of delays in assessing for statement, the LEAs that act most quickly often do not devote more administrative time and thus more resources to the task. Some LEAs, on the other hand, have given up trying to issue statements and have not devoted any resources to doing so. The matter is thus not purely one of underfunding. In Wiltshire, as I have already pointed out, funding has been increased enormously in recent years to try to cope with the additional numbers of children being statemented. That is why I believe that the definition of a special need should be examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman feel—he seems to imply it—that it is always the fault of the local education authority when statements are not issued in time? Figures from Cambridgeshire suggest that 15 out of 33 statements could not be produced in the six months because advice was awaited from other agencies, in particular health authorities. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Faber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to go into that, but since the hon. Lady has mentioned it, I agree. I am not trying to put the blame purely on local education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0698">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1073</span>
I acknowledge the difficulties that they face because of the very wide definition of special needs that we now, inevitably, have. Pressure is put on LEAs because, as I know only too well, health service or other third-party reports delay a statement. However, if the definition for the statementing could be more precise and if it could establish details more accurately, everyone would find it easier to decide whether or not to issue the statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard rumours of some form of guidelines—statutory or not—being introduced alongside the Bill. I hope that the Minister will refer to them. I also hope that he will discuss the code of practice to be established by clause 140, which we shall probably not debate. Will he tell us what the consultation period will be and when we shall have further news about the code of practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill carries forward many of the things that we wish to see done for children with special educational needs, but I fear that the definition will allow too many LEAs to avoid, for whatever reason, giving a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his well-researched speech, the hon. Gentleman quoted Mary Warnock. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman also examined her evidence to the Select Committee, before Christmas, in which she said that, on reflection, she felt that statementing was not necessarily the best device for helping children with special needs. That blows apart many of the hon. Gentleman's arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Faber</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am ashamed to say that I have not read that evidence, but I am interested to hear those views. That may be the case, but is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that statementing should be abolished altogether? Some children need the protection of a statement. Until the definition of that statement is tightened, there will continue to be chaos and confusion within some, if not all, LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us whether there are plans for more guidelines to operate alongside the Bill. Failing that, will he explain what we can expect to see in the code of practice, as that might go a long way to resolving many of the problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham for being called to speak before him. It is his perpetual fate to be called at five minuters to 1 pm and for his speech to be interrupted by lunch. I shall try to be brief so that he has time to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of special needs in clause 139 is almost exactly the same as that in the Education Act 1981. I accept that there is some cross-party agreement that that Act has been a success. From my experiences of working for a LEA, I know dozens of children who have benefited from its provisions. We could argue around the edges about the resourcing of the Act, but the Act itself has been a success. That does not mean that the definition of special needs contained in it could not be improved upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Bath quoting the Chairman of the Select Committee who said that a sensible, round-table discussion with the educational world before the Bill was introduced would have been to everyone's benefit. The Minister said that the current definition of special educational needs, as contained in the 1981 Act and, broadly, in the clause, has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1074</span>
been widely accepted. It would have been very surprising if it were not, given that it is the law and that the statementing process has been with us for 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and Minister did not spend enough time speaking to the people who they have repeatedly dismissively referred to as the "educational establishment" before they introduced the proposals. I have spoken to people who work in education, particularly psychologists, about the nature of the statementing definition. Some parts of the clause cause great difficulty. Under clause 139(2)(a), a child has a learning difficulty if: 	<br><blockquote><p>"he has a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of children of his age".</p></blockquote>
I can imagine how difficult it will be for teachers and psychologists to make an adequate working definition of the word "significantly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard complaints about delays in the statementing process—another phrase with which I am unhappy. It would be better to stick with the phrase "formal assessment", because "statementing process" implies that the outcome of every assessment is a statement, which clearly is not so. We have heard much about the delays in that process of assessment. One of the reasons for delay is the dispute over the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also heard this morning of children with mobility difficulties being defined under subsection (2)(b) as having a learning difficulty because of problems of access. That is crazy, given the time needed to resolve such problems, not only by professionals, but by parents and children. From the sending of the LEA's first letter, saying that a child may have special educational needs, to the consultation process taking account of the views of the parents, the teachers and the psychologists, to the draft and final statements can take months, and it is incredibly expensive. Yet that process has to be undergone by and on behalf of children who have no learning difficulty but whose only problem is getting into the building. If one wanted to encapsulate in the Bill a better definition of special needs, it would not be about children who have difficulty accessing the curriculum, but childen who have difficulty accessing the buildings. The chances of a child with a mobility difficulty attending the local school—what the Minister might call the parent's expressed choice of school—depend entirely on the equal opportunities practices of the local education authority and the resources that it gives to equal opportunities for access. It cannot be left to chance, depending on which LEA area one happens to live in; best practice should be written into the Bill.

Exceptionally able children are not covered by that definition. We heard that such children can suffer behaviour difficulties. However, a wider group is affected—that is children who have emotional and behavioural difficulties anyway. Both the 1981 Act and the Bill ignore the needs of those children. Before Christmas, we discussed how schools often see it as a soft option to exclude temporarily or indefinitely those pupils with behavioural difficulties. The Government refused to accept that a safeguard should be written into the 1981 Act. They have neglected to protect such children in the Bill. Those children are often unwanted by schools, and are excluded from the schools or playing truant because they cannot cope in the classroom. It is often time consuming for the professionals involved, including the educational psychologists and education welfare officers, to help those

	<span class='label label-info column'>1075</span>
children, yet their needs have been bypassed by the Bill. All children who have special needs are vulnerable, but those with behavioural difficulties are the most vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the definition given in clause 139 works in the 1981 Act. There is no complaint about that. Some Opposition Members put into practice the provisions of the 1981 Act before becoming Members of Parliament. However, the definition can be improved. The Bill is a series of missed opportunities, especially for the vulnerable people to whom I have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, as I should hate to spoil the intact record of the hon. Member for City of Durham for speaking when the bell goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard this morning the extent of agreement between all hon. Members on special education needs provision and the need for statementing. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea said that statementing was a tortuous and lengthy process. We are all aware of that. The discussion between my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Cambridge revealed that—again as we are all aware—the period of six months is often not adhered to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my visits to schools in my constituency, another practical issue is apparent—there are times when I can find it in my heart to be sorry for East Sussex education authority. A problem arises when a child moves in the middle of the statementing process from one education authority to another. I have not been able to discover who is right and who is wrong in that process, but when children move from one education authority to another, the records often do not move with them, or the receiving education authority does not accept the evidence, records and statements of the other authority. We all agree that resources should be used wisely and better, so it would be useful to make clear to education authorities their precise responsibilities when a child moves from one education authority to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the guillotine will fall at 12.50 pm, I have only 10 minutes. I compliment the hon. Member for Westbury (Mr. Taber) on a good speech. I listened with interest to it and agreed with much of what he said. My hon. Friend the Member for Devonport pointed out to him the new views on statementing of Baroness Warnock. The evidence to the Select Committee from many sources show that most people accept that the statementing of children is the correct procedure, although it may need to be reformed. I cannot be certain, but I suspect that statementing will continue, albeit in an altered fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the heart of the clause, of which I have some experience, and to special educational needs pupils when they reach the age of 16. I intended to speak to amendment No. 420, but it was not moved. I was headmaster of a special school for children from four to 16 years and, often, up to 18 years. I could not let discussion of the clause go by without drawing attention to the problems that we encountered. I tried to bring up the matter when we discussed the Education Reform Bill five years ago, but the then Minister took no notice of me. I hope that the present Minister will be more sympathetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most students leave school at 16 to go into further or higher education, or training. The lucky few actually get a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1076</span>
job. However, those with special educational needs often have nothing to look forward to after school. Very little provision is made for them. Many of the children with moderate learing difficulties who attended my school had nowhere to go when they left and vegetated at home. I and my colleagues spent many hours in case conferences trying to find relevant places for those pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no political point when I say that, up to 1979, many of the children whom I taught would, on leaving school, get a job on a building site or elsewhere. My statistics show that in those days about 70 per cent. of the pupils at that school found a job or placement. However, by the time that I left the school in 1987, not one child was going into work when he or she left school at 16, and very few were going on to any other education or training. It often happened that, after a case conference had been held, I allowed children to stay on at school for two more years. I do not mean to be unprofessional when I say that many schools took children up to the age of 18 specifically because the children counted as points and they got extra resources for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most schools do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that my hon. Friend is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the lack of resources—by which I mean staff—we could not plan a relevant programme for children aged 16. The result was that they stayed at school and merely repeated the work that they had done before they entered the senior class. In one way, the ones that stayed on where lucky: they were still in education and so were getting some form of training. However, the ones who did not stay at school tended to vegetate at home because they could find nowhere else to go. They still had special educational needs, but no provision was made for them. The clause as drafted would mean that those children would still be forgotten because they would not be registered at a school. I emphasise that more resources should be directed to those pupils, and that those resources should be ring-fenced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, courses for children who left school at 16 would be set up at the local college of further education. However, those courses would be the first to be dropped when resources became scarce, with the result that we were back to square one. Some colleges still provide for those pupils, but the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 has complicated the matter. Now, local education authorities no longer have responsibility for further education. The 1992 Act only requires colleges to have regard to students with special educational needs. The weakness of that Act is that there is no secure interface covering the period between post-16 students leaving school and starting at college. In all honesty, I am not sure if such an interface existed even before the 1992 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a student who remains at school after 16 is guaranteed education, no such guarantee exists if that student wishes to go to college. Colleges are not required to liaise with local education authorities or with schools to ensure the continuation of quality educational provision. The clause does not guarantee that and neither does the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. I apologise for gabbling but I am trying to say everything that I want to say and we have only a couple of minutes left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than preventing it, the clause should ensure that local education authorities have responsibility for offering education to post-16 students with special educational
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0700">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1077</span>
needs who are not at school if the local college is not offering appropriate provision. If the clause is changed, it would greatly improve, not just the Bill but the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will take into account my views and those of my hon. Friends on the Front Bench and ensure that the clause is amended on Report or on Third Reading so that it can ensure improvements to the inadequate provision that existed before the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. We are now in a position to make improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for rushing and I hope that I am making sense. My final point is a question rather than a statement. My question concerns—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is shaking his head. I wonder what the problem is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no point asking the question because there will be no time to answer it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question concerns the assessment of pupils after 16 who enter colleges of further and higher education. I assume that the colleges, not the local education authorities, are responsible for the purchase of the educational psychology service. Will the Minister say what will happen if the colleges or the further and higher education funding council refuse to provide resources for that need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can relax and be as expansive as ever in the two minutes left to me at the end of our interesting debate. It is all very well members of the Committee asking me questions, but on other occasions they might consider allowing a little time for the answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answers to most of the questions lie in other clauses. Had we come to clause 140, I would have been able to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury because the code of practice, to which I may be able to refer on a subsequent occasion, would answer many of his points. I would have been able to say more to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1078</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye because the answer to her question lies deep in paragraph 8(2) of schedule 9. However, it is probably the case that although a receiving authority may have to take account of the assessment of the child's needs, we cannot oblige the receiving authority to take the whole statement because the provision of the needs may be different in the receiving authority than in the originating authority. Perhaps we can return to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the important questions asked by the hon. Member for Bridgend can be answered when we get to clause 144 and my amendment to it. I shall introduce a potent tool to ensure that grant-maintained and other schools will be forced to make regular, detailed statements about what they are doing to fulfil special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to accept clause 139 at this stage, secure in the knowledge that later clauses will be built on by regulations and pronouncements, which will deal with many of the points that have been made. I shall try to return to the points made by the hon. Member for City of Durham, but if I do not, I shall write to him. I believe that, for example, recent developments and an imminent announcement by the Further Education Funding Council will—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
