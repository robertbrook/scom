	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should remind the Committee that the amendment deals with the need for regional committees. The Minister told us during a previous sitting that the funding agency would be classified as a non-departmental public body. I am probably one of the few members of the Committee who has read the 1985 handbook on non-departmental public bodies. I used to work for such an organisation—the National Institute of Agricultural Botany, which is no longer a NDPB. It had a successful system of regional centres and committees. It would be a good model for the new funding agency for schools, as would the Funding Council for Further Education, to which my hon. Friends referred earlier, which also has a similar regional structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall set the scene by describing regional differences between schools and areas. I listened with interest to hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies, and who described the system in Wales. There are differences between England and Wales and I understand why a separate schools funding council should exist for Wales. However, differences also exist within England. The areas that I know best are my constituency in Cambridge and the west riding of Yorkshire, where I was born and brought up and spent many happy years of school life. I was educated at an excellent comprehensive school—one of the first in the north of England. The school was established in 1392 and is probably older than many of the public schools that Conservative Members attended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My knowledge of Cambridge schools is based on the fact that my three children attended state schools there. The youngest has just left. Comprehensive schools in Cambridge provide an excellent education. From my experience in the north of England and that of my children in Cambridge, I know that enormous differences exist between those areas. There are differences between types of schools and their organisation, and in traditions and social attitudes. There are also similarities. The comprehensive school that I attended and the school that my children attended had extremely high standards. Both coped well with a range of academic and practical subjects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady agree—I am sure that she would—that the difference in quality between the schools that she describes depends above all on the quality of the head teacher and the staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I would agree with that. It would also depend on excellent support from the local authority.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
It is important that we have high quality staff who have high morale and are well motivated. That comes from good management and the excellent care provided by the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are all good examples of state comprehensive education, but differences also exist. Cambridge probably has a larger proporation of parents who expect their children to go on to higher education. Most of the parents of the children in Cambridge schools have BAs, MAs of PhDs—some are even fellows of the Royal Society. A very different environment existed in the school that I attended. Parents there were often coal miners—although there will not be many of those left soon—and farmers, who may have had different aspirations for their children. However, a high standard is very important to all parents, despite the difference in traditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also differences in school organisation. Each region of the country has a different historical tradition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt but the hon. Lady will realise that the amendment deals with committees to be set up by a funding authority. I cannot at the moment relate her remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I was not making the context clear, Sir John. I was trying to illustrate the need for regional committees by drawing attention to the great differences between regions of the country. I hope that the application of my argument will become clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My school served 11 to 18-year-olds, and had its own sixth form. Other areas of the country favour middle schools, while still others favour tertiary colleges. The schools in Cambridge are for 11 to 16-year-olds and there are sixth form colleges or further education colleges. They have a very different tradition and structure. In addition, there are very real differences in the way that rural and urban communitites organise education, of which local education authorities are very aware. If we are to replace local education authorities with a body that will operate almost as effectively, we must ensure that there is continuity in awareness of the knowledge and experience of the local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency for schools will have to make a number of decisions. It will examine new buildings for expansion, decide which schools are to close and look at facilities for children with special educational needs. It is important that the funding agency does not adopt a uniform solution, regardless of local needs. Will members of the funding agency be aware that in some areas a large proportion of children with special educational needs suffer behavioural and emotional problems? It is important that that is understood, because those children are the most expensive of all to educate. The recent study by the Audit Commission found that children with special educational needs and behavioural and emotional difficulties were sometimes twice as expensive to educate as children with physical disabilities or with learning difficulties.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. Although I sit in front of my hon. Friend, I have difficulty hearing her because of the noise coming from other quarters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have been having similar difficulty. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that the buzz of conversation will abate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. Children with emotional and behavioural difficulties are often the most expensive to educate. It is important that members of funding authorities realise that. Children from deprived and poor backgrounds often suffer those difficulties. Regional funding committees will be much more in touch with local areas, and therefore able more easily to determine the problems of children there and to provide appropriate funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that regional assemblies has long been Labour party policy. A regional assembly that could co-ordinate the government of an area in terms of education, planning, transport, trade and industry would be ideal. In my view, regional government combined with unitary authorities is the most sensible way to devolve power. That applies to the agency principle. A funding agency that devolves power to local regional committees is the most sensible way to proceed. A central funding agency is akin to central Government keeping all powers at the centre and not allowing any to be devolved to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall read a submission from the director of education in Cambridgeshire. He stated:
	<br><q><p>"I am pleased to submit a response on the White Paper. The comments that follow are my own, as Director of Education for this Authority, but they are formulated in the light of a well-attended seminar for all members of the county council from all political parties."</p></q>
Members of the Committee will be aware that Cambridgeshire is a Conservative-controlled authority. The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"Overall the move towards a standard funding formula, nationally, for all pupils has much to be said in its favour. It does not follow, however, that planning could or should be organised by a national body."</p></q>
He is saying that devolution to local level is important. He continues:
	<br><q><p>"Planning and the supply of school places requires effective local co-ordination in order to evaluate the developmental implications for an area."</p></q>
I hope that the Government will take that point on board and support the idea of regional committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 32. In my opinion, the funding agency is a thoroughly bad idea. The whole concept of a national, centralised organisation running education is deplorable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the National Union of Teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am very proud of the NUT, my friend, very proud indeed. Despite being interrupted from a sedentary position by that very rude Conservative Member, I shall try, Sir John, to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not bother.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will bother and I shall make every effort to stay here as long as need be to make my speech. No only is it a bad idea, but it is possibly a disastrous idea, especially if it is purely a national organisation. At least to dilute the damage, the agency must have some local knowledge. A national organisation based and administered, perhaps in London—we are not certain where—cannot know the regional diversity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, give me a chance to start my argument and then I shall give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
The agency will not be democratic and will not be accountable to local people; it will be accountable only to the Secretary of State. It must know at least the areas that it will administer. Without knowing that, it cannot possibly hope to be a success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested not in the argument but in the grammar. I know that the hon. Member for Hemsworth is not yet with us, which is perhaps why the hon. Gentleman is stringing out his argument. I believe that the hon. Gentleman was the headmaster of a school: I cannot believe that he is supporting an amendment which has the grammer so wrong that it refers to "not less than seven" instead of "not fewer than seven".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be "no fewer".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman satisfied?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative members have a patronising attitude. We all know exactly what the amendment means: if you are too thick to understand the argument, then you have problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have no problems at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dewsbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend would care to explore the Government's definitive preference of the wording of the amendment. The hon. Member for Battersea suggested that the wording should be "not fewer"; the Under-Secretary then corrected him by saying, "no fewer". It would be worth exploring which is the official Government line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be honest, I am not particularly interested in the opinions of the hon. Member for Battersea or of the Under-Secretary. I am arguing about the deplorable suggestion that we should have a funding agency, which is centrally controlled, undemocratic and unrepresentative of the people who live in that particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers of the funding authorities, as described in schedule 1, are wide-ranging and I think that it is important that we understand them. They have been continually quoted in the Committee. We should get on record the actual powers that are in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When 10 per cent. of pupil numbers for a sector in an LEA area are in grant-maintained schools, the funding agency will have the power and responsibility to: first, prepare an annual review and report on supply of grant-maintained places in that area to the Secretary of State; secondly, to react to the Secretary of State's direction to produce rationalisation proposals against specific criteria for GM schools of that area; thirdly, to secure sufficient suitable GM school places; fourthly, to ensure that every child of compulsory school age in GM schools is being suitably educated; fifthly, to propose closure of, enlargement of or significant changes to the character of existing GM schools; sixthly, to direct a GM school to increase its capacity—up to the level at which a statutory proposal for a significant enlargement would be required—and have a duty to meet capital costs of such change; seventhly, to be able to propose the opening of new grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew MacKay 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berkshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many of these are there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to listen carefully to find out. That is the first time that he has spoken—I thought that he was on strings, to be honest. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
shall continue: eighthly, to discharge concurrently with the LEA the duty to have regard to the need for securing special educational provision and to ensure the maintenance of necessary places for pupr j 1–9ils with statements in schools in the area; ninthly, to have the power to propose the establishment of a GM special school; tenthly, to have the power to enlarge or to change the character of a GM school to provide for pupils with special education needs in consultation with the LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacKay</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that what it says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does say that. At least I am on my feet, saying something. The hon. Gentleman has sat there like a puppet and said nothing, apart from one remark, which I shall mention later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he told us he would speak to amendment No. 32, which relates to the establishment of
	<br><q><p>"not less than seven regional committees".</p></q>
I hope that he will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to show that the powers of the funding agency will directly affect local people and that it will take decisions that should be taken only if it is familiar with the conditions of that particular area. Those powers should be with local people. It is no good an organisation in London, Manchester or wherever it is decided that it should be taking local decisions. The powers should be exercised only by those with local expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one more category, so I hope that the Committee will bear with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When 75 per cent. of pupil numbers for a sector in an LEA are in grant-maintained schools, the duty to ensure sufficient school places passes to the funding agency alone and the LEA no longer has a strategic role to play in the provision of schools in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every one of the powers must be carried out with the intimate knowledge of the local area. There is no point an agency or quango outside the regions trying to put the regulations into being if they have no knowledge of the local area. The powers and responsibilities demonstrate the need for detailed local knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers set out in the first three lines of the schedule are even wider. It states that
	<br><q><p>"a funding authority may do anything which appears to them to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of or in connection with the discharge of their functions".</p></q>
Those responsibilities can be exercised effectively only by local people who know their area and have an intimate knowledge of it, not by a central, national body. When the Minister winds up the debate, will he tell us whether the Government's intention is that there will be only one central organisation or will they set up regional organisations? The Minister has been helpful until now and I am sure that he will answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear precedent for regional structures being laid upon a national body. Even the Government Departments are spread across the country and throughout the regions. For example, in the north, based in Newcastle, are the regional offices of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport. There are many other examples of power being devolved to the regions. Other examples are the Health and Safety Executive, the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and the regional structures of further and higher
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
education regional structures. Perhaps the most comparable are the regional health authorities. They decentralise to district organisations: small units that know their areas. If that is good enough for the health service, it must be good enough for the education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even though such organisations are made up of Tories and closet Tories, at least they are local organisations and they know the areas which they serve. When those organisations were set up, it was recognised that they required local knowledge and that it was necessary to devolve responsibilities to local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill recognises the need for committees, but schedule 1(8) does not set out at what level. A minimum level can be predicted and the amendment addresses that need, so it strengthens the Bill. We would expect the Government to accept an amendment that strengthens this dreadful Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving his arguments for more regional committees and committee structures, but does he accept that the most important consequence of the Bill is to improve the education of our young people and to get more resources into education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his proposal will absorb valuable resources into extra bureaucracy and extra expenses? It is counterproductive from the point of view of the education of our young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point; he is probably correct. I want the best educational system for children attending state schools. The Bill will not achieve that. It represents political dogma. The Government dislike local education authorities and they hate local government and want to disband it. They are wasting money by establishing a funding agency. The money would be far better spent on the education service. If the Government want a funding agency, they will have to spend more money to ensure that it works properly. It is no good spending a small amount of money on a funding agency that cannot do the job properly. I agree with the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Thompson) that the introduction of a funding agency is a scandalous waste of money. If it has to be funded, it should be devolved to the regions so that it works properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A major criticism of the Bill is the lack of democratic accountability. I have said that time and again and I shall go on saying it, as will my hon. Friends and the majority of people who take an interest in education. If the Government want to give at least some semblance of a recognition of local views, it is important to move to an acceptable regional structure, rather than avoid local operations, by giving the funding authority the option of whether to set up committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have shown their hostility towards LEAs. Apart from his second intervention, the Government Whip's only other contribution to the debate was when he said from a sedentary position—it might have been a joke, but if so, it was in very bad taste, or it might have been accurate information—that the Government would abolish county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether in Wales or in England, the hon. Gentleman said that the Government would abolish county councils. I cannot believe that they would abolish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
county councils in Wales without doing so in England. Local councils are destined to go as part of a vindictive campaign against accountable local authorities, because they do not vote Conservative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if Conservative Members support the demise of local education authorities, they are here to stay. Local education authorities will remain regardless of local authority units. In Durham, grant-maintained schools have been rejected. I am confident that that position will continue, although the odd school may seek grant-maintained status. That is inevitable. Under the local education authority's strategic planning, schools may have to close. Despite what the Minister of State at the Welsh Office said, the Government will not allow schools that seek grant-maintained status to close. In many areas, perhaps even in Durham, the funding agency will have to work with the local education authority. That will not be accomplished easily if the funding agency is centralised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task would not be tackled successfully by delegation to lone officers in different areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 would provide a framework that would enable the funding agency's work with local authorities to be carried out successfully. It would ensure that a mechanism existed to provide for vital local knowledge, which would enable informed decisions to be made about local education issues. Any decisions about education should be taken with due regard to local circumstances and views. That can be achieved only by an agency that knows an area, is based there and is sensitive to local needs and issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The schools in my constituency have been very successful and parents have not opted for grant-maintained status. My children went to the comprehensive school in the catchment area where they live. My daughter is taking a law degree at Nottingham university and my son has applied to go to Cambridge university next year. The state system has not failed them, and I had a choice of schools to which to send them. I am happy with the state system, as are most parents in my constituency. A lot of nonsense is talked about grant-maintained schools. I agree that the standard of education depends on the teachers and the school. In Durham, both are excellent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to realise that grant-maintained schools are still within the state system.

is to educate children, not to promote or deny the role of education authorities. The hon. Gentleman should realise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The education of children has nothing to do with the Bill.

The headmaster of Baverstock school says that the number of his first-choice applications has risen from 25 a year when he was under the local education authority to 400 last year and 500 this year, but that the educational ability of the pupils coming to his school has dropped, even though he is getting better results.

The Bill has nothing to do with education because it is dogmatic and politically motivated.

It is clear that local representation is needed in both local and national structures. Logically, the people with the necessary local knowledge are local education authority representatives. They have experience and knowledge of education provision in their areas. Their contribution would be invaluable, regardless of whether they belong to the Labour party or the Conservative party. Those representatives have been democratically elected within the local authority, they know their regions and they would have a role to play if regional committees were to be set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional committees would give the funding agency some democratic respectability at national and local level. The Further and Higher Education Act 1992 was also used to undermine local authorities. It has forced further education into the free market and turned it into a rat race, but it made clear the need for a regional structure. All we ask is that the funding agency should have a regional structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the Bill: does he know that it is entitled "Education Bill"? Has he read the explanatory and financial memorandum? If so, will he reject the comments of the hon. Member for City of Durham who is chairman of the Opposition's parliamentary committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is in order, I shall respond to that intervention. I have read the Bill. If the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham gave a telling description of the Bill. The Bill deals mainly with establishing a grant-maintained system of schools and a funding agency. We are now considering an amendment that would set up a regional structure for that agency. My hon. Friend said that the Bill was a bad measure that would contribute little to improving the education of the majority of people. If we must accept a funding agency, a regional structure would bring some of its functions closer to people who live beyond London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In part III, the Government have attempted to improve the provision for children who have statements. But, on the whole, the Bill does not attempt to ensure the provision of more resources, or a better education system. It would set up an alternative system of funded schools, which are unnecessary to provide quality education, and choice for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 would establish
	<br><q><p>"not less than seven regional"</p></q>
bodies to provide effective local administration for the funding agency or council. That could be difficult. Earlier in our proceedings, I believe that the Minister mentioned the possibility of a regional structure. However, he pointed out that the rate at which schools in local education authorities were becoming grant-maintained varied widely across the country. That could have implications for the introduction of a regional structure. For example, when the Further Education Funding Council was set up, everybody knew the location of the colleges, so it was relatively easy to decide that there should be a regional structure to take account of the regional needs of those colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we have a much more difficult and complex picture in the Bill. It could be argued that England could manage for many years with a national funding council and perhaps a regional set-up in one or two areas, and that the rate of the move to grant-maintained status would not bring enough schools into the system to justify setting up a local or regional committee. Nevertheless, there should be provision in the Bill to take account of the introduction of a regional committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, we debated the Welsh funding council, which would be established when the Secretary of State decided that the time was right, and without reference to the number of schools for which such an establishment might be appropriate. In the Welsh context, I must confess that I should be surprised if, in my own lifetime, the need arose to set up a funding council, let alone regional bodies. But we must take such possibilities, however unlikely, into account. By suggesting that there should be not fewer than seven such regional bodies, we would neatly take account of the existing county structure in Wales. We have left the amendment flexible because there could be arguments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
about whether, for example, there should be three funding bodies for the three Glamorgan counties or whether there should be a return to the basis of old local government reorganisation, when it was originally intended to have two new counties out of the old Glamorgan—although, as we know, things did not work out that way and we have three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the funding council were to be established and if, in the 22nd or 23rd centuries, there was a need to have a regional structure because, by that time, there were enough grant-maintained schools to justify it, at least the bodies would be nearer to the people who would have to use that service than an office in Cardiff attempting to serve the whole of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would have more severe problems with the regional set-up of the funding agency in England. We propose that there should be not fewer than seven regional committees to put down a marker to the effect that, if there are many grant-maintained schools, we believe that powers should be devolved down from the national funding agency to local level, where people can be appointed to ensure that the local needs are properly represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 115 contains a specific and helpful provision to ensure that if, at any time the Secretary of State for Education considers it appropriate to establish a regional structure, he will find help in the Bill to guide him, so that the appointed people will be from the region for which the Committee is to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem self-evident that a regional committee should include people representing that region but the Government have appointed people to the Mid Glamorgan health authority who do not live in that area. There is a certain wisdom in requiring a specified membership on regional committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to know the Minister's thinking on this matter. I realise that there may be difficulties in establishing the committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Byers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallsend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the difficulties is that we do not know where the funding agency will be situated? It is the Government's policy to decentralise various functions of government to areas outside London—most of us welcome that. If the agency were located outside London that might make a significant difference. It may be located in a fairly remote part of England—perhaps in the area of my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or in Wallsend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would welcome it in Wallsend. If it were in Durham that would make it even more remote to my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) and others in the south-west. It would be useful if the Government could tell us where the funding agency might be established. The more remote it is, the stronger the argument for regional committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The location of the national office of the English agency and the Welsh council would be important if we were to set up a regional structure. The office in Wales might be in Cardiff, but there is a strong case for locating it in a town such as Brecon; that happens to be my home town, and being centrally located it would be an excellent choice. It would not be quite equidistant from people living on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
edges of Wales, but it would make the journey a little easier than having to travel the length of Wales. I do that frequently: it takes four or five hours to travel from my home in Cefn Cribwr near Bridgend up to Llandudno or Llangefni and all points north.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the term "subsidiarity" may be relevant to this matter? As I understand it, it means devolving power to the lowest possible level at which it can be effective. The Prime Minister interpreted "subsidiarity" in the European context to mean devolution to central Government rather than to local government. In this instance, we are talking of a funding agency, not of the schools funding themselves, so the term "subsidiarity" has some importance. Could we not devolve to a lower level—to a regional funding committee—rather than to a central funding agency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. When subsidiary is enshrined in the treaty of Maastricht with a specific definition—and if the European Communities (Amendment) Bill is enacted in this House and the Danes resolve their referendum problem—parents could petition the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg for the establishment of a regional organisation for funding agencies on the ground that, under the subsidiarity rule, that is part of a logical process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that parents would have no such need because the entire thrust, content and philosophy of the present Bill is that parents be given greater decision-making power at school level through their boards of governors? The very essence of subsidiarity is fully met by the Bill and could, arguably, be denied by the formalised regional bureaucracy that Opposition Members advocate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could, perhaps, respond to the Minister within the context of the amendment's proposal to establish a regional framework for funding authorities. But we are talking of two completely different issues. On the funding agency, we are discussing a regional set-up for a body that will have responsibility for handing down funds to individual schools which have at some point chosen grant-maintained status. At some stage, the funding agency, in conjunction with the local education authority, will have power to become involved in the policy of providing places in schools. Furthermore, it is possible that the funding agency in England and the funding council in Wales will become entirely responsible for school places provision policy. If that happened, each school that had become grant maintained and had a board of governors running its internal affairs could find itself mightily affected by the funding agency's decisions because that agency will be responsible for passing on funds to the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Maastricht treaty became law in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a school that felt especially aggrieved about the way in which a national funding agency had handled the funds made available to it could have a case for saying that subsidiarity was not being properly respected on the basis that a regional structure, if it existed, would have been much closer to schools that were unhappy with the way in which money was being disbursed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the regional context, there is a problem: if the funding agency in England takes over complete
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
responsibility for providing sufficient places in schools because the 75 per cent. cut-off mark was being reached, it will also then have responsibility for rationalising places in a given area. The agency will then be faced with having to close schools, because that decision, too, will be its responsibility. When threatened with closure, those schools will apply to opt out. If granted opt-out, they will then be directly funded by the agency. Is not that another reason why this form of devolution is needed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an interesting example. No doubt the Minister will think about it and reply later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that a regional structure will be needed at some stage. The process may be lopsided: we shall probably find that, in decade or so, one or two regions in England will require a regional organisation to manage their schools, whereas, for Wales, a century or two will pass before the provisions are required. Important points need an answer from the Minister, given that he has said that the Government would consider establishing a regional structure. Can he respond in the next couple of hours? He may need more time to explain at length how he sees the system developing and to tell us whether a regional structure for grant-maintained schools is appropriate to take us into the next millenium, which is when all this might happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The organisation of the funding agency is an issue of great significance. I start from the premise that the education needs of Wallsend and Worcester differ. I hope that an education system would reflect differing needs and aspirations. If we moved to a system of central control of education, many of the initiatives made over the years which have benefited education in general would not continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the decisions that have taken education forward—comprehensive schools, nursery provision and others—were provided by local needs and wishes rather than simply imposed from the centre. Often, the Government, for whatever reason, failed to regard them as meriting priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One drawback and danger of a central funding agency is that we shall lose the diversity of provision. After all, the White Paper was entitled "Choice and Diversity". A regional structure along the lines proposed in the amendments would make the agency more acceptable and more responsive to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed giving power to individual schools. The interesting aspect of the Bill is the great powers that it will give to the funding agency and to the Secretary of State. Therefore, we need to ensure that the funding agency is aware of what happens locally. Clause 56 gives the Secretary of State power
	<br><q><p>"to replace all or any of the first governors"</p></q>
of a grant-maintained school. That is hardly taking power from the centre, or even from the local authority, and giving it to individual schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 97 provides for the Secretary of State to give notice to a grant-maintained school of his intention to withdraw a grant. That is hardly decentralisation. The Bill gives the Secretary of State 44 separate powers which he was proud to boast about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Less than a year ago, the Government set up, through the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the Funding Council for Further Education. That body has a regional
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
structure. There is powerful argument for the establishment of a similar regional structure in this case. If it was good enough less than a year ago for the Further Education Funding Council, surely it is good enough here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I am extremely worried about the way in which Conservative Members define local interest. It has been asserted that parent power is the key to local interest, as if people are parents only at a specific time and in connection with a specific activity. It implies that their role does not encompass other facets of citizenship. I deeply oppose that view. I am horrified at the idea of putting people into compartments in that way. It is a classic, centralist definition—[HON. MEMBERS: "It's called socialism."] It is not in the slightest bit socialist. It is the definition established in schedule 1(8)(1) which states:
	<br><q><p>"A funding authority may establish a committee for any purpose"—</p></q>
any purpose that is decided by the Secretary of State. That is too great a power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 1(8)(1) says—and I will be quoting it extensively when I reply to the debate—that
	<br><q><p>"A funding authority may establish a committee for any purpose."</p></q>
It does not mention the Secretary of State. I know that the hon. Gentleman is good at considering the meaning of the words, and I hope that he will do so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly correct. I took it that the funding authorities were responsible to the Secretary of State and that only he could stop funding authorities from setting up gaming houses to get their money for schools. That is an absurdity. I understand that the hon. Member for Battersea spoke about the grammar of the amendment while I was absent from the Room having dinner with my wife and daughter. That is extraordinary. We used an elisory pronomial phrase which allows us to use the word "less". As the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, the Government did not use an elisory phrase in clauses 1 and 2, but used the word "less" directly with a noun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not the main thrust of my argument. I understand what clauses 1 and 2 mean, despite the loose phraseology, and I understand what schedule 1(8)(1) means. What I cannot understand is the way in which Conservative Members do not perceive that they are creating a monster which will contribute nothing towards the education of our children and our children's children. As a parent, I am not interested only in the education of people in my area. Of course I am interested in the education of my four children. I was delighted with the very varying results that they achieved in their very good comprehensive school, at which I used to teach before they began as pupils. I am also interested in what happens to my grandchildren and their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment would get it into the community, at least. A free-standing school is nothing if it is not part of the community out of which it has grown.

The shadowy centralised body will be effected if 10 per cent. of schools become grant maintained. I doubt whether that will happen in Wakefield metropolitan district, but it could happen elsewhere. When one in 10 pupils attends a grant-maintained school, the shadowy centralised body will come into effect. With apologies to my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham, I do not care where the body is based; even if it is based in Hemsworth, to replace some of the jobs that have been taken away, it will be remote from schools. It will not be able to co-operate properly with local authorities to provide the comprehensive education that is needed. It will not be able to judge; it will be too far from the people. It needs a regional tier to take account of the susceptibilities of local people. It will not do to make changes in five years' time, because for some children that is a lifetime in school. The Government are to risk the career of many children without even testing the grant-maintained system. On the ground a funding authority can at least be monitored and will be more effective than if it is based at the centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A centralised body will not be able to monitor another favourite theme of the Bill—religious education, which is dear to my heart. How will a centralised body help those grant-maintained schools that already find it difficult to provide teachers in religious education? Religious education has been nurtured by local education authorities. It would not exist in many LEA areas without the dedication of advisers who have provided assistance to teachers who have not been properly trained in the subject. The hon. Member for Erewash moans her disagreement from a sedentary position. Who has helped with religious education in her constituency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a number of years, I was a member of an education committee whose chairman was an agnostic and did not support any form of religious education. The education authority was run by the Labour party, which did not promote religious education in schools. Promoters of religious education have been the Education Reform Act 1988, local churches and parents. The Bill builds on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going rather wide. I hope that we can relate religious education to the regional committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bodies for which the Bill provides will be more remote than the local authorities. Local authorities, including Sheffield, have done much to assist the religious education of our children. Regional bodies would be closer to the people and more involved in religious education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the education authority in the Sheffield diocese reasonably well. When it was part of the Leeds diocese I was on the Catholic education council. The chief education officer in Sheffield is a Catholic and she sends her child to a Catholic school. The hon. Lady argued that the funding authorities would be better able to assist in religious education than local authorities. We want a local funding authority rather than a national authority.

There is a lot of hypocrisy on the Conservative Benches. We need sensitivity: someone who can assist schools when they are in difficulties. We do want not someone who takes over and closes down the school, but someone who is able to spot the problems before they occur and do something about them. Our proposal will make that easier, although not as easy as under the LEAs, which have been a great success under parties of both political complexions.

My plea is: do not wreck the chances of our children and our children's children with this heedless Bill; and approach the matter from the roots upwards instead of from the top downwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intrigued—I could almost say that I have been dragged to my feet—by the Minister's comments about formalised regionalised bureaucracies. I regard that as an unprovoked attack on the Secretary of State by the Under-Secretary. The Secretary of State dealth with this matter in paragraph 3.10 of the White Paper—I assume these are the Secretary of State's own words as he wrote it himself one weekend. He said:
	<br><q><p>"The Funding Agency will be able, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, to set up regional offices as the number of GM schools grows, to carry out its closely prescribed duties."</p></q>
The Minister may think that such committees would be formalised regionalised bureaucracies, but that was not the view of the Secretary of State. We need clarification. Who speaks for the Government on this issue? In the absence of the Secretary of State, we have his representative, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: His representative on earth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not go so far as to say that the hon. Gentleman represents him "on the other side". Perhaps he could clarify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend gave the game away. I am glad that the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education is present. The Further Education Funding Council set up regional subcommittees. I assume that the unprovoked attack on the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education by the Under-Secretary of State for Schools signifies some tetchiness and another right-left split among those on the Government Front Bench. It is incumbent on both Ministers to respond to the debate because there is clearly a difference of opinion. Were we to proceed to a vote, the Government would be in the embarrassing position of having two Ministers voting on different sides. It would be helpful if the Ministers debated the issue in front of a tolerant and reasonable audience. The further education branch of the Ministry is clearly set out in numerous documents, all of which I am happy to read should there be any doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a note by the then Department of Education and Science about the Further Education Funding Council for England regional committees. It said that the White Paper, "Education and Training for the 21st Century"—admittedly written by a previous Secretary of State for Education and Science—announced the Government's intention that the Further Education Funding Council for England should have regional advisory committees appointed by the Secretary of State. It stated that their role would be to advise the Further

Education Funding Council on local issues related to its powers and duties, and on local factors that affect funding requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The note did not mention formalised, regionalised bureaurocracies; that phraseology has been introduced since March or April of this year—just before or after the general election. The post-election Government are moving away from regionalisation. The Minister must clarify why further education, with arguably fewer institutions, needs regionalised committees, yet the funding agency of schools does not need such committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Like me, Sir John, you come from a far-flung part of the country: your constituency is far-flung just down the road and mine is far-flung in the north of England. Even those members of the Government who represent parts of the country outside the orbit of the M25 sometimes feel that Whitehall is a long way away from their constituents. That is not a knee-jerk into my customary view of the south of England—we are all national politicians in the House. Most hon. Members who represent most regions, including the south-east, think that Whitehall can be an incredibly long way from their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point was recognised in further education, when it was accepted that local issues had importance and needed to be incorporated through regional committees. Some of the duties of the regional committees of the Further Education Funding Council involve various duties. The Department note states that they include
	<br><q><p>"The need for close liaison between the Council's regional offices and the LEAs … the need for the regional offices to work closely with TECs and with Department of Employment regional offices and … the need to ensure ease of access between the regional office and all parts of the region."</p></q>
The funding agency for schools will have responsibility for aspects of schooling from the beginning to, in some cases, post-16 education. All the reasons that were put forward to support the Further Education Funding Council—the need for liaison with the TECs and the LEAs at a local level—will be as important for the funding agencies for schools.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. The Committee was not quorate at the appointed time.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. Will you give a clear ruling on the motion moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled that I cannot accept a motion for the Adjournment at this stage of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. It will not have escaped your notice, although it seems to have escaped the notice of Conservative Members, that the Committee was due to resume its sitting at 10.15 pm. Opposition members of the Committee were in their places at that time. With one or two notable exceptions, the Government Benches were empty. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who interrupted from a sedentary position, was not within the Committee's confines at that time. It was a gross discourtesy to you, Sir John, especially on the part of Ministers—particularly the Minister who was to reply to the debate. It placed Opposition Members, who were eager to proceed, in a difficult position: the Committee could not continue in the absence of Government Members because it was not quorate and because Ministers were not present. I ask you to use your discretion in talking to Ministers about that gross discourtesy. The least that the Minister can do is to apologise to everyone on the Committee and to you, Sir John.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I apologise unreservedly to the Committee, to the hon. Lady and to you, Sir John. Would you please clarify an important matter? I went to vote with the rest of the Committee. It was right that I should wait downstairs to see if there would be another Division. When I was satisfied that there would be no second Division, I came straight back to the Committee Room. If that was wrong, I hope for your guidance, Sir John. You must understand that Government Members expect to vote when there are Divisions; other hon. Members may take a different view. If it is your wish that we should return to the Committee Room and, if there is a further Division, go back downstairs again, I shall accept your guidance. Any discourtesy to the Committee will, I hope, be explained by what I have just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I recall that the first time that there was a Division in the House during an evening sitting of the Committee you made it clear that the suspension of our proceedings would be for 15 minutes for each Division. You reminded us of that before we left the Committee Room at 10 pm when the Bell rang for a Division in the House. There is therefore no reason why hon. Members could not be back in the Committee by 10.15 pm. Had a subsequent Division been called, we would have had sufficient time in the eight minutes that are alloted for that purpose to go downstairs again. It is a bit rich of the Minister to pretend that he was not aware of what was going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. With respect, it was not possible for us to vote on the Opposition proposal because points of order were being made, not least by me. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea also intended to raise a further point of order. There was no question of a vote being taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have ascertained that a motion for the Adjournment of the Committee cannot be accepted while an hon. Member is on his feet addressing the Committee. The hon. Member for Stretford was addressing the Committee when the Division was called. On those grounds alone, I was in order in refusing the motion for the Adjournment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be sensible to allow a little flexibility when Divisions are called in the House. I mentioned a period of 15 minutes. Clearly, it was difficult for some hon. Members to return to the Committee within the prescribed period. As Chairman, I, too, should be allowed some flexibility in such circumstances. Alternatively, we should always allow half an hour for a Division. Some hon. Members might consider that to be excessive. We should be more sensible about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. The Opposition feel that the ruling was somewhat partisan. I accept that that was not your intention, Sir John, and I do not wish to impute partisan motives to you, but the impact of the ruling favoured the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Government Whip are determined to drive Conservative Members hard. Conservative Members are flagging already, which explains their lack of contributions. When the Division Bells rang, I was on my feet. Had I not been here when our proceedings were resumed, I would not have expected you to wait for me, Sir John. It is not a reasonable request to make of any Chairman. If we are to have flexibility, can it be negotiated with both Whips in future? Otherwise, it leads to the conclusion that such a ruling protects the Government. If it had not been made, the Committee would have been adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's point to the extent that flexibility should be exercised for both sides of the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman had not been in his place at 10.15 pm, I would have deferred the start of our proceedings for about two or three minutes to allow him to return to the Committee. I try to be impartial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. I understand your motives for waiting for a few minutes to allow Conservative Members and their Whip to get organised. However, recently, on the Floor of the House, when a Conservative Whip moved that the House be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
adjourned, the Speaker had no option but to implement the procedures initiated by the Whip. As soon as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford moved that the Committee be adjourned, you should have agreed to the motion, Sir John. The Opposition have no complaints about your chairmanship, Sir John, but, with all due respect, I have taken advice from elsewhere—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ooh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. If the Minister took advice, he would be better organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken advice, and if such a ruling is given again, we shall take the matter to Madam Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ooh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must object to the "oohs" and "ahs" emitted by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion for the Adjournment of our proceedings should have been accepted. I reserve the right to take the matter up with Madam Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must do as he sees fit. The motion to adjourn can be allowed only at the discretion of the Chairman. It cannot be moved while an hon. Member is addressing the Committee. The hon. Member for Stretford was speaking when proceedings were suspended for the Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what you have said, Sir John. I have asked the Clerk about the precedent on which you based your rejection of the motion moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford. I am still waiting for an answer, Sir John. With respect, I hope that you or the Clerk will give me the precedent for your decision to reject the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Rutherglen (Mr. McAvoy) was not in the Room when I raised the matter originally, but it would have been extremely difficult for you to have discussed the matter or allowed a Vote on the motion when you were dealing with points of order. You could not have allowed the Committee to proceed to a Division until those points of order had been dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. The hon. Member for Rutherglen is buried in a book at the moment but he was not in the Room to hear your explanation. I hope that, when he reads the 	<i>Official Report</i> of your ruling, he will understand it. The hon. Member for Stretford was on his feet when the Division was called downstairs and the Committee was suspended. When we came back, he stood up to continue his speech, but he did not move that the Question be now put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he moved that the Committee be adjourned until Thursday morning. Your ruling, Sir John, appears to be absolutely correct in terms of the procedure that would be accepted downstairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. A number of matters are relevant to your consideration. First, points of order were not raised until after you had ruled that the motion for Adjournment was not in order. Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford, who moved the Adjournment, had previously been addressing

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
the Committee. There is a strong argument that, by implication, my hon. Friend would have finished his speech and would therefore would have been in a position to move that the Committee be adjourned. I should be interested if you would tell me, Sir John, what the precedent is when the hon. Gentleman addressing the Committee is the one who moves the Adjournment of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to provide such precedents at a moment's notice. That research can be carried out, and the hon. Gentleman may wish to pursue his inquiries in that way. However, "Erskine May" makes it clear that any motion to adjourn the Committee is accepted only at the Chairman's discretion. The Chairman's power is complete in that respect. Hon. Members have the right to question my decision, but the decision is mine to make, at my discretion, and I so ruled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in the interesting position of having to carry on speaking to protect the integrity of the Chair. It is a measure of the confidence that Opposition Members have in your chairmanship, Sir John, that I shall now return to the amendments under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appropriate thing for me to say next to the hon. Member for Norwich, North is "or Darlington", as I was caught in mid-sentence when—[HON. MEMBERS: "Ah!"] Would you explain, Sir John, to Conservative Members that it is common for hon. Members to be forced to continue a speech in mid-sentence if they are speaking in the Chamber when the 10 o'clock business motion is moved? That is far from unique, and if Conservative Members had a little more experience of the real workings of the House they may have been able to appreciate that. If I may, I shall continue my—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Excellent speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have that commendation from the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth placed on the record. The point that I was making to the hon. Member for Norwich, North is simple. It is that many people in the north of England consider Norwich to be in the heart of the deep south. However, I know the people of Norwich regard association with London and the home counties as an anathema. As to regional flexibility and the need to advise on local issues and factors that affect funding and, by extension, the planning of school places, the Department of Education has stated that regional sensitivity makes a great deal of sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the practical aspect, the Minister talked about formalised regionalised bureaucracies. But he will in any case have to create a bureaucracy that will deal with regionally differentiated issues. Even if everything is done within the confines of central London, it is impossible to believe that no specific individuals will be appointed to handle regional factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing whether regional flavour is being built into the system—a concept that the Department for Education accepted in relation to further education. Will local factors genuinely influence the funding agency's decision making or will it merely be a matter of lip service being paid to the regional point of view but no consideration given to it? The Minister promised a short while ago that he would try to respond to the debate. Hon. Members who represent constituencies outside the south-east of England await with interest the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
Gentleman's answers on how that role will be performed—assuming, of course, that he does not accept our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth recapping on why we are considering the Bill. It is because we need to create the financial framework within which grant-maintained schools will operate. Even though the schools have met with overwhelming indifference from the vast majority of parents, the Bill provides for a funding agency for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members who chose not to make speeches, but interrupted the speeches of others, told us that the Bill would give greater democratic rights and powerts to parents. We were also told that there will be no guarantees in respect of a regional structure for the funding agency although the Minister whispered from a sedentary position—I read his lips—that the agency could be situated in Darlington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) told the Committee about the role of local education authorities in the leadership of local people. He spoke of how innovation had come about because of LEAs, and listed ways in which a local body can react to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell of another area of local need that has been filled in many areas: it is community education. In Cambridgeshire, Leicestershire and my own county of Devon, local bodies doing local things for local people at the wish of parents and voters have created community education in their areas. I shall come back to that as a pointer to the way in which parents can exercise under LEAs rights that would be denied them if the funding agency were in Darlington, or somewhere else locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential role of the Bill—this must be emphasised time and again—is to take away the rights of parents acting in the interests of their children. It removes from them the fundamental right to go out, as they will next May, to vote for their local council to run the LEA for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee may be interested to learn that, in the past hour, the result has been announced of the first ballot on grant-maintained status at a school in my constituency. Two thirds of the parents were in favour—a majority of 288. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that that is an example of parents exercising their right to choose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady might be interested in what happened in my part of the country, a bit further up the coast. She may wish to take back to parents my message about a very successful school, run by a local education authority, that was truly a beacon of excellence under that authority. I refer to Woodroffe school in Dorset. As the hon. Lady is holding a pen, perhaps she will take a few notes to help her to explain to parents why this school, which obtained excellent examination results, was extremely popular with local parents and enjoyed a good relationship with its local authority, has had to sack seven teachers. Will she explain to them why its financial arrangements are in a mess, with the head teacher and senior staff suspended and parents meeting in large groups to protest about these events? A parent asked me whether there was some device by which the parents could use their voting power to vote to return to local authority control. Let the hon. Lady tell the tale of the disaster of a year's

experience of opting out at Woodroffe school. That little beacon of excellence now shines as brightly as a Toc H lamp.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that what the hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) told us confirms what an even-handed LEA Derbyshire must be because, given the result that she mentioned, there must have been no intimidation in that parents' ballot?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also interesting that in a reply to a parliamentary question which I received yesterday, the Minister had to accept that no formal complaint had been received by his Department from any parent in the land about opting-out ballots. That, not the fiction put out by Conservative Members, is the true position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing that point to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the hon. Member for Erewash interrupted me, I was saying that the vital power that is being taken from parents is the right to elect local councillors. More importantly, parents have the right to remove them if they do not want them. Perhaps the hon. Lady, in one of her interjections—or the Minister—will explain what power parents will have to remove one person from the funding agency. They will have no power over the agency because the dead, clammy hand of a quango will take over. Let us hear no more from Conservative Members about powers for parents because they are taking powers from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman at least concede that when people vote in local government elections, they vote for a wide variety of issues and that, regrettably, education is one of the least important reasons for their voting? His arguments about a democratic link are utterly spurious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where the hon. Gentleman has been. I remember that during a period of Tory control in Leicestershire about 12 years ago, community education was under threat in that authority. It was eventually taken over by a vast assortment of Labour, SDP and Independent councillors because local people voted strongly on education matters. Let us not hear from Conservative Members that people do not vote on education issues. Education authorities spend 75 to 80 per cent. of total council tax. That makes people feel accountable. They will have no accountability through the funding agency because, even though the money will be raised locally, it will be spent nationally on their behalf by this unelected, unaccountable body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the democracy argument, will he confirm that there was a great swing to Labour in the 1981 county council elections precisely because of its education policy? Even local authorities such as Cheshire, which was Conservative controlled until 1981, went Labour as a result of the education issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing that to our attention.

With whom do parents communicate if there is a funding agency? To whom do they talk if there is a difficulty, or if they want changes in the local education system, if the funding agency has taken over responsibility? Do they go to their local councillor or knock on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
door of county hall? Do they go to the education chairperson—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Conservative Members are not used to the gender-free language of Tory Devon. If it will help them, I will say the "chair" of the education committee. Do parents go to those bodies or do they get on a little train or bus or in a car and toddle up to Darlington to see whether the quango is meeting and they can have a chat and put their local point of view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would have to travel a long way to Darlington, which is in Durham county, where not one school has opted out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's interjection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion, I shall accept that parents may want to talk to the local authority, to the funding agency or to any other committee or body that is being debated. But will the hon. Gentleman concede what is believed by parents up and down the country, whose main concern—even though they may have a wider interest in education as a whole—is the education of their own children? As hon. Members who have taught in schools will agree, parents' worries about their children's education should be raised with the teachers, the head teacher or the governors of the school. Opposition Members underestimate the importance of that approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that I would agree with the hon. Gentleman so earnestly. He is right that parents are interested in the education of their own children, but that is inseparable from the actions of the local education authority in terms of school provision. The level of funding locally is determined by the LEA. Parents can vote in a local election for the councillors who will determine the amount of money that is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Erewash may tell the parents of children at the school in the hon. Lady's constituency that has just opted out what will happen, and to whom the parents will go, if the funding agency decides that it will close that school. Will the parents have to go trotting off to Darlington in the hope that the quango is meeting or could they go to their local education authority? It is essential that the rights of parents to go to their LEA should not be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that they will almost certainly go to the Secretary of State, as they do at present, if their school is to be closed by the LEA and it is insensitive to local opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost hesitate to speak, lest we should find ourselves in the same situation as we were in a moment ago. I am glad that we have woken up some Conservative Members and now have had a reply from the Minister. What he said is correct up to a point but the first port of call for parents is, of course, with their local councillor and the LEA. It is only when a matter reaches a crisis that parents approach the Minister. Conservative Members may take note of the fact that from now on, without the education authority to act as a buffer, many parents will raise issues directly with their Members of Parliament. Their mailbags will be full of complaints about grant-maintained schools and underfunding by the funding agency because there will be no regional body to which complaints can be referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are considering responsiveness to local needs and Conservative Members' feelings about a local body, it

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
might be instructive if we paused to think about the events of the past few days. The Department for Education, acting as the central body, which the funding agency will be, has published the exam results of schools throughout the country. The funding agency may operate in that way without the benefit of regional or local bodies to do some of the work for them. That was an example of a centralised force at work, spending at least £1·4 million of taxpayers' money to produce a glossy document containing information that was already available in most areas. Those tables show the sensitivity and lightness of touch of an orangutan playing a Stradivarius. We were told that it was an information revolution. My goodness, there was a revolution throughout the country when those figures were produced, because the vast majority of them were wrong. Authority after authority found that the tables were wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I know that you would not allow any hon. Member intentionally or unintentionally to mislead the Committee. The hon. Gentleman said that the vast majority of the figures are incorrect, but everyone knows that the vast majority of them are correct. If the hon. Gentleman read the quality weekend press, he would see that they were in favour of tables.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's latter point is not a matter for me. His first point is a matter of argument between the two sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir John. Do you, and the Committee, agree that a larger number of results were wrong? For my area, the Government did not even get the categories of school right; every 16 to 18 school and every school for retarded children was incorrect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have a debate on the examination results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, although I would not like the comments of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth to go unnoticed. I challenge him to tell me one authority for which the figures were correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Tell me one authority for which they were 100 per cent. correct. We should give the hon. Gentleman a little time to find out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The overwhelming majority of those figures—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The overwhelming majority of the figures published in those tables is correct. Next year when we publish more information, such as truancy figures, they will be of even greater value to parents. We try to give parents facts, not gossip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled that we must not debate the examination results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to my point. Those figures were produced by an organisation that was unresponsive to local needs. It was not a local organisation. My constituency has seven secondary schools, four of which have complained to me that major aspects of their results were incorrect. No local body would have made that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
mistake. Whoever produced those figures made a more interesting mistake: in Devon a new school was created called the "community college". Its results have been published, but no one in Devon knows where it is. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us. Perhaps the funding agency has been invented without our knowledge, and has pre-empted its new role by creating a new school. It has even got some examination results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend excuse the Department for Education, its statisticians and Her Majesty's inspectorate of schools? I understand that private business produced the incorrect statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those figures prove categorically that we need a replacement for the role that local education authorities perform. Parents could then exercise their rights to seek local redress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee may be relieved to know that I shall not be diverted to discuss legal detail. I shall not ask the Opposition why their amendment stipulates seven regional committees. I shall not ask which regions the Opposition would choose. That would be an unnecessary diversion. However, if the amendment were accepted, many people would ask those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should address such questions to the Under-Secretary of State for Further and Higher Education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the Opposition's hang-up with the FEFC. If the hon. Member for Stretford had listened to the hon. Member for Bridgend, he would have an answer to the point that he belaboured at length. The hon. Member for Bridgend said that he recognised the difference between the FEFC, which was set up for a known number of institutions and an organisation that will cover the open and less predictable structure of a growing grant-maintained sector. The Opposition should talk among themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for acknowledging that the Government have a problem. The FEFC knew exactly where it was going. That does not preclude a regional structure for the funding authorities for schools. However, it will be more difficult for the Government to establish such a structure. The figure "seven" was a starting point. To arrive at seven will take a long time, given the pace at which grant-maintained education is getting off the runway, hopping like Louis Bleriot's plane, which eventually crossed the channel. I did not object to the amendment in principle. I sympathised with the Minister's problem of creating a regional structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we are. There is a difference, in principle and in practice, between setting up an institution to deal with a known quantity and a known distribution of bodies, and pre-empting unknown growth and development. That problem underlies the amendment. It also gives some clue to the mind of the Opposition, who are obsessed with structures that they wish to set up regardless of circumstances. The Opposition wish to establish unnecessary bureaucracies and organisations to which people can be appointed. The hon. Member for City of Durham gave the clue to the matter. He boasted that there were no grant-maintained schools in his LEA, but in almost the same breath he asked for a regional organisation in his area to deal with those non-existent grant-maintained
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
schools. It strikes me as perverse for Opposition Members to ask for a formalised regional structure to handle a national distribution of grant-maintained schools which is irregular at the moment and may become more so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Member for City of Durham first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that I boasted that there were no grant-maintained schools in Durham county. I am delighted about that and I hope that there never will be any. However, I do not remember saying that I wanted a regional structure in Durham county. If I did, I misled the Committee. The Minister must remember that my region contains more than Durham county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, the seven regions wanted by other Opposition Members will not include Durham. That will mean that there will be an enclave among the regions, from which Durham will be excluded. That is some progress at least. I give way to the hon. Member for Stretford, who must clear up the mess for his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. A quick look at the Bill shows that it gives the Secretary of State discretion to set up the funding authorities. That is clear in clause 1. That discretion applies both to England and Wales. However, there are only three opted-out schools in Wales, and yet a council will be established to look after them. All we ask is that a region such as the north-west of England should be put on a par with Wales. It is not to diminish the importance of Wales to note that the north-west of England is somewhat larger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it is getting late, but Opposition Members must try harder. The plain fact is that there will be about 500 grant-maintained schools in England by next April. That number will have grown by the time the Bill is enacted and receives the Royal Assent. Patently, there will have to be, and will be, a funding agency for schools, but it is rash to try to predict the regional distribution of those schools. Establishing a formal, rigid structure from the start, without knowing how many grant-maintained schools there will be in different parts of the country is irresponsible folly, yet that is what the amendment is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will clarify what he has just said. Does he mean that he would consider setting up a regional structure in an area if the number of grant-maintained schools there rises to the levels that he hopes for? If so, will he outline the criteria that he will use to decide when a regional structure is necessary? Or does he mean that under no circumstances will such a structure be necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should be more patient, but I shall answer her questions now to help her. Schedule 1(8)(1) states:
	<br><q><p>"A funding authority may establish a committee for any purpose".</p></q>
The funding agency for schools will decide when and if a committee is appropriate. It will determine whether a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
regional representation is appropriate. If the agency is situated in the midlands or north of England, as is entirely possible, it might decide that a representation in the south-east is appropriate if that area contains many grant-maintained schools. That decision will also depend on whether the 10-per cent. threshold has been reached in individual LEAs. If not, a representation by the agency would not be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All such variations must be taken into consideration. My objection to the amendment is that Opposition Members want to pre-empt and predict the future in a rather rigid way, whereas we want to leave the agency the flexibility to respond to the development of the grant-maintained sector in a sensible and practical way. That is much more responsible and a wiser and safer use of resources. If the Opposition were allowed to set up a regional structure, the expenditure of resource would be ahead of requirements—that is the mildest way that I can put it—which cannot be the right way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that we are simply trying to enable him to do that if it becomes possible? I am encouraged to note that he does not expect that schools will opt out in sufficient numbers to make more than one funding agency necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will only ever be one funding agency, which may choose to have regional representations. That is not in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of his own amendment, which says:
	<br><q><p>"shall establish not less than seven regional committees".</p></q>
That does not leave much scope for phasing or for discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the points that I was about to make. The other was that the schedule uses the word "may", which is a more flexible and sensible approach, leaving the matter to the discretion of the funding agency, rather than foisting on it from the outset an inflexible, bureaucratic and expensive structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. When the hon. Member for Hemsworth intervened, I was reminded that he had made an important point during his speech, which I followed closely. He said, I believe—I want to check this in 	<i>Hansard</i>—that we might need to re-examine the 1944 Act and possibly subsequent statutes on education. The 1944 Act and others assumed that education would be delivered exclusively by local education authorities. The hon. Gentleman pointed out, very perceptively, that that assumption might have to be reconsidered in the light of the provisions of the Bill. I shall reflect on that important point and return to it in Committee if I consider that it should be followed up. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for pointing it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the amendment is that it rests on the touching faith of the Opposition in the existing arrangements. I do not know what the experience of my hon. Friends has been, but mine is that parents and members of the public often express to me as a Member of Parliament their disappointment at the failure of their local education authority to respond to their needs. They complain that it has failed them in its representative duty. No matter how strongly members on both sides of the Committee may believe that local education authorities are the ultimate in representation and democracy, the reality is otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
One cannot demonstrate beyond peradventure that there is a need to move away from the existing structure of representation to the structure suggested by the Opposition. As I said to the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), parents will complain in frustration to the Secretary of State that, for example, their elected, accountable LEA wants to close their school, despite their objections. That is a fairly frequent occurrence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The situation is even worse than my hon. Friend describes. In every case in which parents have come to see me about problems with their local schools or their local education authority, they did not even know who their local county councillor was. That supports my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is also my experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the success of local management of schools prove my hon. Friend's point that local education authorities are often not responsive to parents? Before local management of schools, head teachers found local education authorities enormously unresponsive in adapting to their demands on matters such as school maintenance and repairs. When the schools were given the opportunity to take control of their own affairs—an opportunity that will be given by grant-maintained status—that was done to the advantage of both schools and teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. This is an important point, which can be taken with the other point that was raised. Where we can, we want to give the maximum power to parents at school level—through governors. We want an increasing number of decisions to be made at that level, where possible. It is happening to a remarkable degree up and down the country with the local management of schools. In my discussions with head teachers, staff and governors, I am struck by how much they welcome the fact that they can make more and more decisions at school level rather than decisions being taken, often remotely, at local education authority level. In some of our more widely dispersed authorities, there is a feeling of remoteness from the LEA. That is the case in my own county. At our end of the county, there is no great feeling of oneness with county hall, which is a considerable way away, as my hon. Friend and I know from experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members, particularly the hon. Member for Devonport, tried to make a point about the local production of information by my Department. I think that the hon. Gentleman's point was unfair and I should like to give the Committee the facts. We have recently produced comprehensive information on examination results, covering all the education authorities in the country. We have had 111 complaints out of 23,000 schools and 109 LEAs. We investigated 83, and found that there were indeed five errors—two were typographical and three were proper, substantive errors. Of the rest that we have looked at, at least half were errors generated by the schools themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to test your patience any further, Sir John, but I should like to finish this point. I shall give the Committee more up-to-date information as the picture develops. It is important that the Committee understands the position. Out of millions of pieces of data, that was the error rate. That is a remarkable tribute to everyone involved in producing the new information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there will be further complaints, which the Minister's Department will no doubt wish to investigate. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what investigation his Department made into the ability of PMS Communications Ltd. to carry out the exercise, and what previous expertise that organisation had in conducting an inquiry on this scale?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the performance of the organisation has been quite remarkable. When we take away input errors by schools, the error rate is negligible. We have every reason to be satisfied with the organisation's work. It was a complete vindication of our decision to give the job to the private sector rather than having it done by my Department or any other public body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's dogma triumphs over reason. He may be content with the result—many schools are not. I ask the Minister again to answer the question that I put to him: what investigations did his Department carry out into the ability and expertise of PMS Communications Ltd before awarding it the contract?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That cannot possibly be relevant to the amendment. I have allowed a fairly wide debate on this matter which, technically, was out of order in any case. I hope that we can now revert to debating the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have covered most of the points made by Opposition Members. This has been an important debate and it is important to clarify the exact position. There will be a funding agency for schools which will have the powers to establish regional presences or representations as it sees fit, to respond to the growth and development of the grant-maintained school sector. I believe that that will more than adequately meet the sector's requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand exactly what the Minister is saying. Is it the intention of the Secretary of State to issue any guidelines at all on the procedures of the funding agency in reference to that, or will it be left to its discretion, without any guidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would expect the Secretary of State to give guidance to the funding agency in many ways and to say that it will be free to make its decisions about regional or local presences—on a permanent or an ad hoc basis—as it thinks best to serve the grant-maintained school sector; that is what it is charged with doing and that is how it will be expected to operate. There is no point in setting up such an agency if it will be directed on its day-to-day operations by the Secretary of State—he should provide guidance, but certainly not day-to-day operational control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had in mind reports that have come from several organisations, such as that from the National Curriculum Council, in which one of its former heads complained bitterly about day-to-day interference by a Secretary of State. Will there be something in black and white for the funding agency to use as guidance or will it suffer in a similar way as Duncan Graham did from interference by the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave the Committee to decide on how far they listen to ex-heads of anything who talk with bitterness or recrimination. We have a different Secretary

of State and a different head of the National Curriculum Council and I am sure that life is proceeding on a smoother path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to persuade the Committee that it would be wrong and unwise to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister telling the Committee that if a regional committee is set up according to the Bill, the funding agency for schools will be responsible for the appointment and running of that committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would expect that members of the committee would be established by the funding agency itself. Paragraph 8(2) of schedule 1 states:
	<br><q><p>"The number of the members of a committee established … and the terms on which they are to hold and vacate office, shall be fixed by the authority."</p></q>
Paragraph 8(3) states:
	<br><q><p>"Such a committee may include persons who are not members of the authority."</p></q>
That is an important consideration because the authority would be given considerable freedom to bring in local people as it thought necessary, which meets many of the Opposition's objections. Paragraph 8(4) continues:
	<br><q><p>"The authority shall keep under review the structure of committees established by them and the scope of each committee's activities."</p></q>
That would be a practical arrangement, which would allow a sensitive reflection of the varying circumstances that might occur to be met by the funding agency.

If members of the Committee study paragraph 8, they will find all the powers and flexibilities needed by the funding agency to respond to the needs of Opposition members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but I shall wind up soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he does not propose to accept the amendments. He is trying to persuade the Committee that there will come a point when the dominant form in education will be the opted-out school. While no Minister can guarantee what his successors might do, will the Minister guarantee that if the opted-out school became the dominant form in education and the funding agency did not establish regional committees, the Minister would ensure that they would be established?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly shall give no such guarantee. If a future Secretary of State believed that the funding agency were not responding adequately or discharging its duties properly during the development of the grant-maintained sector throughout the country, I should be surprised if he did not say to the funding agency that it should develop its regional presence—that strikes me as being self-evident and in the interests of the Secretary of State, the funding agency and the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot emphasise too strongly that we want the grant-maintained sector to grow, prosper and develop. I believe that the funding agency's activities will be essential to that process and that, if necessary, a regional presence may develop. I have no problem with that. I do not want to suggest that we have a doctrinal hang up about the concept of regional representation or regional committees. However, the amendment would pre-empt that process, make it rigid and inflexible and waste resources on a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
regional structure that might not be justified ever, or at least not for a long time. That is why I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister hopes that he has said enough to convince us not to support the amendment. However, he has not convinced me and I should be surprised if he has convinced other hon. Members on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he had the impression that Opposition Members were satisfied with the current arrangements. I suspect that I speak for all of us on these Benches in saying that we are not satisfied. No one is satisfied with the current underfunding of our schools and the Bill will do nothing to deal with that. The Bill will also do nothing to rectify the low morale in the teaching profession or the state of school buildings and the £4·3 billion that is needed for the backlog of repair and maintenance. Therefore, we are not satisfied with the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not satisfied either with a Bill that further worsens education in certain areas. In my constituency, which is part of the county of Avon, Government poll-tax capping has meant a 4 per cent. cut in the education budget and is likely to lead to an 8 per cent. cut in next year's budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister in one respect. He said that he would like further devolution of power and responsibility to individual schools. Liberal Democrats have long argued for that. However, we have always argued, and will continue to argue, that that must be within a local democratically accountable strategic planning framework that has also other responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said about the amendment revealed that, although it could be framed better, he agrees with the principle of regional development. Perhaps we should give ourselves more time to consider that and reintroduce it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall pick up that point in a few minutes. I admit that I am not quite as optimistic as the hon. Member for Bridgend in his interpretation of the Minister's view on the matter. However, we could see a few chinks of light in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that a fundamental principle divides hon. Members on the Conservative Benches from those on the Opposition Benches. Hon. Members on the Opposition Benches have a greater belief in local democracy and in the need to devolve power in the concept of—to use a word used already this evening—subsidiarity. I have no doubt that Conservative Members are much more interested in the centralisation of power. They want more and more power to be placed in the hands of Government, represented by the Secretary of State. There is a fundamental division between us in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we were wrong to try to predict what would happen and to provide for it by means of a regional structure. That is the most sensible form of planning, which is lacking in the Government's approach. They legislate first and think afterwards. We believe in planning. If there are to be funding authorities, their structure should be planned to last. The Secretary of State told us that the Bill would introduce measures that would last well into the next century. Forward planning is vital. I predict that if the mechanism for regional committees is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
not established now, problems will result from the removal of local democracy and accountability. Equally important is the removal of local eyes and ears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that it would be wrong to establish regional committees now because there would be nothing for them to do. When the funding agency and the funding council for Wales are established, there will be many things for regional committees to do, even in areas where the 10 per cent. criterion has not been reached and the funding authorities are merely responsible for the distribution of funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there would be a common funding formula. Therefore, it is vital for people in the regions to consider how the common funding formula is working there and to feed back comments. Surely, the Minister must want eyes and ears on the ground to consider the application of the common funding formula; they will not get it right first time. There have been 17 education Bills in 13 years and the Government have got none of them right, so there is no reason to believe that they will get the common funding formula right first of all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional committees could do many other things, right from the word go. The funding authorities will be responsible for the allocation of capital grants. It is vital to have people on the ground locally who can advise the funding authority on bids from the wider area. It is vital, too, that local people can work with the LEAs on behalf of the funding authorities, making contacts and building close working links with educational establishments and other groups within the locality. They could feed information to the remote central body proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be familiar with the fact that there is a vital need
	<br><q><p>"to monitor the efficiency and value for money of its activities and to seek improvements".</p></q>
That phrase comes from the document of guidance for non-departmental public bodies, to which the Minister referred us. Unless local people observe what goes on, they cannot effectively monitor even the efficiency of the grant distribution mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to the distinction between "shall" and "may". I am happy that the word "shall" is included in respect of the establishment of regional committees. I want the regional committees to be established as soon as possible. I am happy that the rest of the amendment allows the establishment of other committees at the discretion of the funding authority. I am also pleased that the word "shall" appears for a second time in the amendment, which states that the regional committees
	<br><q><p>"shall include persons with experience of educational provision in that region".</p></q>
It is vital to bring that local knowledge to bear on the work of the funding authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard little from the Minister about a commitment to regionalisation. Indeed, a commitment to local government is missing in almost all that the Minister and his colleagues have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as confident as the hon. Member for Stretford about the Minister's intentions. However, I recognise that, unless we have the opportunity of discussing the issue with Conservative Members, there will be no possibility of establishing regional committees. It is important that we find a way of persuading the Government that a regional mechanism should exist. However, I am willing to withdraw the amendment so that such discussions can take
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
place. I do that in the firm hope that it will be possible to persuade at least some Conservative Members of the rightness of our argument before the Bill becomes law. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>GRANTS TO FUNDING AUTHORITIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 is important. It should not pass without comment from hon. Members on both sides, because I know that concern about it extends to many people of a different political persuasion to those who sit on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
Clause 4 gives sweeping powers to the Secretary of State for Education, powers that seem to be unfettered and that require no accountability whatever. It is short and states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may make grants to any funding authority of such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine."</p></q>
The Secretary of State alone will determine the amount of grants, and he alone will determine the terms and conditions that go with those grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That amount of power is considerable. To put such power in the hands of the Secretary of State gives us great cause for concern—a concern that is shared by many people. I am sure that some Conservative Members will have heard from their local Conservative councillors. Opposition Members certainly have received representations from the shire counties, who are proud of their role over the years in providing education. Whatever disagreements we may have with them about how that job is best performed, there is unanimity among them that a local delivery of services will be better than one controlled at the centre by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 confirms our worst fears that the Bill is about centralising power. In one sense, the Secretary of State's absence is all the more strange, because the power given him in clause 4 is so clear. I cannot believe that modesty keeps him away, and he cannot be visiting schools at this time of night. He could have listened to part of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about night school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, when I taught at night school, it was normally finished by this time, and any homework had been conducted in public houses or other places condusive to the constructive discussion that often accompanies such classes. I doubt that that is where the Secretary of State is now, but the junior Minister may know better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate to remind the Committee of some of the remarks made by the Association of County Councils. Conservative Members may not like them, but they show the strength of public feeling. The association, which is not dominated by the Labour party, has said that the Bill is constitutional because part I, and clause 4 in particular, transfers so much power to the Secretary of State. If the clause and the Bill ring alarm bells in the Conservative-controlled county councils, it is right to give clause 4 proper consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason for pausing and considering the clause in some detail is the statement, repeated on Second Reading, that grant-maintained status involves opting out of local authority supervision. The clause shows that schools going into the grant-maintained sector will be opting into centralised Government control. We should be perfectly clear about the degree of control schools will face once they are in the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is specific: it says that the Secretary of State can give any amount that he wishes and that he can attach any terms and conditions to the grants. Any right-wing pressure group that happens to have the Secretary of State's ear may have its whims and its latest silly idea put into practice; it may become a condition to which the funding authority must adhere before money can be distributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may say that he will fund the funding authority only if it insists that all schools are selective. He may fund the funding authority only on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
condition that all the schools involved have blue school uniforms or striped shirts with ridiculous white collars and clashing ties. The clause gives the Secretary of State powers to lay down any terms and conditions. We should restrain that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant-maintained schools will face problems as a result of the Secretary of State exercising his powers. In August 1992 the Department for Education sent a letter to the chairmen of governors of all grant-maintained schools. It says:
	<br><q><p>"you will be aware that we face a difficult public expenditure round … that funding across the board will be constrained". That was before black Wednesday and the fiasco that followed. A paragraph headed "Ineligible projects" it says: "there are likely to be a large number of bids submitted under those headings of which very many will be disappointed. We consider it sensible, therefore, to set out those areas which are not eligible for support. We understand that schools with projects in these areas may feel disadvantaged by not being able to propose projects which they need. But in the climate of limited funds there are greater demands to be met and schools should not incur expenditure in preparing bids which have no chance of success."</p></q>
The Secretary of State was already warning the grant-maintained sector that he has control of the purse-strings and that he will decide what projects to fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that in the autumn statement the Government claimed to be committed to capital projects but provided no addition money for capital projects in schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The letter that I quoted gives the Department's view before the public expenditure cuts. The timing of Second Reading was fortuitous for the Government because we would have had more ammunition had it been after the public expenditure round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remind my hon. Friend of the kind of projects that the Department has said it will not fund. Some might not be priorities, but schools bidding to become grant maintained often make great claims about what that will do for the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter also said that projects for swimming pools and sports halls, which are arguably not essential, should not be submitted, although such projects have been often dangled in front of parents to encourage them to vote for opting out. It also rules out projects for libraries and sixth-form blocks—essential items for many schools and the sort of provision which some advocates of opting out have implied would be available to a school that opted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An 11 to 16-year-old school in my constituency balloted on opting out. One of the key points of the campaign promoting opting out was: "Vote for opting out and you could have a sixth form." The letter demonstrates that argument to be fallacious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all power to determine terms and conditions for grants to the funding authority were to be in the hands of the Secretary of State, he would have direct control over what resources were given on what conditions to any school in the GM sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What degree of accountability would there be for the funds that would be provided to the funding authority under clause 4? That would be taxpayers' money, so it is extremely important that Parliament should have sufficient scrutiny of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Accountability was raised previously in the Committee. I remind the hon. Lady that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
the fifth report of the Select Committee on Education, Science and Arts drew attention to the fact that, under present arrangements, funds for education cannot be accounted for as she describes because of the natural progression of moneys from the Government through the standard spending assessments and exchequer grants. There is no accountability but, I am convinced, there would be under the proposed new funding agency. Will she address that point, which I have made before in Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that there are problems with the SSA arrangements. The disagreements between the Department for Education and the Department of the Environment on the matter are well known. It is one thing for the hon. Gentleman to propose that we reconsider the SSA, and I do not have a closed mind on that, but to lure schools out of the local authority sector, where there is direct public accountability, is quite another, and would be wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the hon. Lady again, but will she confirm that she thinks that, under present arrangements, accountability is unsatisfactory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always room for improvement of accountability, but there is nothing in the Bill to provide any accountability. The Government, and presumably the hon. Gentleman, are intent on destroying the present degree of accountability in education, which is, or should be, provided on an annual basis by local elections. That is the great strength of our democratic system and one of the strengths of accountability in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that a fault of the present system is the method of calculating standard spending assessments, which has discriminated against local authorities? If my local authority in Warrington received the same spending assessment as two London boroughs, it would be giving people poll tax money, not collecting it from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly the case. The way in which figures have been juggled to favour authorities such as Westminster—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fiddled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Juggled, fiddled. Late at night, I do not mind which word my hon. Friend prefers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us settle on fiddled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we shall settle on fiddled. A problem exists and we may see it again on Thursday when we receive more details from the Government about the difficulties that they will create for local authorities in the coming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue also raises the wider question of the equity of funding between the grant-maintained sector and the maintained sector. Nothing in the clause ensures that the Secretary of State will have even an elementary sense of justice when funding the two sectors. Of course, the Secretary of State is in a difficult position because he would like the bribe given to schools to opt out to continue, but Treasury constraints have operated on him and he will be limited in what he can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should explore those legitimate points further. If the Minister can give some basic assurances on them, it would be helpful. So far, when Ministers have been challenged to guarantee a level playing field, they have backed away from providing such a guarantee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to recall that that came up on Second reading. I think that I said in reply to one of the hon. Lady's hon. Friends that there certainly was not a level playing field and that there would not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote the highest authority in the land—a letter of August 1991 from the Prime Minister, no less—to a gentleman called Mr. McAvoy. The Prime Minister wrote:
	<br><q><p>"We have made no secret of the fact that GM schools get preferential treatment in allocating grants to capital expenditure."</p></q>
That was written in the context of our desire to ensure that grant-maintained schools were properly treated in respect of their additional responsibilities. I give the hon. Lady that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting because the Secretary of State has refused to say that on many occasions. He simply says that grant-maintained schools must be compensated for the extra administrative burden that they take on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has implied that there would be preference in capital expenditure, but we shall return to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered whether it is easy to reconcile the Prime Minister's letter in the middle of last year with the letter, to which my hon. Friend referred earlier, from the Secretary of State for Education to the chairs of grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chairs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Minister aspires to be a member of the Cabinet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend believe that the Secretary of State's letter, which was written in August this year, reflects the country's present economic difficulties caused by the Government's mismanagement? The Secretary of State clearly states that capital will not be made available on a preferential basis. One would have thought that that countermanded the Prime Minister's letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have some interesting debates when we discuss the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind my hon. Friends of the press release that was issued by the Department for Education today. I am sure that the Minister is aware of it. It implies that grant-maintained schools will be funded on the basis of the SSAs in their areas. Even up to today, there is confusion between Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the Prime Minister, who takes some interest in education. The Prime Minister's interest comes from a peculiar standpoint and it is not entirely consistent with the Prime Minister's willingness to defend his previous speeches on other occasions. I do not know why the Prime Minister signs himself "John M"—who else called John would write to me from 10 Downing street? Perhaps it is to distinguish himself from "John P", who may harbour ambitions of becoming Prime Minister. Different statements by the Prime Minister, senior Ministers and junior Ministers about preferential treatment, which one Minister guarantees and another denies for grant-maintained schools, will make for interesting debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will update the Committee about the common funding formula. We have heard hints that it has suffered problems and is not progressing as quickly as it was hoped; that there will be winners and losers in the grant-maintained sector and that difficulties
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
will be experienced. It would save time later if the Minister told the Committee what consultation has taken place about the common funding formula and outlined the time scale for further announcements. That information is important not only to clause 4 but to others in the Bill. It may be difficult to make progress on other clauses without that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister should consult the Minister of State, Welsh Office and outline the current state of play with the common funding formula in Wales? The position in Wales is different because there are no specific SSAs for services in Wales, as there are in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Welsh should consider themselves fortunate, given the difficulties that SSAs have caused in many parts of England. The position in Wales should be clarified. I am glad that the Minister of State, Welsh Office is in Committee, as ever, and on time. I am sure that he will note the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen. Perhaps the Welsh Office Minister does not have the information to hand, but one of the Ministers should clarify the position.

The clause grants the Secretary of State enormous power. We enjoy reading the documents of the Conservative Education Association. I recommend them to Conservative Members. They are suitable bedtime reading for Conservative Members who are not otherwise occupied. The association describes the logical outcome of the Bill as the nationalisation of schools in England and Wales. That description is accurate. It may seem strange to Conservative Members that the Opposition do not support a move to nationalisation, whereas the Government promote it. The Conservative Education Association refers to
	<br><q><p>"the replacement of LEAs with a far larger, more bureaucratic and less accountable national education authority".</p></q>
I am sure that my hon. Friends—be they Welsh or of any other nationality—would agree with that description.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir John. I hope that you can assist Opposition Members, and the hon. Member for Bath in particular. We should like to know when the next break will occur. That information is especially important to the hon. Gentleman because during our last break he was outside the House being photographed in support of a national sleep-out for hostels for the homeless—an event organised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). The hon. Gentleman had his photograph taken sleeping out with homeless people and it would be most unfair to him and the British public if he were not allowed to continue with the event and sleep for the rest of the night. It will assist us if you, Sir John, will tell us when the next break will occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as the sleep-out does not become a sleep-in in the Committee, we may make a little more progress before the next break which I expect to take place in approximately two hours' time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier today, the Minister of State, Welsh Office commended the Bill on the ground that it was a great advance for democracy. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemworth (Mr. Enright) will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the word "democracy" has Greek roots, coming from "demos", and means rule by the people. There will be a strange form of democracy and rule by the people, given the powers provided to the Secretary of State by clause 4. Who will determine the level of funding and resourcing to grant-maintained schools through the funding agency? None other than our absent friend, the Secretary of State for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government said that they were in favour of unitary authorities, I assumed that they meant rule by one authority. It now seems clear that they mean rule by one person. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge said, coming from a Government who claim to be committed to subsidiarity, clause 4 is an incredibly centralising provision. Similarly, the Government claim to have a proud record of privatising industries, yet the Bill represents nationalisation on a grand scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have talked a great deal about the interests of consumers of education but from what we heard on Second Reading and in Committee, it is safe to assume that by "consumers" the Government mean "parents". I point out that the consumers of education in the United Kingdom are children, but there is precious little about children, either in the clause or in the rest of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving that quibble aside, let us consider the Government's strange assumption that parents are the consumers of education. What say will parents have in determining the level of payment to the funding agency? The answer is that they will have no say because the decision on the level of resourcing to the funding agency will come from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen in the extremely unlikely event that grant-maintained status and opting out become runaway successes? Will the level of resourcing and funding to thousands of grant-maintained schools be determined solely by the Secretary of State for Education? I am not interested in what Conservative Members may think of local education authorities. Opposition Members happily
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
accept that LEAs vary in quality, in the provision that is made available, in the amount of money that they spend and in how they spend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people are not satisfied with the way in which their LEA functions, at least they know that they can get rid of the people who run the county councils at the next county elections. Mention has been made of whether people vote in those elections on the basis of educational issues. I can speak only of my experience of the LEA for which I worked for five years, which covers the area where I still live in Lancashire. That authority was created in 1974 and has been Labour-controlled since 1981, precisely because of its education policy and the way in which it delivers its education service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a parent—described by the Government as a "consumer"—does not like the way in which the funding agency is resourced or the decisions that the Secretary of State can make under the Bill, he or she will have no redress to the Secretary of State. Reference was made earlier to the alleged remoteness of councillors who serve on education committees. If a parent is unhappy with how the local LEA is functioning, it is not that difficult to telephone the local authority and contact the councillor in question. However, it would be relatively difficult for an anxious parent with children in a GM school who was dissatisfied about how it was resourced to have a chat on the telephone with the Secretary of State for Education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is never here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant when he was here. Will the Minister be a little more specific about the terms and conditions in the clause? It is fairly typical of the Government to talk about parent power—consumer power—when they are vesting more power in the Secretary of State. Will the hon. Gentleman pass on to the Secretary of State details of one condition that might be required of the funding agency? Given that the largest number of GM schools are secondary schools and that the greater financial weighting is attached to older pupils, the 15 or 16 per cent. that GM schools have added to their budgets is often greater than the central LEA services that they used previously. Can the Minister guarantee that GM schools will receive the money that could and should be spent on children with special needs, but who are not statemented? Worry has been expressed in my LEA area that that money is not being spent on such children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the later problems in the Bill is the vagueness of the specifications that are laid down for resourcing of non-statemented children with special needs. Will the Minister assure us that the Government will use the powers given to the Secretary of State under the clause to tell the funding agency that it must have a minimum amount of ring-fencing for children with special needs, but who are not statemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help me and the Committee if the hon. Gentleman identified the schools about which he makes that serious allegation. I hope that he will give me details, so that I can look into the matter. It would help even more if he identified how grant-maintained schools are operating differently from—worse or better than—LEA-maintained schools in that respect. Will he describe how far LEA schools are ring-fenced as compared with grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has misunderstood me, I hope not wilfully. I suggest that at present much is provided
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
centrally to county schools by the LEA, but that schools that opt out may choose not to buy such provisions. Many services provided by LEAs are not identified in the Bill. For example, neither the Education Act 1981 nor the Bill mentions children who have emotional and behavioural difficulties. The 1981 Act and the Bill refer to the impact of learning difficulties on education, but there is no mention of children with emotional difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised a valuable point about the provision of support for children with special needs, whether state-funded or not. In the past two years, it seems that children with behavioural and emotional difficulties have been most readily excluded from schools. My hon. Friend certainly needs to explore the point further with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. One of the best education services in Lancashire has been the school support service. The service was previously available free of charge to any school that needed to call it, to work with children who do not have a statement but who present problems within the classroom because of disruptive or emotional behavioural difficulties. That service is disappearing. I should like to be assured of a minimum specified funding for the grant-maintained sector to buy in that resource rather than such children being excluded, as suggested by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about choice but if choice is to mean anything, it must be fair choice. I was interested in the Minister's views, which he explained at length earlier and in his speech on Second Reading, about the lack of a level playing field. We know that the Government are not interested in fair choice. We are opposed to those extra powers being vested in the Secretary of State but, if they are to be left with him, we should expect at least that he will use them progressively to ensure a proper choice for parents between county schools and the grant-maintained sector. However, the Government are interested only in bribing parents and schools into opting out, as has already been admitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 catches the essence of the Bill. It is about centralising power. It is about giving more power to the Secretary of State rather than to consumers or parents. It is about destroying local democracy. In short, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said earlier, nothing in the Bill addresses the needs of children, but there is plenty about increasing power of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading, I said that, if the Government had announced their education reforms by saying that they were about to abolish local education authorities, centralise control of state education provisions and introduce selection, the Bill would have caused an outcry in the educational community and would have been rejected by the public at large. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Ministers and Conservative Back-Bench Members seem to take exception to that point of view. Clause 4 supports my contentions about the effect of the Bill. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may make grants to any funding authority of such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine."</p></q>
That will ensure that the three things about which I argued will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
12.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amounts of money that may be made available by the Secretary of State may mean that the amount spent on state education is reduced. There could be a cut in revenue. Teachers were told, following the autumn statement, that they must take what, in real terms, is a pay cut. LEAs may want to provide funds to enhance teachers' pay, but I suspect, given the Chancellor of the Exchequer's directive, that the funding agency for schools would do exactly as it was told. There is thus a clear difference of opinion about how clause 4 will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends the Members for Dewsbury and for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) said, clause 4 will give the Secretary of State for Education enormous power. He will determine how much money is spent and on what, because of his control of the actions of the funding agency for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pertinent to ask who the Secretary of State will consult before he takes such decisions. Will he consult the teachers who are responsible for delivering state education? If he asks them how much money should be spent and what it should be spent on, they will say that it should be spent on reducing class sizes. If he were to ask practitioners in education, they would say that money should be spent on regularly upgrading and repairing the fabric of buildings. More money should be available for capital investment in schools. They may be reassured if the Secretary of State were to spend money on properly funding the changes introduced in schools—changes to the general certificate of secondary education, and the introduction of the national curriculum and testing at seven, 11 and 14, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that teachers would tell the Secretary of State for Education that they wanted no more change, but merely to get on with delivering education services. There has been so much change in the past 13 years that it is time to take stock and to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State consult parents and parent-teacher associations when he is considering what to spend on education? If so, they would say that they wanted more books in schools and would tell him that to ensure that the English curriculum contains Shakespeare, he should see that there are enough copies of books to go round the class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are lots of spare books in schools because the changes in curriculum have made large numbers of textbooks redundant. In my local authority books were collected to take to Czechoslovakia. I was told on a visit there in February 1991 that the teaching of English in schools was proscribed under the Warsaw pact, so they now need English books. I asked my wife—who, as I have said before, is an English teacher—to collect the spare sets of textbooks that she had that were no longer relevant to her curriculum. She did so and we took them over as a first offering. As a result of a general collection in Warrington, 10 tonnes of books were sent over in a lorry, and those books were of some use. That project was called "Czechbook 92", and there will be a "Czechbook 93". If hon. Members have any spare books that they would like us to take over to the Nachod region of Czechoslovakia, I am sure that they will be gratefully received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents were consulted by the Secretary of State about where money should be spent by the funding agency, I am sure that parents in rural areas would say that they would like better transport facilities. Will the Secretary of State direct the funding agency for schools to look into that? Parents may want money to be spent on a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
range of items. What about parental requests for the provision of nursery education? I am sure that we shall discuss this later in our deliberations, but such provision is not a statutory requirement at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State consult local councils when he is determining how much money will be spent by the funding agency and where? Will he ask them about the educational needs of their areas? Will he go to the community groups and ask for their views about the educational requirements for their communities? Will resources be provided by the funding agency for schools? When the Secretary of State wields his huge power to control education, will he consult parish councils in England and Wales to find out their views? That is what the need for consultation means in a democracy, as will be repeated time and again. Will the Secretary of State consult those bodies as he decides about the money that he awards to the funding agency under clause 4? I look forward to the Minister's answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State consult the bodies that represent national interest groups? Will he consult the Confederation of British Industry, which has stated that we need an educated work force to build a prosperous economy? What will the CBI say about the amount of funding going into education, or into training and enterprise councils? Those are big issues, but clause 4 makes it clear that the power to decide what money should be spent and where belongs only to the Secretary of State for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State consult the British Psychological Society? The issue of special needs is very important. The Bill presumes that there will be more integration into our ordinary, mainstream schools of children with special needs. The British Psychological Society, which represents the interests of educational psychologists, may well have something to say about how much money should be spent in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State consult the people who represent the groups with special needs about how much money should be spent on their branch of education, and where? I shall return later and in more detail to special needs education, a fundamental question which my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn has already raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State consult the residual LEAs? After all, they have been responsible for education since 1902, when the school boards that were set up in 1870 as directly elected representatives of communities providing education were abolished. The role of LEAs was enhanced in a partnership deal in 1944. Will the Secretary of State ask the residual LEAs about the educational needs—and the money that must be spent to meet them—in the communities that they have represented for so long?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, clause 4 centralises the state control of education in the hands of the Secretary of State for Education. Anybody who has the sole responsibility to determine how much money is spent and to issue guidelines on the terms and conditions as to the way in which it is spent exercises great power. There is little democratic control over the way that such power is exercised. It confirms our worst fears. Rab Butler spoke in support of the Education Act 1944 and the creation of the Minister of State for Education, a speech to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth referred last Thursday. Butler gave a commitment not to allow the Minister of State for Education to become some kind of educational dictator. The power that is vested in the hands
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
of one Secretary of State to decide on the amount of money and where it should be spent confirms my worst fears that Rab Butler's intentions for the Education Act 1944 have been superseded. We now have centralised control of education in the hands of the Minister. I apologise, I meant the Secretary of State, although I am sure that he will advise his Secretary of State and pass on some of our concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He may have aspirations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to speculate about what changes will take place on the Government Bench, but at least he is here and is still awake. I think that I am just about awake as well. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Maybe the Secretary of State is asleep—if he has any sense, he will be in bed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The control of finance brings to my mind the old saying, "They who control the purse strings call the shots." The Secretary of State for Education will be controlling the purse strings. Central Government will not be responsible for contributing the total amount of money that is spent on education, but, because of the way that the clause is worded, the Secretary of State for Education will have total control, which prompts a question about the role of Parliament in the central funding of state education. Vast amounts of public money are being spent on state education, which should be subject to democratic scrutiny and control. Under clause 4 in particular, there is no democratic accountability. The Secretary of State exercises total control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the non-governmental body will be accountable to the Secretary of State, will follow the guidelines referred to by the Under-Secretary of State for Schools and will be subjected to the control of an auditor general's report and may make reports to the public accounts committee. All those safeguards are absolutely necessary, but they are not the means of democratic accountability; they are the means of securing financial probity. We want democratic accountability within the education provision, particularly where taxpayers' money is being spent. There should be reference to a democratic appointment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not one of the best forms of accountability in the education system the publication of examination results—a move that he and his colleagues seem to refute totally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting intervention. I understand that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend about the inclusion of special schools in the league tables that were published. It is nonsense to include special schools in any league table. That achieves nothing and shows that the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
Government do not understand the issues. I am not against the publication of information. The publication of accurate information would add validity to the educational game that takes place in our schools. Such validity is clearly lacking from the crude statistics that were published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that by publishing exam results they have achieved some democratic accountability. However, that is no concession to democratic accountability if the people who exercise that accountability at local level are to be removed, and it does not compensate for the abolition of locally elected education authorities, which is a retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the role of the Chancellor of the Exchequer under clause 4? The Secretary of State for Education will decide how much money is to be provided for the funding agency and how it is to be spent. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will, no doubt, have something to say about the global sum available for spending on education. We saw in the autumn statement the global sum that the Government had allocated for the funding of the state education system. That brings me back to the parliamentary accountability of the Secretary of State and the operation of the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The global sum mentioned in the autumn statement does not give the complete picture. Education funding contains three elements. There is the central Government grant contained in the revenue support grant, which is based on standard spending assessment. We all know that that benefits some local authorities and disadvantages others; I provided an example earlier. Local authorities spend part of their poll tax money on the education system, and I am sure that they also use the uniform business rate, which is collected locally, given to the Government and redistributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When schools opt out and achieve grant-maintained status, they are subject to the funding arrangements for the local management of schools, whereby the budgets are devolved to the schools for them to spend. Depending on when they opted out, they also take 16, 15 or between 12 and 15 per cent. for added-on costs for the services that they will have to purchase from their LEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding formula thus includes a central Government grant in the revenue support grant, poll tax money collected locally, which is subject to local decisions about how it is spent, and money derived from the uniform business rate. Under the clawback arrangement, the Secretary of State makes a calculation when a school opts out and reduces the LEA's grant to cover the cost to the Government of providing those funds direct to the opted-out school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Secretary of State decides how much money is to be given to the funding agency for schools, will he consult the poll tax payers, who have made their contribution to the delivery of a local education service? He will determine the global sum to be allocated to the funding agency for schools, which will be funded partly by the poll tax payers, so they are entitled to be consulted about how their money is to be spent. Will he simply tell the LEAs that he will take X per cent. of their money from them? How will the arrangement operate? It is important for local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
If the Secretary of State for Education wants the power in clause 4 to determine how much money is spent on education and how it is distributed, why does not the Government provide the funds from the centre? If he wants the power, he should be prepared to pay. Apart from the democratic argument for local education provision, one of the reasons for resisting centralisation, which was recognised by previous Conservative Governments, was that if central Government had absolute control, they would have to find the full cost. The Government are trying to rake off money from the poll tax payer. The Secretary of State should make it clear how he intends to fund the funding agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant-maintained schools will receive their local management of schools budget plus 15 per cent. That is an historic figure and we are told that there will be no detriment to existing levels of funding for grant-maintained schools. In the past couple of years, the amount of money that local authorities have delegated to local management of schools has increased, but the 16 per cent. add-on costs have remained the same. LEAs have paid for that increase by reducing their central services. Under the present funding arrangements, grant-maintained schools could receive money twice for the same thing. Does the Minister realise that and will he tell us how he intends to remove that anomaly from the funding arrangements under clause 4, which give the Secretary of State such powers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister accept that when schools opt out and take their local management of schools budget and their 15 per cent. on-cost, there is no pro rata savings for the central services provided by LEAs? There may be some savings, but not pro rata. Therefore, the cost of central services will increase pro rata; it will be covered by a smaller funding base in the existing LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that when LEA funding is reduced because a school has opted out, it is not always possible to reduce the support services that are funded by the LEA centrally? For example, it is essential for the team providing the psychological service to have different skills and specialisations. It is impossible to reduce the number of people in the team and still provide a decent service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend provides a good example to illustrate my point. Certain central services are essential. As schools opt out, the funding base to provide such services will be reduced. Cheshire local education authority provides schools with support for special education needs before children are statemented. It allows mainstream schools to manage within the system the 18 per cent. of pupils with specific learning difficulties. That service will be under great threat unless the Minister makes some concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister intend to advise the Secretary of State to deal with the matter of the on-cost that is given to grant-maintained schools in addition to local management of schools funding? It is conceivable that a grant-maintained school will receive the 12 to 15 or 16 per cent. additional funding, but not spend it on central services from the LEA. That would present major difficulties. When the Minister has consulted the Secretary of State, perhaps he will tell the Committee about the amounts to be distributed and the conditions and services attached to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
that by funding agencies and say whether it is accepted that grant-maintained schools should receive only the amount that they spend, not the notional 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem arises from clause 4. Perhaps the Minister can give us guidance. The Government have implied that grant-maintained schools will be funded on a consistent basis, that no school will be financially disadvantaged by moving to grant-maintained status, and that new arrangements will not involve an increase in public expenditure. Can the Minister explain how that requirement for the funding of the schools will be implemented under clause 4? There is disparity in the funds that grant-maintained schools receive which relates to the point at which they opted out of local authority control. The committee could do with some guidance from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further problem with clause 4 concerns current expenditure on education. LEAs contribute towards education expenditure in their areas. This contribution is based on the amount of Government grant that they receive from revenue support grant, and on the amount of poll tax and uniform business rate that they wish to contribute to providing local education services. Some local authorities spend above their SSA. How will the Secretary of State deal with this problem under clause 4? Given first, the commitment not to disadvantage financially grant-maintained schools, and, secondly, in some areas, the enhanced spending above the SSA, will the right hon. Gentleman continue historic spending above the SSA? If he does so because of his disinclination to disadvantage grant-maintained schools financially when they receive that status, how will he fund this continuing expenditure? Will the money come from the central purse or will he levy poll tax payers? If he does the latter, a constitutional issue arises over the way in which poll tax payers may be consulted about how their money is being spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister draws a deep breath. It is important that he consider this point carefully and be frank with the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put the same question the other way round. Some local authorities spend below their SSA. When their schools opt out and apply for, and receive, grant-maintained status, will the funding agency, acting under clause 4 and the Secretary of State's control, continue historic underfunding while increasing the funding to SSA level? If so, where will the money come from? Will the agency force councils in areas that, traditionally, have underfunded education services to increase council tax to pay for the increase in that funding, or will they expect it to be found from other local authority budgets?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) mentioned the concept of a level playing field for grant-maintained schools. The Under-Secretary said that the Government had never made a commitment to that concept. Let me quote the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) December 1987. He said:
	<br><q><p>"Meanwhile, let me stress and make clear that these schools will offer free education. They will be funded at the same level as they would have been had they remained under their local authority. There will continue to be an equality of public resourcing."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 1 December 1987; Vol. 123, c. 778.]</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
The right hon. Gentleman, speaking on Second Reading of the "great" Education Reform Bill—also known as Gerbil but there was nothing great or reforming about it—gave that commitment to a level playing field. It did not take the Government long to back down on that commitment. On Second Reading on 10 November, the Under-Secretary of State for Schools quoted the Secretary of State for Education, who had said the previous day:
	<br><q><p>"I have written to all schools in the country with the very specific assurance that schools accepted for GM status will continue to receive funding that recognises the extra responsibilities they have as GM schools—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 November 1992; Vol. 213, c. 835.]</p></q>
That is a clear admission from the Government that they are not interested in a level playing field and that they wish to disadvantage schools in the maintained sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a letter from the Secretary of State which was sent to all members of the Select Committee on 9 November in which he explains about local education authorities that spend above their education SSAs. He deals with funding in some depth and ends:
	<br><q><p>"Quite apart from the evidence of convergence, it is simply not credible for LEAs to say this far ahead of the introduction of the Common Funding Formula that they know they will be spending above their education SSA in 1994 and beyond and that this extra money will be targeted within school budgets. Even if this were to be the case, I am happy to stick by my assurances to schools accepted for GM status that they will receive additional money, over and above what is in their school budgets from the LEA, to reflect their extra responsibilities as GM schools'</p></q>
He reiterates what he said on Second Reading and he clearly means that he will bribe schools to opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, which confirms the Minister's view: that one of the two routes to grant-maintained status occurs when a local authority attempts to rationalise its school places and close schools; those schools invariably apply to opt out and, with few exceptions, their applications have been granted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may have been some cases where that was so. It is no longer the case and the Secretary of State has said repeatedly—I am happy to reiterate it for the Committee—that any school that seeks grant-maintained status mainly to avoid closure will almost certainly not succeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention and if the Minister's assurance found its way into the Bill, we should be even more reassured. My big worry about the Bill was that local authorities, which are expected to rationalise school places, would have to close schools. When faced with closure, schools would apply to opt out and, although I accept what the Minister said, would achieve grant-maintained status. Therefore, local education authorities would be reluctant to threaten schools with closure because they would be contributing to their own demise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be no limit on the terms and conditions in clause 4 that the Secretary of State may wish to impose on the use of the money that he awards to the funding agency for schools. This morning I talked about the introduction of selection. One condition could be that, in any area, 10 to 20 per cent. of school places should be made available on the basis of selection. It could herald the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
reintroduction of the 11-plus and of grammar schools—unless the Bill provides elsewhere for constraints on the Secretary of State's actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried that if a school applies for grant-maintained status halfway through the academic year, when the grants for local authorities have been calculated on the standard spending assessments set out in the autumn statement and provided for in the budget that financial year, what will happen to that money? How will the problem of schools being granted opt-out status in the meantime be solved? A response from the Minister on that point would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms and conditions that wil be laid down on the funding agency interest me because one of my constituents has a problem with this. What happens to students who must re-sit their A-levels and to whom the statutory provision of education between the ages of five and 16 no longer applies? They are not entitled to LEA grants or to income support because they are in full-time education and they are trying to get qualifications that may enable them to proceed in the education system. However, they are outside the system. Will the funding agencies apply terms and conditions to schools stipulating that students in such a position will have places in sixth-form colleges and sixth forms of secondary schools in England and Wales? That is not a statutory provision and the Minister needs to deal with the issue in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the integration of pupils with special needs into mainstream schools. I have worked with such children and I am committed to integration. Schools should be ready to receive disadvantaged or disabled pupils. Some school buildings will need to be adapted and modified especially to give children in wheelchairs access to mainstream schools. Will a condition applied by the Secretary of State under clause 4 make a grant conditional on schools using money to adapt school buildings to give children with special educational needs access to them? Will those terms and conditions also include extra revenue and resources to ensure that the special educational needs of children in mainstream schools are provided for? Will extra support services be supplied to allow the integration to take place? Will there also be a provision on nursery education? Those terms and conditions needs to be addressed by the Minister in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the Bill will lead to centralisation. It will not improve the quality of education and may serve to undermine it. During the proceedings, there may be a response from the Government and Conservative Members which suggests that they are not still held captive by Thatcherite doctrine and are prepared to put the interests of education and state school children before their political dogma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South, who has made such an excellent expose of the problems with the clause. I take some pleasure from the fact that it is clause 4. Labour Members generally have great affection for a clause 4. I wish that we had the same enthusiasm for this one. Unfortunately it does not measure up to the idealism that we are used to in a clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, Gerbil gave the Secretary of State so many powers that we saw the worst excesses of Conservative Secretaries of State in taking power from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
local authorities, local people and the local area. This short clause exemplifies the devastating amount of power that the Secretary of State will confer on himself. In neither the Bill nor the White Paper has the Secretary of State given any sign of the nature of the funding for grant-maintained schools; that remains shrouded in mystery. We must guess whether it will cover all the aspects that my hon. Friends have mentioned, including special education needs and nursery provision. What will happen to young people who do not have statements but have exceptional special education needs, particularly those who are emotionally and behaviourally disturbed whom my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn described so eloquently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present funding system for grant-maintained schools poses problems. There is inequity between them and local education authority schools, inconsistencies in the Government's stated intentions for the new funding arrangements and a lack of information. Originally, the Government said that grant-maintained schools were to receive the same funding as LEA schools, but then there was a 16 per cent. add-on. That was followed by a study from Coopers and Lybrand when the Government took fright and reduced the add-on to 15 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That made me think about the way in which the Government treated inner London schools when they abolished the Inner London education authority. The transitional grants were reduced from £100 million in 1990 to £10 million in 1994. I wondered why inner London schools had to suffer so much in comparison to grant-maintained schools which may have had their funding snipped here and there but to no great degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem thrown up by the Coopers and Lybrand study was that the funding was based on the average for all schools. The records show that most of the very few schools that chose to opt out tend to be secondary schools, so they are larger in size and are given extra weight because of their older pupils. The overall effect of that fell on primary education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government talk endlessly about standards but if they wanted an input in standards, one would have thought that they would have given particular protection to primary education, where the fundamental basics are taught. An especially odd aspect of their funding formula is that if all the schools in a local education authority area chose to opt out at, say, the 16 per cent. level, that will cost more than the education budget in the authority's coffers. The Government apply a peculiar system of economics for the education of our children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to add to points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South, to which I hope that the Minister will respond. How will the money be apportioned? My hon. Friend said that if one were to ask that question of those who are involved in education—this applies especially in London—they would want that money spent on the fabric of the schools. Schools in London received about £30 million for repairs and maintenance, but that is only 35 per cent. of the identified amount needed to repair and maintain our crumbling schools. As we have said and will continue to say, the effect of the backlog of repairs and maintenance for schools greatly affects the education of our children. I am sure that parents in London and elsewhere would like schools to have inside toilets, roofs that did not leak, books in classrooms and a general enhancement of the environment in which teachers and children work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
1.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem affects London children more than children elsewhere. Other hon. Members have talked about county councils and the relationship between the councils, the schools, the governors and the parents. Until two and a half years ago, we still had the Inner London education authority. The Government abolished it on the ground that it was too centralising. They wanted to push education out to the boroughs—to give it back to the people, letting them discuss with local councillors what should happen in local schools. Yet, in this one clause, that concept is taken back, not only to regional level, or to parliamentary level, but into the hands of a single individual, the Secretary of State. I wonder about the contortions that the Government had to go through to make those changes. Under the ILEA, children could attend schools across borough boundaries. They did not necessarily attend the local school. How will parents in London cope with the plethora of agencies to be thrown up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further problem is the unsuitability of the SSA. We have talked about whether funding will be related to the SSA. Most of us believe that the SSA is inadequate and that proper funding is needed. That brings us to the conflict between the Government's stated aims. For example, the Government want grant-maintained schools to be consistently funded. They repeatedly said that no school would be financially disadvantaged by moving to grant-maintained status. They also said that the new arrangements will not involve increased public expenditure. Those three aims do not add up. They are inconsistent and contradictory. I hope that the Minister will try to square that circle, and justify those aims in terms of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems with a new funding formula is that there are winners and losers. We have seen that happen with our favourite funding system—the poll tax. We are already getting examples of the winners and losers under the new council tax. We should not be surprised that there will be winners and losers under the Bill. Our objection is that the losers will be the young people in local education authority schools, those who would benefit from nursery education, and those young people who have special education needs. How will the Minister answer parents who ask about what has happened to their children as a result of the changes to the formula? Grant-maintained schools have benefited from the winnings, but have generally been protected from the losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us whether the formula for grant-maintained schools will be as rigorous as that for local education authorities. Will the schools have to consult about that funding? Will information be published on the operation of the formula? What will be the contents of the formula?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister now answer the question that was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend last week? My hon. Friend said:
	<br><q><p>"There will be difficulties with the funding agency. If, as the Government say, the grant-maintained sector will be continually expanding, we will not know from one year to the next how many schools will be funded. That will have to be guessed. A sum will have to be allocated on the basis of the best possible projection. During the year it may become clear that not all the schools will achieve grant-maintained status."</p></q>
The crucial question for the Minister remains:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
	<br><q><p>"Will that money be held by grant-maintained schools, will it go back to a central pot of money or will it be allocated to the local education authority?"—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 19 November 1992; c. 73.]</p></q>
Under the clause, the Secretary of State would take such powers that it is inconceivable that he would be able to reflect the wishes, needs and aspirations of parents and children—I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn that children are the consumers. The Secretary of State would not be able to reflect their needs and aspirations. Will the Minister tell us how close the Secretary of State might get to doing that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we have, in all its stark obscenity—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] Everything that we abhor about the Bill is in clause 4, which Conservative Members may consider a laughing matter, but I certainly do not. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may make grants to any funding authority of such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as he may determine."</p></q>
There is a contradiction there. It does not say "to each funding authority", or "to either funding authority", it says, "to any funding authority". That runs contrary to the Minister's explanation during the previous debate. We asked for other funding authorities and suspected that the Minister and the Secretary of State had other funding authorities up their sleeves which they, like magicians, would produce as their present experiments began to fail. We expected them to say, "We shall produce this funding authority to put that right." It is doubtful that it would do so and the terms of the clause produce a tyranny: the tyranny of the Secretary of State. Whether it is a benevolent tyranny or one run by black beetle-browed men, it has the seeds of corruption within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That permeates all 255 clauses of the Bill and that is why we are suspicious of it. Is the tyrannical whim of the Secretary of State to be allowed to impose conditions on the funding authorities such as, for example, that they may appoint only certain people as heads—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be perfectly possible for the Secretary of State so to do under the clause. That is precisely the power that it would give him. If the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon) does not like that, he should vote against the clause, because it puts no qualification, nor does the Bill, on those powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Erewash is not here, but she was aghast earlier today when she said, "There we have, as an education chairman, someone who does not believe in God." I happen to believe firmly in God, but I would not disqualify a head because he or she was an agnostic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that the hon. Lady did not say that the chairman of the education committee—or the chairlady, I am not sure which it was—did not believe in God, but merely that he or she was an agnostic. My hon. Friend was being slightly unfair to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to be unfair to the hon. Member for Erewash, especially in her absence. I have heard the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland), who seems to have considerable influence with Ministers, speak on that specific topic. I wonder whether she would demand that the Secretary of State lays down as part of the conditions that no head teacher or teacher who believes in meditation, for example, should be appointed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
grant-maintained schools. The hon. Lady is against meditation; she considers that it is appalling to think on the existence of the universe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such powers can be exercised by the Secretary of State under those terms and conditions which, as I said, are not qualified. The Government produced a paper entitled "Choice and Diversity"—choice and diversity, that is, as long we go along with what the Secretary of State demands. It is his choice and the diverse aspects are what he deems to be diverse. That is wrong. It is taking away from the British education system that which was its glory—diversity in unity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be choice, even under the Bill, will the Minister guarantee that the Secretary of State will pay for transport or boarding costs to give children a real choice of which school they attend? For example, if people living in parts of Devon, Cornwall or in the Dales in north Yorkshire wish to exercise a real choice of secondary school, the children would have to travel considerable distances—in some cases, more than 100 miles. Will the Secretary of State use his powers to insist that individual schools, individual LEAs or individual funding authorities are given special sums to allow a real choice to be made? The Government base their choice on what are essentially compact inner-city areas where it is easy to travel. They have not thought the policy through for other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the powers assist the Secretary of State to make arbitrary decisions to interfere in the details of the national curriculum? It is no good Conservative Members arguing that he would not do that, because he already has. There is an argument for the national curriculum if we support children learning A, B, C, D and E. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South said, when we examine the details of the English syllabus as the Secretary of State instructed, problems occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had taught under such a diktat, I would not have been able to use the writings of Plautus or Terence. The Secretary of State might find bits of Horace a little unpalatable, too. Which books of Virgil would I have been allowed to use? The way in which the use of Shakespeare was restricted was an utter scandal. What about the way in which Chaucer pops up? I yield to none in my admiration for Chaucer. There is a time and a place for him, but I do not think it is when a person is 15 or 16 years old. What more will the Secretary of State do under the remit provided by clause 4?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Voluntary aided schools are important. Schools want to maintain their special denominational or religious ethos. The Bill provides for that, but clause 4 can override those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If voluntary aided schools are to become grant-maintained, it is important that they receive cast-iron guarantees about how they can continue to operate. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth will bear out that, in mystic thinking, it is important for the individual in the community to feel that he or she is part of the community. To be part of the community is to show solidarity with it. Individual schools in cities that consider becoming grant-maintained should consult the people with whom they cohere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With Catholic schools it is important that buildings, systems and provisions fit in with one another, but also
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
that they fit in with state schools. That crucial philosophy should continue. The Opposition do not wish to take too long about the matter, but if I had the time, I would read the guidelines issued by the Bishop of Leeds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall. The guidelines state:
	<br><q><p>"If a school is considering seeking grant-maintained status the diocesan trustees should be consulted at all stages".</p></q>
That will not happen if only parents are consulted. The Minister of State at the Welsh Office said that only parents should be consulted. I disagree with that. However, if clause 4 is accepted, only the Secretary of State's view will matter. Other bodies should be consulted when decisions about education are made. The guidelines issued by the Bishop of Leeds also state:
	<br><q><p>"During the discussion and decision-making process full consideration should be paid not simply to any immediate financial benefit, but to the long-term future of the school and to its ability to maintain stable and effective government and to ensure that it is well-managed".</p></q>
Whenever any of my hon. Friends has asked about parents and whether future parents will be allowed to participate in decisions, the Government have ducked the issue. Yet the existence of our schools depended on past generations and will depend on future generations. The Government put education in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines also state:
	<br><q><p>"Governors should be fully aware of the wide-ranging added responsibilities which they will be required to undertake if their school becomes grant maintained. The importance of this must be fully appreciated".</p></q>
I fear that currently it is not. Some governors in grant-maintained schools have already received their comeuppance, and not only in the courts—although that has happened in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines continue:
	<br><q><p>"There must be full consultation internally with governors, parents and staff to avoid divisions among the community."</p></q>
The way in which ballots have been conducted so far—and I apportion no blame—has been nothing but divisive. They have riven their communities and left governors feeling wounded and hurt, irrespective of whether they favoured adopting grant-maintained status. In today's edition of 	<i>The Guardian</i> a governor testifies that he was vilified for standing out against GM status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are straying a long way from grants for funding authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will be delighted to know, Sir John, that I was about to return to that subject with my next quotation. The good relationships which should exist will not be fostered by clause 4. On the contrary, clause 4 will set person against person, family against family and, as has been said, school against school. It will do nothing for the community. Clause 4 gives the Secretary of State dictatorial powers to make people do what they do not want to do. However, I shall accept your ruling, Sir John, and refrain from going through the other 12 splendid principles enunciated by the bishop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 4, will the Secretary of State be able to rescue ailing private schools? I make no bones about the fact that in Surrey there are plenty of private schools which not only are ailing but are failing their students. The cost to the parents is enormous and the failure is because no Secretary of State for Education, in this or any previous Administration, has grasped the nettle and made sure that thorough and proper inspections take place in private schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V006P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
Even now, private schools are subject to very different rules. Because of the recession and for other reasons, some of those private schools will collapse in the next few years. It has been suggested that the Bill will empower the Secretary of State to compel the funding authorities to take on those schools. I shall be interested to hear what the Secretary of State thinks about that. He should consider the private sector for a moment. It regularly fails people. I am not talking about Eton, which does not have a rigorous entrance system and so does rather well by its pupils. The added value that Eton gives is considerable. However, a school such as Manchester grammar school is highly selective. The Secretary of State should look at the failures such a school produces. Given the super selectivity of schools such as Manchester grammar school, all pupils should go to Oxford—or to Cambridge, if they are not quite so bright.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Anne Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge. I had not noticed that she was in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am making a serious point. We should look at the schools which are selective and which fail many of their students. The Secretary of State should use these powers to do so. What used to happen in the days of yore, when children did well in the old school certificate exams and all standards were wonderful? The truth is that 15 per cent. of children—in some areas the figure was 20 per cent.—were chosen at 11. Of those, one third—the A stream—did well and got the equivalent of five or more GCSEs. The B stream's performance was half and the poor old C stream—well, we all knew where they were headed. I am talking about ordinary, run-of-the-mill grammar schools. At the time, it was thought fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what happens now. I shall take the Minister's tables, which he loves so dearly, to make my point. We should not forget that a C graded GCSE was a credit under the old school certificate, not a pass. We are talking about people getting five or more credits. In my constituency and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Mr. Lofthouse) the number of people getting five or more C grades or above at age 16, compared with the number who got the old school certificate, is five times greater. What a tremendous success comprehensive education has been in our area compared with the old system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
The powers to be given to the Secretary of State will not improve education. On the contrary, the hard work of teachers, parents and communities, businesses and trade unions which has produced this tremendous improvement, is being lightly cast aside because of the heathen wishes of the Secretary of State for Education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat what my hon. Friends have said so admirably—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh come on."] It is not my custom to repeat myself; no matter how much the Government would like an encore from me, I shall not give it. They can wait for the pantomime season. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth missed my excellent rendition of "Happy Birthday" as I sing even better than he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always believe what the Minister says because he never tells a lie. He stated that there was no level playing field under the new arrangements and that extra money would be given to assist schools that took grant-maintained status. I accept that. However, he said, too, that the new arrangements would not involve increased public expenditure. That is appalling; it means that the Government are deliberately striking at schools that wish to stay under LEA control. Is that fair and just and good governance? It most certainly is not. I urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude to the issue so that the schools that want to stay with local education authorities have a fair deal. As my hon. Friends said, the crucial central services, will be pared away. I am thinking not only of services such as the educational psychologist, but of what used to be called the school bobby, which we will discuss at greater length later. If we are to tackle absenteeism, which—I deny it not—is a serious problem in some schools, we must be serious about doing it. There is no evidence in the clause that the Secretary of State will compel the funding authorities to spend the money necessary for the social inquiries, the social reports and the time that teachers will need to take off to take people to court or to solve problems that people have at home.

I appeal to the Minister's good nature. I ask him to examine the clause again and realise that he wishes something democratic, not dictatorial. We would join him in redrafting the clause. Then we could all go home to our beds happy.
