	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned for dinner, I was saying that the format of the assessment of key stage 3 English will determine the strategy and type of teaching permitted in the classroom. I was about to illustrate that with reference to the teaching of Shakespeare. The Department for Education and the Government generally hold that Shakespeare, as an important part of our literary heritage, should be available to all students. In schools that I know, the assessment format adopted by the Government has forbidden or made less likely the teaching of Shakespeare to children who had been taught Shakespeare texts prior to its introduction. Not only is it almost forbidden by statute for lower-ability pupils to be taught Shakespeare, but the strategies that teachers need to adopt to teach Shakespeare successfully to the whole ability range—reading texts, but also watching films, undertaking co-operative work with other students and taking part in drama and discussion exercises—do not shape the format of testing proposed by the Government for key stage 3 English. Teachers were previously allowed to use such forms of assessment, which enabled them to do exactly what the Government are now encouraging them to do—teach a wide range of literature to the whole ability range. There is a no justification for the Government on the one hand to claim that they want to make all forms of literature available to all of our children and on the other to deny our teachers the strategies that they need to adopt to do so successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the assessment targets are not exclusive in that way. Just because teachers are not required to assess pupils in a particular way does not mean that they cannot put them in a theatrical situation so that they can appreciate the theatrical, as well as the literary and poetic, element of Shakespeare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The next time the hon. Gentleman visits his constituency, will he ask teachers teaching key stage 3 of the national curriculum how much spare time they have for elements outside the curriculum laid down in statute by the Government? The message has come loud and clear from teachers—there is barely time to teach the national
	<span class='label label-info column'>1306</span>
curriculum, let alone things that they would like to teach if they had the time. Under the format of testing for key stage 3 English, Shakespeare texts are not prescribed for lower-ability children, yet before that prescriptive outline of texts was issued Shakespeare was taught successfully to the whole ability range. That will no longer happen because the Government have decided not to include Shakespeare among the set texts and the structure of the assessment will not enable teachers to teach Shakespeare—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you Mr. Martin. I am sure that it was difficult for you to hear over the hullabaloo. The GCSE results published last year showed an increase in the standards of 16-year-old children. That told us many things. It reflected the hard work of teachers, parents and pupils, which resulted in significantly raising the standards of our children. It showed also that the strategies of teaching and assessment that we used in schools up to that time had played their part in raising the standard of literacy in England and Wales. When standards are clearly on an upturn, there is no justification—without consultation and in the face of opposition from teachers—to change the assessment arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister three sets of questions. First, will he explain which elements of the final tests, which will be introduced into schools in June, reflect the comments of those teachers who were involved in the pilot scheme of key stage 3? Where were the changes made? How was the final outcome influenced? Secondly, why has the school Examinations and Assessment Council sent the sample test questions for the English key stage 3 tests to chairmen of governors, but refused to make them available to schools for a further two or three weeks? Thirdly, on what evidence is he basing his change of assessment methodology? Does not he share our great joy at last summer's increased and improved exam results? How can he justify moving away from a form of assessment and freedom of teaching strategies for members of staff who have served our pupils well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Congdon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was tempted to intervene before we took our break for dinner because I have never heard such a load of rubbish from Opposition Members as I have heard about the clause. It re-enacts existing legislation, yet hon. Members have predictably used it as an opportunity to knock almost every aspect of current educational reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend that all aspects of the national curriculum and assessment procedures are perfect, but they have made a worthwhile change in education. Opposition Members might not like my next comment. Because of the sort of arguments used by them and their friends in the teacher unions, it is often impossible to take seriously some of their complaints about the national curriculum and the assessment tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman believes that not everything is right with the national curriculum. We should be interested to hear with which aspects he is not happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is easy. The national curriculum rightly sets out a programme for schools to follow. In the 1980s, deliberate attempts were made by those in the educational establishment who did not like the programme to over-complicate it and to make it difficult for schools to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0829">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1307</span>
follow in all aspects. That relates especially to assessment testing. However, in many ways that is irrelevant. Opposition Members may look incredulous, but too many people in the educational establishment were determined to undermine those valuable reforms. They are on the statute book and are rightly and properly being implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, complaints were made about the Secretary of State not consulting properly with teachers. How can we take seriously the views of teacher unions when, instead of arguing for improvements to be made in the system, they still question the essential validity of assessment tests? That is why they have no credibility. When the Croydon teachers association writes to Members of Parliament to complain not about education but about the bombing of Iraq, it does its profession a grave disservice. We all welcome improvements in the GCSE results, although we must remember the HMI report that reviewed some of this summer's results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to the HMI's comments on England. The HMI in Wales said that it was satisfied with the way in which the Welsh Joint Education Committee maintained standards. Even in the English report, the criticisms were minor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear those comments about Wales. I was discussing England and I do not think that the HMI's criticisms were minor. It is impossible to believe that the percentage improvement in those youngsters who get more than five passes at GCSE compared with the results at O-level was due purely to improvements in standards. We must ensure that standards are an objective measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to hear the hon. Gentleman's definition of a pass. When I started teaching GCSE, I was told that there was no such thing as a pass or a fail, only grades that ranged from G to A, and that each one could be a satisfactory result for the individual concerned. We must move away from the idea of passing and failing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we need to get out of that way of thinking. It is right to recognise that different pupils will achieve different levels of performance, but the remarks of the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) are too often used by people who try deliberately to deceive parents about what is being achieved in schools. Parents are concerned about the number of passes—I used the word "passes" unashamedly—at A to C grades at GCSE.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is straying from the terms of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In conclusion, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris) should not be complacent because there is great concern throughout the country about standards, especially about reading in primary schools. That is why the standard assessment tests are so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Byers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly deals with the question of standards. Why did the Government, in 1989, abolish the only national body for monitoring standards—the Assessment of Performance Unit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1308</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Congdon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measurements of performance should be carried out at school level, by the governors and by the LEAs. An LEA worth its salt will do just that, but too many of them have abdicated their responsibility, which is why more and more schools will choose grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North, who suggested that there was no such thing as a pass or a fail. There is clearly failure. The hon. Member for Croydon, North-East (Mr. Congdon) has failed his pupils and his teachers in everything that he has just said. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend said, he has failed to recognise that there was a central way to determine standards, but it was heedlessly abolished by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Erewash (Mrs. Knight) so often complains about how local politicians poke their noses too far into what is professional business, but the Secretary of State pokes his nose into the national curriculum against all professional advice. That is a disgrace. I will not say that the Secretary of State is a learned gentleman, but he used to teach geography at Oxford. I recall the days when that geography department produced some jolly good Blues in rowing and rugby, although not a great many Firsts. Only the occasional lady took geography. The Secretary of State was well suited to lecturing in geography at Oxford because the people who really wanted to do a decent degree in that subject went elsewhere. Those who wanted to play and to do other things—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was a contemporary of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State when he taught geography. Although I was no geographer, I can assure the Committee that Hertford college had a reputation par excellence for geography.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall give a lesson in geography and remind the Committee that we are in the Palace of Westminster discussing clause 213. So far, I have heard nothing that relates to that clause. Perhaps at this late hour we can start discussing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Martin. It is disgraceful that Secretaries of State, or even toffs who are Ministers—this Minister is a toff and a gent if ever there was one—should be prescriptive with the national curriculum. They are going against all professional advice. As a result of their interference and over-prescription, which was admirably outlined by my hon. Friends, they are squeezing out some very important subjects. I make no apology for saying that classics is among the victims. It is almost a deliberate victim because it makes people think independently and demonstrates, through Aristotle and through Plato, who is much maligned by the Conservative party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. I would never malign Plato, which happens to be the name of my dog.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of Plato the dog would take me back to canine matters, which would take me back to Maastricht and thence off the subject of our debate, so I shall not pursue it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subjects are being squeezed out of the curriculum through over-prescription. I shall take for my text a letter written by the Secretary of State to his colleagues. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0830">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1309</span>
Committee will be pleased to know that he holds regular advice centres in Abingdon, Botley, Kennington and Oxford and his telephone number for consultation on education is 721508. The second paragraph of the letter states that the tests
	<br><blockquote><p>"have provided an objective measure of achievement and the publication of the results has been widely welcomed by parents and the wider community."</p></blockquote>
Let us consider the results of two Woodgreen secondary schools that are near the Secretary of State's constituency. He knows a great deal about them. The schools held two meetings for parents in December 1992 and January 1993. That shows support for parent power, of which the Government are so enamoured. I also support that; I have always insisted that parents should participate in their children's education. The meetings were held for year 9 and the schools had to explain the tests to parents. The meetings were not political; independent observers attended them. Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour supporters were there—although I did not receive my information from a Labour supporter. At both meetings parents demanded angrily that the tests must not be carried out this year. They did not ask the schools to boycott them; they asked them to treat them as a trial, not real tests. The parents were right. If the Secretary of State repeats something often enough, he believes it. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools discussed infallibility earlier. During Question Time today the Secretary of State made more infallible statements than the papacy has made in its entire existence—yet he is wrong. He claimed that the tests were the most tested tests of all time. He said that they were tried and true. However, the single system of examining in Latin, Greek and classical studies was more thoroughly tested than the shoddy nonsense that the Bill describes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask, out of curiosity, was not the papal doctrine of infallibility determined only in 1871?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's devotion to methodism is well known and his knowledge of history is better than mine. He is correct. He will recall that infallibility means assembling all the bishops from all the diocese. It means a gathering of everyone involved. That means LEAs, if we relate the doctrine to our proceedings, but that has not happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If governors and parents decide that they do not want the tests this year—which has happened frequently—the Government, contrary to their continual, stated desire to take into account parents' views, have done nothing. That is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come now to a strange paragraph relating to the National Union of Teachers. The Secretary of State has got it in for the NUT. I am a member of what is now the Association of Teachers and Lecturers—it used to be the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association—which is equally damning about the lack of preparation. The Secretary of State finds it more inconvenient to say rude things about ATL.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The criticism of the NUT was that it called for disruption and for interference with children's education and teacher training. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the ATL has not called for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite untrue. The NUT proposed that the set of tests should not be used as the definitive test, which is different from the attitude of what we know and love as AMMA. We must nail the lie. Teachers are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1310</span>
opposed to testing. I never was during my teaching career, and I was always in the mainstream of Labour policy on education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strange letter from the Secretary of State also stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, the tests have been subjected to the sort of rigorous and systematic preparation not previously experienced, even in long-established public examinations. They were prepared on the strength of over two years of trials in the classroom and a formal pilot sample of secondary schools last year. As a result, they will be among the most scrupulous"—notice the word "scrupulous"—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"ever produced and reflect very much the views and advice of teachers."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister name one association of teachers in England or one trade union or professional organisation—I do not count the Professional Association of Teachers—that says that it agrees with what has happened and the way in which it has happened? Those bodies are not against testing, taking samples or controlling the value and manner of teaching, but they greatly oppose the scrambled way in which that has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Claims about the lack of preparation are quite spurious and in many cases no doubt reflect the philosophical and political opposition to testing that is still rife among some teacher unions and their friends in the Labour party."</p></blockquote>
That is a disgrace. The Secretary of State's remarks to newspapers at the weekend, in which he suggested that there was a Marxist conspiracy to upset the tests, are scandalous and not worthy of a great Secretary of State—but then, he is not a great Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote the letter of a practising, hard-working and conscientious English teacher, who is determined to get the best for her pupils. She wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I don't mind testing. I am opposed to teaching children the National Curriculum then testing them on something else."</p></blockquote>
That is the slipshod way that it has been approached. She continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Patten has refused to speak to parents association representatives this week. Meeting with Oxfordshire heads last week, he issued an order in advance that they were forbidden to mention key stage 3 tests. This man is hiding as
<br><br><!-- lb -->
well as"—</p></blockquote>
I shall not repeat the next word as it would be unparliamentary. That is what a dedicated teacher thinks, as well she might.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to the illiterate letter that the Secretary of State sent us on 18 January. How could any teacher respect the Secretary of State's prescriptions when he considers that the plural of child is childrens? [HON. MEMBERS "Oh dear."] That is outrageous. If Conservative Members think that that is a minor peccadillo, then, goodness me, I pray for their souls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. Gentleman gets to his knees to pray for the souls of my hon. Friends—I am sure that their souls will benefit as the Conservative party is a broad church—I shall respond to some of his slightly episcopalian over-the-top expressions. I entirely trust my hon. Friend the Minister to respond to the debate, but some remarks now might counteract some of the absurdities that we have heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is usually a kindly and reasonable individual. Once or twice we discerned, through the mist of his oratory, a little common sense. If I can peer through the mist and find the common sense, I can agree on a couple of issues. I agree that we do not want a national
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0831">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1311</span>
curriculum that is over-prescriptive, to use his term. I agree that we do not want to lose the teaching of classics from the education system. I suggest that we were losing the teaching of classics long before the national curriculum was introduced. It has been a steady process in the post-war period. There must be other ways of protecting what he would like to see protected.

If there is over-prescription in the national curriculum, it does not appear in the Bill. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is way off target in suggesting that if we oppose the clause, we shall have any impact on the detail of the national curriculum. We can argue about the detail elsewhere and, no doubt, in the House on another occasion. However, the detail is not part of the clause. It will ensure that, under the national curriculum, standards in education continue to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Yardley said that standards have been rising. That may already be to the credit of the national curriculum. It certainly is to the credit of the Government's education policy. Standards, which were previously slipping, have been rescued to some extent by the national curriculum, not least by the core subjects and the way in which they are taught.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman square what he has said about the rise in standards with the Government's condemnation of GCSE standards this year and the remarks of the hon. Member for Croydon, North-East who decried those standards? In addition, the HMI report stated that it could see no discernible impact of the national curriculum in improving standards in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was quoting the hon. Member for Yardley who said that she had perceived improved standards. I perceive some improvements as a result of the national curriculum. That is not to say that everything is perfect and that we should not constantly monitor it in order to improve matters still further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is normally sensitive and intelligent, but this time he has gone a little over the top and is not being as analytical as he should be. Does he not agree that, since we have moved in a short time from a multiplicity of testing—CSE, GCSE and a whole variety of board examinations—to a single system of examination and certification, the increase in standards that has been achieved by a dedicated teaching work force has become clearer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can certainly see that there is some improvement. The hon. Gentleman knows that it is difficult to compare GCEs and CSEs with GCSEs in terms of defined results. We must ensure always that the end product of the testing and examination system is an improvement in school education. Testing has to be part of the national curriculum. The hon. Gentleman was honest enough to say that he accepted testing and the national curriculum, but too many Opposition Members do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Hall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warrington, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about an improvement in standards. That improvement has less to do with the national curriculum than with the merger of the GCE and CSE examinations into the GCSE, of which continuous assessment is an important element. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Labour Members have always
	<span class='label label-info column'>1312</span>
supported the concept of testing, although we have favoured diagnostic, criterion-referenced assessment over the Government's preference for testing against the norm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now claims to support testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The hon. Member for Battersea says that we now claim to support testing. We have always supported diagnostic testing and assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a matter for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was trying to mislead the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. He was certainly not trying to mislead the Committee. No hon. Member would try to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that defence of me, Mr. Martin. I shall use it on another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Testing and the publication of results play an important part in convincing parents of the value of the education system. Reference has been made to key stage 3. The arguments in the education world have not been about whether key stage 3 should take place, or even whether it should take place this year, so much as whether the results this year should be published or whether this year should be considered to be the first year of a new system. That is how teachers describe the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not very concerned about the publication of results. I would be in favour of the publication of a whole range of material. However, if results are to be published, why do the Secretary of State and his Minister refuse to publish their results at O-level and A-level, as reported in today's edition of 	<i>The Guardian?</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any intention to publish any individual's results. The publication of the results of a class is very different from the publication of an individual's results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Testing and the publication of results are important. The good news is that the results that have been published show some progress. For example, 75 per cent. of seven-year-olds have met the core subject target. I cannot understand why Opposition Members resent and resist the continuation, improvement, expansion and development of the national curriculum. I ask them to cast their minds back to the Committee considering the Education Reform Bill, on which many of us served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national curriculum was introduced without bitter opposition from the Labour party, partly because its then education spokesman, the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), had to confess that in his dim and distant past he had written pamphlets advocating a national curriculum. That is the origins of the debate on the national curriculum and it is a pity that on this, as on many other areas of education policy, the Labour party is turning its back on progress and good sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a long and wide-ranging debate. I noted references by the hon. Member for Bath of the need for a complete rejig of the standard spending assessment for local authority expenditure on education. In the middle of the debate the hon. Member for Hemsworth made a blatant, misconceived and elitist
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0832">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1313</span>
attack on my absent colleague. The hon. Gentleman and I share a background in the classics, and I found it unworthy of him to launch an attack on geography, not least because it is clear that the Labour party has clearly lost its way and needs a good map.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make it clear that I was not attacking geography, but the geography course at Oxford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful and I stand corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an interesting day. The hon. Member for Dewsbury confirmed this morning that she would return grant-maintained schools to the local authority sector. In tonight's debate the Labour party has acknowledged that for all its protestations of support for the national curriculum and its alleged support for some sort of testing, when it comes down to it Opposition Members always find so many exceptions to whatever is proposed that their support disappears and amounts to nothing. Their attitude is like that of certain people to sin—they are utterly against it, but they always find reasons for not doing anything about it. That came over very clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1945 Churchill was comforted by his wife when he lost the election. She said to him that it could be a blessing in disguise and he replied that it was pretty effectively disguised. I take the same view of Labour Members' support for the national curriculum in the light of this debate. They are all for it in theory, but absolutely against it in practice when we seek, through our agents and advisers, to implement it. I find that rather sad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also clear to me from the debate that whereas standards are rising—as shown particularly by the tests for seven-year-olds—relevance and application to the subject has not improved. It is regrettable that that comes from classics graduates and other experienced and professional people on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case anyone has forgotten, this clause is not about those matters, except in a general sense. The late Frankie Howerd, much beloved by many members of the Committee, used to say, "We must get back to the prologue". He would then be sidetracked by some intervention, usually from a pretty young woman, and never get round to explaining the prologue. Perhaps I should remind the Committee that clause 213 contains technical amendments to the Education Reform Act 1988, the sense and application of which I freely concede are not immediately obvious to the casual reader.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes technical amendments to the 1988 Act to improve and clarify the operation of the assessment arrangements. First, it empowers the Secretary of State to specify arrangements for auditing and verifying marking standards as part of the assessment. Secondly, it puts on head teachers, governing bodies and LEAs such specific duties as are necessary for the effective implementation of assessment and assessment of audit arrangements. Thirdly, it establishes that children taught in classes where no one age group is in the majority should be assessed according to their actual age. Fourthly, it puts the definition of the school year on a clear footing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, a series of amendments set out in subsection (4) refer specifically to the national curriculum. Everything that we have heard this evening relates to key
	<span class='label label-info column'>1314</span>
stage 3, but the Bill deals with key stage 4. The debate has been generously permitted to stray from the narrow subject matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McAvoy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A vicious attack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make no apologies for that. If I wish to be vicious, the hon. Gentleman will have to wait a little longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the nature of the Opposition's comments and the substance of the case that they put forward, there is something remarkably familiar. They may not be relevant, but in one sense they are entirely predictable. We have heard this before in the past few months and we have heard it again this afternoon. If we so choose, we will hear it again and again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the Minister recognises the relevance of what we are saying. This is the theory being laid down by the Minister and "by their fruits ye shall know them." We have merely expatiated on the Government's fruits so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fine, perhaps that will move us further forward. It is difficult to accept Opposition Members' criticism when they play both ends against the middle. That may be the role of an opposition—it has been happening today. On the one hand, we are told that the tests are too prescriptive, but on the other that they might be unclear. We are told that the Government and the tests are too subject to change, but at the same time that the Government have a narrow mind. Whatever we do, we are damned for introducing the tests because they confine, but when we change them, listen to advice or respond to the views of teachers and try to reflect them in our arrangements, that does not suit either. That may be a way of conducting opposition, but it is not a good recipe for the advancement of good government or effective testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful to the Committee if I explain what we are doing in the tests, particularly in the key stage 3 for English. When we started, I assumed, wrongly, that the principle of the national curriculum was widely accepted—though clearly not by Opposition Members. We want it in place to ensure that pupils no longer lose out on the fundamental skills, knowledge and understanding needed for all aspects of their adult life. It looks forward to what they will be doing in a few years' time and provides them with the necessary equipment for that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have closed minds and are prepared to keep the national curriculum under review. Certain arrangements were changed in the past and we are ready to improve the assessment and testing arrangements. If the Committee permits us to debate it, we shall shortly deal with clause 214 which is precisely designed to improve the machinery for doing so. We were told that we had changed nothing, but in relation to maths and science we have made changes in the light of teachers' experience. We are now considering English and technology and teachers' experience is invaluable in that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why have the Government broadened that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying, as are many of his hon. Friends, that there must be an absolute unity of view between all professional individuals before we can proceed, that is a recipe for not proceeding with anything. I do not believe that we can wait for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government take no notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that we take no notice, but perhaps he will listen to what we have done in relation to the tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever else may be relevant to the matter, the tests for seven-year-olds are perhaps less relevant, but we took advice and simplified the tests used in 1991 for that group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because they were chaotic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the 1992 tests were considerably better?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the Opposition have produced no model of the type of tests that they want. They are good at rubbishing the tests that we produce but we did not invent them until we had taken advice. If the Opposition were to produce their model we could assess, test and put it to teachers and parents and then, perhaps, I would have more respect for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A clear model is widely accepted by teachers, parents and governors in England and Wales and it has been adopted in Scotland. That is the model that most people south of the border would wish the Government to adopt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says but I do not believe that English conditions would deliver the quality of testing and assurance to parents that we seek. The hon. Gentleman merely wants to reproduce the Scottish model without telling us about its substance as opposed to how it is implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unbelievable that the Minister requires me to tell him about the system of testing in Scotland. He has been told about it by every parent-teacher and teacher association and by the National Association of Governors and Managers. However, if he would like me to send him a brief on the matter I shall be happy to do so if that means that there is a possibility that he will listen to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may correspond if he wishes because we are interested in receiving representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the key stage 2 tests for 11-year-olds. This year we are introducing pilot tests in English, maths and science for that group and 2 per cent. of schools are being covered, though other schools may join in. The SEAC will ask for teachers' views on the tests, which will pave the way for the first national tests in 1994 for 11-year-olds and build on the lessons that we have learnt. That is directly relevant to the key stage 3 tests for 14-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have conducted pilot tests in English, maths and science for two and a half years. The development of the English test started in 1990. There were 6,500 pupils involved in that year, 22,000 in 1991 and 13,000 last year. Others have been involved in the pre-testing of different test models in order to arrive at a model that we regard as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those trials were conducted to discover whether the tests accurately differentiated pupils by ability. Of course, that testing was necessary to ensure that the format of the papers and the individual test items would work, but what happened? Some people irresponsibly thought that it was appropriate or clever to leak those test questions to the press. The result is that SEAC is now obliged to draw up new questions at some expense, but they will be based on the model that has been developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1316</span>
That has not been done without the advice or interest of English teachers. Many hundreds of teachers have been involved and their views have counted. A test panel under SEAC has been set up to oversee the tests and includes both serving and former teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to claim that those arrangements are perfect, but they have been worked out over time with considerable care and it would be unwise to throw them away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister glossed over the fact that English teachers are on the panel that oversees the tests. Is it not true that one of the panel members was refused permission to go to one of the schools where trials were taking place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will always be people who take exception to particular things that are done, and I am not surprised by that, as I have some knowledge of the academic world. In my view the tests were comprehensive, reasonable and properly conceived. I shall invite the Committee to respond to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To draw some conclusions from our discussion, there are three levels of concern about testing, which understandably, have been confused. One is the concern of some English teachers, either because of the course work issue, which is separate and has not been mentioned directly, or because of their professional concerns. Some of those have been fed into the system, but teachers may feel that others have not been fully reflected in the arrangements. We shall continue to listen to their concerns, especially in the light of the test outcome later this summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second group of people are those who try to build on teachers' concerns for political reasons. Some but by no means all of those are in the Labour party. I still await a clear account of the Labour party's model and proposals. Finally, a different and less commendable bunch is involved in a campaign that has nothing to do with English tests for 14-year-olds. It goes much further and substantially seeks to overturn the basis of assessment and testing on the grounds that we should return to the secret garden in which nothing was assessed or tested and nothing had any value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dare say the Minister has received a letter from a school in my city, Plymouth high school for girls, which refers to the tests and the English anthology. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The texts that have been chosen are of the sort once considered appropriate for O and A Level candidates. Most of them are not suited to the interests and aptitudes of Year 9 students, even in a selective school such as our own."</p></blockquote>
Even a selective school criticises the choice of the anthology. What does the Minister say to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly not give an instant reaction to a particular letter, but it is interesting that the hon. Member for Yardley complained that the new arrangements would give fewer opportunities for the teaching of Shakespeare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third element in the bandwaggon of alleged concern is much more directly politically oriented, does not always operate through the Labour party and possibly involves one or two professional organisations for the teaching of English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I vowed that I would not interrupt the Minister again, but such outrageous nonsense cannot be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0834">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1317</span>
allowed to pass without comment. Can he explain what connection independent schools, which are boycotting the examinations, have with Marxism, Terry Eagleton or anybody else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has mentioned a name that I might have mentioned myself. It may be difficult for some members of the Labour party to follow this, but I have been at pains to say that there are a number of people who have different concerns. I am aware of people in the independent sector who take the views that I outlined. Many may have professional reservations; I do not say that they do not. However, I do say that some people in the associations do not have a fundamental commitment to standards, values and quality in education. They are relativists, as will be evinced in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the most disgraceful slur on this nation's teaching profession—which is doing its utmost, in the most difficult circumstances, to raise standards of education in schools. Teachers have properly criticised key stage 3 English, having been invited to do so by the Minister's Department. Who does the Minister think has been implementing the Government's education policy for the past 14 years? Only when teachers criticise Government policy, as they are doing now, does the Minister turn on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Lady acknowledges that the Department is prepared to listen to such representations. Some people in the coalition of resentment of or opposition to tests include those whose commitment to academic values is not that of the hon. Lady. She spoke in favour of the teaching of Shakespeare and I hope that every member of the Committee shares her view. I do not know whether she would agree with the person quoted who said that he regarded Shakespeare as "achingly boring". In fact, the expression "achingly boring" was qualified by reference to a particular piece of the anatomy, which I shall not repeat. To judge by the quality of the debate and its relevance to the clause, some members of the Committee may find clause 213 achingly boring, but that is not necessarily their view of Shakespeare. It is the familiar and, perhaps, unappealing cocktail of first, the genuine anxieties of professional teachers who are confronting a new situation and a new panel of testing, and secondly, of many people who have a completely different political agenda because they are not in the least interested in testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When all the huffing and puffing is done, it is evident that the national curriculum has, for the first time, established clear national standards for the teaching and learning of each subject prescribed. It is proving a powerful force in improving the quality of education in schools—not overnight, as there are no instant results, but there is an inexorable move towards progress in educational standards. The associated assessment arrangements are not bolt-ons to that process; they are integral to its successful implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 213 is necessary if the national curriculum tests and examinations are to be administered smoothly. The amendments that it makes to the Education Reform Act 1988 will strengthen the credibility of the results of assessment and ensure that standards apply consistently. We shall consider whether the results of those tests can be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1318</span>
improved in subsequent years, but we cannot sit about, for ever picking over the nits of this set of tests. They are firmly on the right lines and I support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 966, in page 125, line 36, at end insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The case for the amendment was made in what the Minister said earlier. If he has proved one thing, it is that the people who are responsible for the national curriculum and the present methods of testing so much share the views of Ministers that provision should be made to ensure that the curriculum and testing procedures are more professionally based and more appropriate for the needs of our children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 214 amalgamates the NCC and SEAC. It is interesting to recall the origins of those two bodies in 1988. The Labour party proposed then that the two bodies should be amalgamated. It is strange to see our policy of four years ago being written into this Bill. That policy was, of course, rubbished by Ministers. During those four years they spent a considerable amount of money establishing one of those bodies in York, a couple of hundred miles from London, and disrupted the lives of people who had to move to York. I should be interested to discover how much public expenditure was caused by the Government's original mistake. However, the Opposition will support clause 214, given that we suggested its provisions four years ago.

Amendment No. 965 would require membership of the proposed school curriculum and assessment authority to be ratified by members of the Select Committee on Education. Much good work has been done recently by various Select Committees, proving that they would have an important role to play in parliamentary scrutiny. The amendment would improve demographic accountability in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also expresses many people's concern at the somewhat narrow views held by the two bodies at the present time. The most recent criticism was made by Peter Harding, a member of the committee appointed to advise SEAC on English testing. Mr. Harding, head of English at an opted-out grammar school, joined that committee last year. Although I do not know him personally, he hardly fits the Minister's implied belief that any critic of the Government is a wicked left-winger. He had his eyes opened very quickly when he joined the committee. He came to the conclusion that
	<br><blockquote><p>"SEAC is an extremely political organisation, dominated by those whose sympathies lie with the Centre for Policy Studies".</p></blockquote>
The other day, a letter was sent to me by accident. It was a copy of a letter sent to a Conservative Member of Parliament. It contained phrases such as, "Don't you think your education policy is going a bit too far? Have you considered what might happen after the next election if there is a Labour Secretary of State for Education, who could then use all the powers that the Secretary of State will have?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter said that a Labour Secretary of State would pack the committees with placemen. He would give a different, wicked, socialist prescription to the curriculum. The letter warned of the dangers that would arise if the Secretary of State were given so many powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be checks and balances in our system. A Secretary of State—Labour or Conservative—should not have so much power without any checks and balances. One check should be the difference between the power that goes to local authorities and the power that goes to central Government. We must use the checks and balances of our democratic system to avoid the inevitable criticism when Secretaries of State abuse their power by appointing like-minded nominees, which result in a narrow range of opinion on important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ratification by the Committee of membership of such a body would improve democratic accountability and ensure that decisions made in such vital areas had the confidence of everyone in the country. I hope that hon. Members—perhaps not Conservative Members, who often seem to have closed minds—will support the amendment, which would be a significant step in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's general point was that her proposals of four years ago—when circumstances were slightly different and when the National Curriculum Council had so much to do—have come to fruition in the merger of the two bodies into the SCAA. If it makes her happy to feel that she can claim some paternity, or whatever—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sexist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1320</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I qualified my remark. If the hon. Lady wants to claim responsibility, I am happy to concede that. It is the appropriate thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not chase people with particular philosophies to serve on the body. I remind the Committee that when we discussed the previous amendment I did not say that I regarded anybody who disagreed with key stage 3 English testing as a dangerous left-winger. Nor do I wish to imply that there is a narrow political handle in the professional bodies; there is not. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will select the most appropriate and suitable people for the new appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask the Committee to pause for a moment and then to reject the hon. Lady's amendment. She seeks—in what apears to be a rather small amendment being debated at a latish hour of the evening—to introduce a novel and, in my view, a fundamentally destructive principle into our arrangements. She wants—possibly because President Clinton has recently won the election in America—to embody in the Bill part of the American constitution. She is proposing that a Select Committee ratifies the appointment of individual members of non-departmental bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have suddenly developed an enthusiasm for such proposals. Our essential difference from the American constitution is that, in this country, the Executive is also part of the House of Commons. This afternoon's Question Time showed, to my reasonable satisfaction, that it is possible for all hon. Members to question members of the Executive about their policies and ministerial responsibilities. It is possible also for people to question the Secretary of State about future appointments to the authority. The hon. Lady wants to introduce an American concept that is appropriate only for a system in which the Executive is divorced from the legislature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would set a dangerous precedent and should be judged on its merits. I ask the Committee to resist it. In making appointments, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will ensure that a wide range of backgrounds is represented. I am confident that he is the right person to make those choices, which can be properly tested through questions to Ministers in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's remark that the Secretary of State will appoint people with a wide range of backgrounds and that the right hon. Gentleman is just the right person to make the appointments has convinced me that we were right to table the amendment. The hon. Gentleman's reference to Clinton and recent conversions showed that he has not done his homework properly; we have tabled similar amendments to other Bills, so we are not departing from policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that it is fundamentally destructive of our constitution to have scrutiny by a House of Commons Select Committee shows how touchy the Minister is. While he is right to say that there is something called Question Time in the House of Commons, he is not right to say that our questions are answered. Ministers give us replies, but they rarely give us answers. It is clear that the amendment would be a significant step forward and I urge the Committee to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The acoustics in the building are not as good as I had thought. I was only in the loo, but I did not hear the Division being called. The Government Whip saw where I went.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As they say, it goes with the territory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are an attempt to deal with the same sort of issue as that dealt with by the previous set. However, they do so in a very different way. Unlike the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Dewsbury, which the Minister described as radical—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The noise is terrible. It is unfair. Hon. Members should be heard when they address the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Mr. Martin. While the previous set of amendments were described by the Minister as radical and posing constitutional problems, I am sure that he will have considered my amendments carefully and realised that they pursue a course that the Government have followed in previous legislation. The wording of the amendments is, in the main, drawn from recent legislation, so I will be interested in the Minister's response to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we discussing both amendments Nos. 920 and 921?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am moving amendment No. 920, and amendment No. 921 has been grouped with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is based on wording taken from earlier legislation, but I accept that it goes further than that. It has four main aims. First, it is intended to help secure an educational, rather than a political, chairman of the new body. That would be provided for by the requirement for educational experience in new subsection (4). Secondly, it would improve the calibre of appointees' educational experience. That would be achieved by the words "shown capacity in" in new paragraph (4A)(a). Thirdly, it would provide places in the new authority for practising teachers. That would be achieved by the words "currently engaged" in new paragraph (4A)(b). Fourthly—and I admit a motive that I hope will have some resonance for all members of the Committee—the amendment aims to provide a link between the membership of the new authority and further education and vocational qualifications. That is covered by new paragraph (4A)(c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to save time later this evening, Mr. Martin, perhaps you will permit me to make a passing reference to a further series of amendments that I have tabled—Nos. 930 and 931 to clause 215. Members of the Committee who have considered them will know that it is my clear intention to ensure that the authority will be involved with vocational qualifications for school-age children. In reply to the previous debate, the Minister said that he wanted a national curriculum that would enable pupils to gain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0837">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1323</span>
knowledge and understanding of all aspects needed for their adult life. I am sure that he will agree that that must include not only academic, but vocational work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee have expressed a desire to give equality of esteem and parity to academic and vocational qualifications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify the hon. Gentleman's intentions. Will he explain why he chose in amendment No. 920 to include in new subsection (4A)(b) the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard to the desirability"</p></blockquote>
but in (4A)(a) the words "shall include". What are we meant to read into the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is hardly difficult. In one case, it is of paramount importance that they "shall" be included, but in the other I am offering the Secretary of State some flexibility in determining membership. The hon. Gentleman's intervention is not really helpful because the words are fairly clear and they follow the convention used in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise if I am not making my point well, but the crucial issue is that the new authority should be involved in vocational work. That is covered by later amendments. It explains why the third and fourth purposes of the amendment have been included. I said earlier that the wording had been chosen from the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, which set up the Further Education Funding Council. Although that council has, in the main, financial functions, it also has a quality assurance role. Clearly, the authority to be set up by the Bill will also have quality assurance functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In specifying the membership of the Further Education Funding Council, the Committee and the House placed the same detailed wording in that Act that I am proposing for the Bill. It is reasonable to set out some specifications for membership while, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) pointed out, leaving the Secretary of State with some flexibility so that he can create a balance on the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will deal with the relationship between the new authority and work on vocational qualifications. I emphasise that point. He will be aware that the National Council for Vocational Qualifications was set up in 1986 with a brief to
	<br><blockquote><p>"promote, develop, implement and monitor a comprehensive system of vocational qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland".</p></blockquote>
That council is sponsored by the Department of Employment, the Department for Education and the Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices. It should be within the scope of the new authority to possess functions relating to vocational qualifications appropriate to students aged 11 to 19. That provision should be included in the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with the question of vocational qualifications when we debate the specific amendment. We attach considerable importance to the attainment of vocational qualifications and we are anxious that the right arrangements are in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the principle of the hon. Gentleman's proposal, he seeks to specify rather more precisely—to flesh out—the provision that we made in general terms in subsection (4), namely, that the Secretary of State should include persons
	<span class='label label-info column'>1324</span>
with knowledge of or experience in education among the members of the authority. We prefer to leave that general formulation, but his amendment specifies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the words of Luis de Leon on resuming his lecture at Salamanca university at the end of the middle ages after an interruption of five years' imprisonment by the Inquisition:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As we were saying yesterday."</p></blockquote>
I shall do my best to pick up the threads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) to consider holding over his amendment on vocational aspects for more precise examination later. Paragraph (b) of amendment No. 920 refers to people in
	<div class='ul'>	<li>"(i) primary education,</li>
	<li>(ii) secondary education, or</li>
	<li>(iii) further education suitable to the requirements of persons over compulsory school age".</li>
</div> <!-- ul -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, that wording is familiar, and those are exactly the type of people whom we might wish to appoint to the new body. However, we are anxious not to be overly prescriptive. As we have discussed ad nauseam today, other skills might also be required on occasions. I assure the Committee that experience and competence in education will be an important part of our quest. Therefore, our consideration is purely technical and relates to whether we should include precise specifications in the Bill or leave a margin of flexibility in making the appointments. For the reasons that I developed earlier, I advise the Committee to reject the amendments but to take note of my reassurances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the fact that in my earlier remarks I tried desperately to combine the vocational issue and the issue of membership. I did so mainly because I was aware of the pressure of time. Confining my remarks now to membership, I must say that I find it strange that in 1988 the Government saw fit to pass legislation that did not include details on membership. In 1992 they thought that it was a good idea and put it forward in legislation. However, a year later, they are unwilling to do so. Nevertheless, having had some assurances from the Minister about the membership of the new body I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

An interesting pattern has developed. The Minister wishes to be a statesman in the morning—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall not go into the outrageous but interesting possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for Ministers to claim that they want more and more powers to be exerted without parliamentary scrutiny or accountability. The Secretary of State should not be able to determine the structure of the operation after the event and without further consultation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To respond briefly, it may be appropriate at some stage to appoint a full-time executive chairman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he will present detailed proposals.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 846, in page 181, line 24, at end insert—

	<span class='label label-info column'>1326</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is specific but it is important to those people who are presently employed by the National Curriculum Council and the School Examinations and Assessment Council. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that protection is offered to those people. We will listen to the Minister with considerable interest because we want to know how the Government intend to protect their position. I should remind the Committee that it is only about five years since those two bodies were set up. The people who work for the NCC and the SEAC either changed their employment when those bodies were formed or have been taken on since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's track record on education does not inspire great confidence. At the time those two bodies were set up one of the issues that came to a head was the power of the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker), which he used to declare redundant at least three members of the former Secondary Examinations Council. It is important for the Committee to pay some heed to what took place at that time. The then Secretary of State said in a letter to those three people—they eventually resigned—that he was
	<br><blockquote><p>"satisfied you are well suited to the post that you have been offered by SEAC and are capable of giving excellent service".</p></blockquote>
They may have been capable of giving excellent service and they may have been suitable for those appointments, but the jobs that they were offered in the successor council were very different from their previous posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Mr. Paul Scruton had been employed to look after GCSE and A-level maths at the SEC but was transferred to a job that would have included setting up assessment schemes for seven-year-olds. The Minister is conferring with others. Perhaps I shall be able to make my point when his attention is riveted upon matters more domestic, such as the progress of this Committee. There is a world of difference between a job as a specialist on GCSE and A-level maths and a job that includes setting up assessment schemes for seven-year-olds. Mr. Scruton was so aggrieved by the new post that he felt that he had to resign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Patricia Wilson was a specialist in geography, geology and botany at A-level. She was offered a job that would have included work on science tests for seven-year-olds and in-service training for primary teachers. That is a different branch of education. Mrs. Frances Browne, who had been the personal assistant to the SEC's chief executive, resigned when she was offered a job at a lower grade because she felt that that was, de facto, a demotion, and I have sympathy with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the present bodies were established, the concept of comparability of work was nonsense. Yet the then Secretary of State told those people that he was satisfied that those were suitable new posts. He used his power to transfer those employees, with the result that they resigned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this present round of change it is incumbent on the Minister to satisfy the Committee that only if people are capable of and suitable for the work of the new body should they be offered appointments. New jobs should be comparable with previous work, otherwise such appointments are not acceptable. The Minister has insisted twice this evening that the Secretary of State is accountable through Parliament, but there is no accountability to Parliament or society generally for the abuse of powers that we saw four or five years ago by the then Secretary of

State for Education. I wait with considerable interest to see how he addresses the issue of comparability and whether people will be made redundant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the lessons learnt from past transfers, but the amendment does not invite staff to apply for any post. It suggests that the jobs should be offered to any member of staff, irrespective of their suitability to a particular job. I accept what he says about the better match within this than the experience that he is citing. But this goes too far in tying jobs to people who are not suitable for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will bear with me because I want to come to that. I do not know whether, in the meantime, I am allowed to spend my time meaningfully. It seems a shame to waste an opportunity to make the limited number of points that I wish to make sitting on a part of the anatomy that I will not mention for the sake of decency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by the hon. Gentleman is important. Ther kernel of the amendment and the centre of our concerns about the new council, is that there is no guarantee that those who presently work in the two existing bodies will be offered any employment at all in the new body. That is a harsh abuse of people who currently spend their productive hours in the service of the present council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In today's debate in the Chamber on the privatisation of the railways, the Secretary of State for Transport said that any would-be franchise holder of any part of the railway system will have to offer security of employment to those presently working on the railways. That is the position of a responsible Secretary of State. But this Bill does not offer that. The Secretary of State does not even seem to believe that it is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful to the Committee if I shared an exchange of correspondence which took place between the Secretary of State and the chairman of the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council. On 27 July, the Secretary of State wrote to Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No relation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend points out, he is no relation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to the SCAA, the Secretary of State, in his letter of 27 July, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In general the new body will be expected to fill its posts by open competition …".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will register that point. The Secretary of State said there would be no protection for existing employees. He went on to say that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… where staff of the existing Councils are engaged in work which will continue to be necessary to the discharge of the functions of the new Authority or the new Authority in Wales … it may be appropriate for them to be preferred by the new body".</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State magnanimously does not rule out the employment of some, but he makes it clear that, in general, the new body will be expected to fill its posts by open competition, so those who currently work in the predecessor councils have had it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of the Bill implementing the Government's plans will be that:</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1328</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>a. staff who are offered and accept posts at the SCAA should have continuity of employment;"—</p></blockquote>
that is very nice—
	<br><blockquote><p>"b. staff who are offered, but decline, equivalent posts at the SCAA will not be eligible for redundancy compensation unless the offer imposes a requirement for relocation which is outside the terms of their contract of employment."</p></blockquote>
In other words, those who are offered a post which does not compare with that which they currently occupy will not be able to claim redundancy. That is a disgrace because it is an arbitrary abrogation of people's contractual position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point about redundancy has nothing to do with the amendment, but I accept that the hon. Gentleman is using this occasion to raise it. His amendment does not say that there should be a closed period when people from the two existing organisations could apply for a post that was advertised even if they did not have the right qualifications for it. The amendment says that they must be offered the post. That could be a case of reductio ad absurdum if two people were occupying equal posts and only one post in the new organisation was advertised. Under the terms of the amendment, it would have to be offered to both and, indeed, both would have to be employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying that he accepts the substance of my argument and can persuade the Minister that preference should be given to existing employees, that will satisfy the Opposition. However, that is not the Government's stated position at present. The Secretary of State has a much more bullying attitude because he makes it clear that he believes that no consideration should be given to existing staff. He says that they should be got rid of without redundancy if they refuse employment in a post that is significantly different from their existing employment. His letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In general the new body will be expected to fill its posts by open competition".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In his reply, Lord Griffiths wrote:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In your letter of 27 July, you stated that 'in general the new body will be expected to fill its posts by open competition'. The Council's advice is that initial ring-fencing of posts in the new body to staff currently on the same grades in SEAC and NCC is advisable, although with no obligation to appoint if suitable candidates are not found."</p></blockquote>
The clear advice of Lord Griffiths, the current chairman of one of the two bodies, is that there should be ring fencing of existing staff. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a procedure is likely to prevent loss of valuable staff from the two Councils, to facilitate an earlier start for the new body and to safeguard the delivery of National Curriculum Assessment, quality audit, new GCSE syllabuses and A/AS level subject cores."</p></blockquote>
He argues that there is a strong educational reason for retaining existing staff as a general rule, to be broken only in exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply to that letter, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On recruitment, there is again a balance to be struck. We would want to give the new body the flexibility to recruit according to the new challenges which face it, yet the new management will need to be satisfied that essential experience and expertise are not lost in the process."</p></blockquote>
That may seem to be more gentle in tone, but the letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department will be suggesting some more detailed discussions on this point: I hope you will be willing to take part."</p></blockquote>
That letter was written on 5 October, so I hope that the Minister can tell us the results of those deliberations. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0840">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1329</span>
trust that he can satisfy Opposition members of the Committee that the Government accept that, in the interests of continuity of employment and the educational needs of the new body, there must be ring fencing of the jobs of those employed by the new body along the lines suggested by Lord Griffiths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be a little unfair to dwell on it but, ironically, the Minister of State, Welsh Office, favours ring fencing. In a letter to Lord Griffiths on 24 July 1992 the right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There will of course be fundamental changes needed in the management and staffing needs of the extended Council. Provision will be made as appropriate for the transfer to the Council of staff and other resources from SCAA and the PDAG."</p></blockquote>
I quote the Minister's words as I am happy with his approach. The assumption was that a transfer of staff would take place as the normal mechanism, not, as the hon. Member for Battersea said, as an over-restrictive imposition on those proceedings but as the norm. That would be in the interests of those who have given service as it would offer them continuity. There are also good, sound educational reasons for such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contrast the civilised, sensible view of the Welsh Office, which we expect from the right hon. Gentleman, with the less pleasant attitude of the Secretary of State who is much more dogmatic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between England and Wales is that in Wales we have been dependent upon SEAC. I take this occasion to thank SEAC warmly for the work that it does. When the Bill is enacted, much of that work will be transferred to the Curriculum Council for Wales which will become the curriculum and assessment council for Wales. It will be a considerable enlargement of that body's responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. On behalf of the Opposition, I support his warm thanks for SEAC's work. The right hon. Gentleman acknowledged that work by saying that he would staff the new curriculum and assessment council for Wales largely with those who had previously provided such a service and we welcome that. The same sensible approach would be equally welcome from Ministers at the Department of Education. It is most unfair that, in circumstances that are tantamount to a transfer of undertakings, the English education system wants so casually to dismiss the work of the staff of the NCC and SEAC in the past five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one of his letters, the Secretary of State referred to the continuity of the terms of employment of those who will work for the new authority. Does that mean that those who work for the new authority will be employed on existing terms and conditions as civil servants or will there be an attempt in the future to erode those terms and conditions? It is of considerable importance to those who continue to work there that that issue is resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A closely allied question concerns the timing of the establishment of the new authority. The Bill makes it clear that the two existing councils will disappear immediately. Everyone with an interest in education and especially employees of those bodies wants to know when the new authority will come into being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On redundancy and open competition, do the Government accept Lord Grifiiths's recommendation that there should be some kind of ring fencing for those who are employed by the two councils? That would greatly ease
	<span class='label label-info column'>1330</span>
the Opposition's concerns. I hope that the hon. Member for Battersea, who seemed to be sympathetic to our views, will nod in the direction of the Minister to signify that he too accepts the merit of such ring fencing and that it would be unjust if open competition wiped out the careers of people who have served on the bodies so warmly commended by the Minister at the Welsh Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said and I will say again that if someone working for the existing bodies is good, he should, if possible, be employed in the new post that is comparable with his previous job. I would not say, as the amendment suggests, that every vacancy should be offered automatically as a gift to every employee of the two existing councils. Neither of those statements is the same as saying that no one who works for the existing bodies should be eligible, or that the new posts should be closed to those people. If they have merit, they should be appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Gentleman's earlier bravado has deserted him as he states the Government's position. He seems to have retreated from what he said earlier, but I shall not claim to speak for him or to vote for him, because I know how he will vote when the crunch comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister can achieve a consensual solution if he follows the Welsh Office and accepts Lord Grifiiths's suggestion of ring fencing. I hope that he will tell the Committee that the further deliberations to which the Secretary of State referred allow a consensual approach. If not, the new authority will start off with bad blood and the Minister and his colleagues will betray those who have given service to the bodies to whose worth one of his colleagues paid tribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) is right to say, as he always does, that employment and redundancy are sensitive matters. I hope that the Committee will approach them in the light of the discussion so far. I advise the Committee, however, that I cannot accept the amendment and I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to join me in rejecting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea rightly smoked out in his interventions the effect of the hon. Gentleman's two amendments taken together would be to ensure that all posts in the SCAA were offered to the staff of the existing bodies before being advertised externally. There would be a right of pre-emption or pre-transfer. For reasons that I shall explain to the Committee, we cannot accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman drew an analogy with the railways, but that is not a precise analogy because the purpose of the proposals being considered in the Chamber today is to transfer the operation of railways to another operator, whereas the Bill creates a new body and closes down two existing bodies. That is not a comparable situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh Office assisted the Committee by making it clear that, whereas the new curriculum council for Wales will have enhanced responsibilities and, by inference, a somewhat larger staff, the reverse will be true in England. We anticipate that the new SCAA will have a smaller staff than the total at present employed by the NCC and SEAC. Therefore, it is mathematically impossible for all employees who wish to transfer to avail themselves of the proposal. I was not close to the argument at the time, but it might be that that problem underlay some of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0841">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1331</span>
difficulties that arose from the previous transfer some years ago. This is a different case and cannot be tackled in the way that the amendment suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general employment law applies in these circumstances. The hon. Member for Stretford will know that that law provides that at the point of transfer an employee cannot be in continuing employment with a new body and also redundant. The employee has to belong to one category or the other. What happens subsequently is covered by employment law. My advice is that those who transfer will, on transfer, continue to be employed as civil servants. However, it is always open to a non-departmental public body to propose subsequent changes to employment arrangements, provided that they cover all staff—not only those who have transferred—and that the Secretary of State gives his consent. That would have to reflect changed conditions, but it is important to place that on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Secretary of State, I stand by the letter that he wrote to the two chairmen in July, in which he explained that he was seeking an appropriate balance between continuity of expertise and the opportunity to introduce new blood through open competition. The precise approach to recruitment must be discussed with the new chairman, when he is appointed. That appointment has not yet been made. We hope that it will be made as soon as possible. We expect that the new chairman will take account of the advice of the outgoing chairmen of the NCC and the SEAC when deciding on the appropriate employment structure. I remind the Committee of the slight but important distinction that the members of staff who transfer are not, strictly speaking, civil servants. However, they will transfer on civil service terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out the Secretary of State's general view of recruitment to the new body. We do not intend to present the chairman of the new body with a fait accompli by specifying how he—or she—will recruit staff. One reason for appointing the chairman as soon as possible is to discuss the best staffing structure and the appropriate terms and conditions of employment. Detailed job descriptions would have to be prepared and decisions taken about how to fill each post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the Committee a more detailed description of the precise implications for staff at the NCC and SEAC. However, I stress that existing staff will have every opportunity to apply for posts with the new body, whatever recruitment approach is chosen. Staff recruitment will be subject to the new chairman and the structure that he determines, and to the rights of existing employees to apply for posts if they are not transferred to the new body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was not satisfactory. He has not reassured those who have spent part of their careers serving on the two existing organisations. It is specious to argue that combining two bodies to create one does not represent a transfer. Double-glazing salesmen use such tricks to sell shoddy goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consider, for example, a local authority which wants to privatise part of its services. If it intends to split its refuse collection into two—whatever the merits of such a plan—it would be disreputable for it to argue that that would represent a fundamentally different organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1332</span>
I listened to what the hon. Gentleman said about the appointment of the new chairman and the consultation procedure. It is now more than half a year since the Secretary of State wrote his letter, and more than three months since he promised to have detailed discussions with the existing two chairmen. It is surprising that he has not approached the matter with more urgency, given his absence from our proceedings in Committee. He obviously has had little with which to occupy himself. If the Minister is saying that we shall have time to discuss the matter again when the new chairman is in post, it would be prudent for us, not as a sign of our satisfaction with his response, to reserve our position until later in the Bill's proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing that I wish to do is to mislead the hon. Gentleman. I cannot give a specific commitment when we shall introduce proposals. We are anxious for a chairman to be in post as soon as possible and, on appointment, he or she will have to consider such matters as a priority. I can give that assurance, and it may well be that the hon. Gentleman can return to the issue when the Bill is debated on Report. I do not wish to mislead him by implying a precise timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been open on that. We must reserve our right to return to the matter on Report, hopefully with a new chairman in post and with more information on how the transfer of staff will take place.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to discuss business that is relevant to Wales, even at this late hour. All three Opposition parties are anxious to discuss the provisions of clause 222. We have spent the past few hours discussing the establishment of the new curriculum body for England. The amendments pertain to the new Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales, and there is an important link between the two bodies. We hope that the Minister of State, Welsh Office and the Government will sever that link.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State claimed that the relationship between the English and Welsh authorities has been good. However, the Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales should not be linked with its English counterpart but stand on its own—as do the curriculum and assessment bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, key stages 1, 2 and 3 of the national curriculum for schools in Wales will be vested in the new authority, which will also be responsible for advice on assessment and examinations through the medium of Welsh at GCSE and A-level. However, advice on assessment and examinations for all national curriculum subjects at GCSE and A-level other than Welsh, or subjects studied through the medium of Welsh, will remain the responsibility of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority in England. That is fundamentally wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh body, like its Scottish and Northern Irish counterparts, should be responsible for all curriculum and assessment matters in Wales. It is illogical not to devolve responsibility for advice on GCSE and A-level examinations across the spectrum to the new Welsh body. For two bodies—one of which is outside the Principality—to deal with those matters in Wales, is a recipe for disaster and confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, as key stage 4 develops, a body outside Wales could be responsible for examinations, while the Welsh Joint Education Committee dealt with GCSE examinations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend pre-empts my conclusion. The long-established and statutory body, the Welsh Joint Education Committee, is ideal for dealing with curriculum and assessment in Wales. It is crazy, nonsensical and spiteful not to use that existing body, but we shall have that argument later. There is much unanimity among politicians, educationists and many others in Wales that the functions of the English body should be devolved totally to its Welsh counterpart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support strongly the remarks of the hon. Member for Torfaen. There is clear recognition in the Committee, and elsewhere, of the distinct educational
	<span class='label label-info column'>1334</span>
tradition in Wales, which is evident in many ways. I cite the existence of Welsh institutions such as the WJEC, which is more of an examining board in Wales—like the regional boards in England—and which superseded the central Welsh board in the late 1940s. The fact that education and training come within the remit of the Secretary of State for Wales is further evidence of such recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the national curriculum is significantly, though insufficiently, different, and there is a Curriculum Council for Wales—Cwricwlwm Cymreig. However, the Government are curiously hesitant about accepting that and acting unambiguously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schools funding council for Wales will be independent of the corresponding body in England. It will be established only through instruments at the appropriate time, whereas the English body will be immediately and directly brought into being by the Bill. Wales will not have an autonomous special educational needs tribunal, and the Minister has not defended adequately the failure to establish such a body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the clause is interesting. It is clear that the authority has the capacity to become autonomous. Subsection (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order transfer any function of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority in relation to Wales"</p></blockquote>
to the Curriculum Council for Wales. It seems that the Government have in mind autonomy for that body, but it would be useful for the thoughts of the Minister and of the Secretary of State to be made public. Even better, we want the job to be done properly and an unambiguous, autonomous curriculum assessment authority for Wales be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have nothing to fear about controlling the curriculum, which has been legislated for and whose guidelines Wales must follow. I wish that that were not so, but that is the fact of the matter. There is no danger that the Government's beloved national curriculum might suffer harm by the establishment of a Welsh body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The division of labour between English and Welsh authorities has been mentioned already. That division is understandable, but unsatisfactory. The White Paper gave the responsibility for advising the Secretary of State on key stages 1, 2 and 3—up to 14 years of age—for the whole curriculum to the Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales. Responsibility for advising on assessment and exams in Welsh and on subjects taught and examined through the medium of Welsh for key stage 4 and upwards, including GCSE and A-level, remains with the body in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Responsibility for other subjects, and for the same subjects taught through the medium of English, is with the English body—despite the fact that for the subjects of history, geography, art and music, there are separate statutory instruments for national curriculum considerations in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made also to the difference between the proposals for Wales and the existing provision in Northern Ireland and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Splitting responsibility is peculiar. The distinctive Welsh approach has been recognised, but it is anomalous that the Government have not given the responsibility to the Welsh body for giving advice on curriculum assessment matters across the full spectrum of GCSE and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0843">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1335</span>
A-level examinations. On a practical level, the split will create a difficulty. It will mean that the WJEC, the examining body in Wales, will have to deal with two separate bodies. Among other things, the submission of syllabuses for approval will have to be made to the different bodies. Sometimes discussion between officers will require the presence of representatives from the two bodies and representatives from both will be required to attend meetings on setting papers and awarding grades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be more efficient in terms of time and money for the WJEC to deal with the body located in Cardiff. Obviously, to attend a meeting by crossing the road or travelling a short distance within Cardiff is infinitely more efficient than travelling all the way to London, York or wherever. Certainly for subjects taught through the medium of Welsh, officers from both bodies would have to be present at meetings. Apart from the issue of Welsh distinctiveness and the need for national institutions to give expression to that, a persuasive argument can be made on the ground of logistical efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very least, responsibility for the four subjects—geography, history, art and music—that have a different curriculum content in Wales, which derives from statutory instrument, should be entirely devolved to the Welsh authority. I hope that the Government will go further than that, but at least that far initially. Had we had more time, I would have said a little more about the WJEC and Pwyllgor Datblygu Addysg Gymraeg—PDAG—the development committee for education in the medium of Welsh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Can the Minister suggest one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find "asesu" a perfectly natural Welsh word. I have used it all my life. It is common parlance in Wales and, furthermore, it will be understood by our English colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Labour party is so concerned about the use of Welsh words and the Welsh language, it might have done us the courtesy of having Welsh language speakers among its ranks on the Committee. It has failed to do that. Welsh speakers among Conservative members of the Committee outnumber them by two to one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Be that as it may, the fact is that the new authority will bring closer together work on curriculum development and assessment that reflects the distinct needs of schools in Wales. The authority will assume full responsibility for the development of assessment and examination arrangements for the teaching of Welsh and Welsh as a second language for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1336</span>
pupils during and after compulsory schooling. As we have heard, it will also have full responsibility for national curriculum assessment and testing of pupils in all other subjects in key stages 1 to 3—statutory assessment at the ages of 7, 11 and 14—including the development of Welsh medium test materials in subjects other than English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be extremely important to maintain consistant standards in GCSE A and AS-levels between examining bodies in England and Wales to ensure continuing public confidence in the examination system. That is one reason for my rejection of the suggestion that the Welsh Joint Education Committee be brought in—it is an examining board. The job of the authority is to supervise the examination system. The goals of common accreditation and subject criteria and the quality control of the standards of the independent examining bodies in England and Wales are best served by a single body. The SCAA will carry out that role on a joint England and Wales basis in full consultation with the Welsh authority. Members of the Committee will have noticed the detailed cross-fertilisation between the two authorities provided for in schedule 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to return to the group of the amendments after the Minister has spoken because of the shortness of the debate. If that argument concerning the mixture of examination and assessment is valid, why do bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland do both? The reason for the English body is the regional nature of England. In Scotland and in Northern Ireland, examination and assessment are dealt with by one body. What is the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We certainly believe in maintaining the same standards as English examination bodies. So does the Welsh Joint Education Committee, which happily took part in the review that resulted from the comments of HMI in England on examining boards in England. It is also participating in the new code of practice adopted by all examining boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new body will be a major benefit to Welsh education. It will bring together curriculum review and assessment and create a single, significant Welsh department concerned with Welsh medium education for pupils aged between 5 and 18. The WJEC should not feel threatened by the creation of the new body, which will increase the opportunity for commissioned work and contracts to which we hope that WJEC will respond. Clause 222(1) already provides the power to transfer the SCAA's functions to the new Welsh body, but our intention is to transfer the assessment of Welsh at all key stages, including GCSE and A-level, and the assessment of all other subjects in Wales at key stages 1 to 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise that we gave considerable thought to the transfer of all subjects at key stage 4, but most assessment at that age will be through GCSE. We concluded that assessment should be on an England and Wales basis. It would be wrong to have a GCSE of a certain standard in Wales and a different standard in England—in other words, a separate accreditation in Wales. It would lead not only to ambivalence, but would be a costly exercise. Parental preference, as well as standards, is likely to be common to England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute what the right hon. Gentleman has said, but I disagree that a body which carries out all the functions in Wales will lead to problems
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0844">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1337</span>
of commonality and comparison of standards. The evidence shows that the WJEC is doing as good a job as any examining board in England. This year the HMI found that standards were extremely high and felt that it did not need to be involved, although through its involvement it was able to give the English examining board some good advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall turn the hon. Gentleman's argument on its head. The WJEC was given a clean bill of health by the HMI in Wales, but to ensure consistency for the future the education department in the Welsh Office and the WJEC thought that it should be involved, along with the English examining boards, in the evolution of the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The easiest way to secure consistency is on an England and Wales basis. The early stages—key stages 1 to 3, when the Welsh subject curriculum comes into play—can be handled on a Wales-only basis', although obviously considerable work will be done in England under schedule 12 that will be available to us in Wales. Beyond that point, at key stage 4 when the assessment will be through the GCSE, it is vital that we have a common standard and that we take the necessary steps to secure consistency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the four subjects to which I referred have a separate curriculum content and that that applies to key stage 4? Therefore, is not it reasonable that the Welsh SCAA should be responsible for those subjects as it is for Welsh and the subjects that are taught through the medium of Welsh? Would not it make more sense for it to be responsible for those subjects when they are taught through the medium of English but have a distinct curriculum content for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we have added our own flavour to the curriculum in Wales and have made our own decisions about courses in history and geography, GCSE involves so many core subjects, such as maths, that the desire—which is shared by parents—to ensure that results in that examination are acceptable equally in England and Wales is an all-important consideration. However, I remind the Committee that subsection (1) provides the power to transfer all of the SCAA's functions to the new Welsh body. I have outlined the decisions that we have taken so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used the term "so far". Does he agree that that implies that the transfer of those functions to the Welsh SCAA is not impossible at some future date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have provided for that eventuality in the Bill. However, for the reasons that I have given, we consider that it is vital that key stage 4—at which children in Wales, like those in England, are approaching the GCSE examination and are being measured against each other on an England and Wales basis—should be the same in both England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 892, in page 128, line 42, at end, add
	<br><blockquote><p>'or, to the Welsh Joint Education Committee.'.</p></blockquote>
I want to refer to the role of the Welsh Joint Education Committee, to which the Minister referred when he said that that body was not appropriate to deal with curriculum and assessment matters in Wales. However, many people
	<span class='label label-info column'>1338</span>
in Wales consider that is the appropriate body to deal with those matters. Most importantly, giving the WJEC that responsibility would save the Welsh taxpayer many hundreds of thousands of pounds. It would avoid the necessity of setting up another quango in Wales because the WJEC is a democratically elected body with proven experience and professionalism and a long record of dealing with curriculum and assessment matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary to set up a new body to do work that could be done by WJEC. Frankly, it appears to be an act of spite arising out of the Government's disagreements with LEAs in Wales over the past few years. The WJEC is a ready-made body, set up by statute and empowered by the House of Commons to deal with matters affecting the curriculum in Wales. Moreover, it deals with records of achievement in primary schools, with the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, the National Youth Theatre of Wales and many other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that only six years ago the Secretary of State for Wales asked the WJEC to establish the Welsh language education development committee, known as PDAG. That has had a most distinguished history. It has dealt with micro-electronics units in Welsh and it co-ordinates Welsh language and Welsh medium education throughout Wales. It deals with the printing and publication of Welsh medium books and associated resources. It has the largest pool of staff in Wales dealing with the Welsh language—yet, despite the protests of everyone involved in Welsh medium education, the Government have decided to abolish it. In last week's newspaper, a Welsh Office spokesman said that Ministers have always listened to what those most closely involved in the education system have to say before formulating policy. That is nonsense in respect of that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chairman of PEDAG—Professor Sunderland, principal of University College Bangor—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the Secretary of State should continue to support an independent forum which can guide Welsh-language education in all its aspects".</p></blockquote>
He believes, as everyone in Wales believes, that that body should be the committee. The Principality has the ideal body. It would save money; it would be a popular decision and, most important, it would be the right decision for education in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add a few words to those said by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen about the Welsh Joint Education Committee. Opposition Members believe that it is an appropriate and ready-made body to take on the work of curriculum development and assessment in Wales. In fact, WJEC is the unsung hero of Welsh education. It has worked quietly in the background, never seeking publicity for itself in ensuring standards of constant quality in Welsh education. That was clearly revealed in the HMI report, which said that it was satisfied with the way in which WJEC had continued to maintain high standards at GCSE level in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has already mentioned some of the work undertaken by the Welsh Joint Education Committee, but there are much more. In addition to the GCSE, it looks after A-level and AS-level and the certificate of education. Unfortunately, that examination will be phased out by the Welsh Office, despite the fact that it was seen by head teachers throughout Wales as a most valuable adjunct to the GCSE. It provided non-achievers with a framework of examination by providing short
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0845">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1339</span>
courses that would enable students to make progress over short periods, thereby giving them the encouragement to carry on working.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. gentleman realise that the certificate of education is being phased out at a time when the GCSE is developing? With its 10-point scale, it will be able to deal with those children who would otherwise have taken the certificate of education examination. There is no doubt that 40 per cent. of those who sat the certificate of examination will now reach GCSE level. The remainder will also achieve a place on the 10-point scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely happy that it will be as the Minister says. Were the people who were running the exam and those who were administering it in schools asked whether they thought that it would be a good idea to phase out the exam? Head teachers throughout Wales have been dismayed at the decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will agree that consultation was limited. Does he also agree that when the certificate of education began in 1985 there were 7,000 entries? This year, 25,000 young people are entering it and, next year, 30,000 will be entering it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can add to what my hon. Friend said about the increasing success and popularity of the examination. Many English schools are using it for their low achievers. Last week a friend telephoned me—he is deputy head of a school in Gwent—to say that, in the week in which the Welsh Office announced the demise of the exam, senior staff from a school in Swindon were visiting his school to see how the exam was working because they thought that it would provide a worthwhile alternative for their low achievers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WJEC acts also for the City and Guilds of London Institute and for the Royal Society for the Arts in its vocational qualifications in Wales. My hon. Friend has referred already to the magnificent work that the committee does in Welsh language development and education. It advises the Secretary of State for Wales on section 21 grants. It is the regional advisory council for further education in Wales and it carries out large-scale curriculum development projects. It works with the training, enterprise and education division of the Welsh Office. Training and enterprise councils have also protested about the demise of examination. They felt that it carried out a useful purpose for low achievers and enabled employers to assess abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recommend to the hon. Gentleman that he reads the reply that I have today given to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) about our decision regarding the certificate of education. I must emphasise that we value greatly the work of WJEC. However, although it was set up by order under schedule 1 of the Education Act 1944, it is primarily answerable to local authorities, not to the House. That is the essential difference. The Welsh SCAA will be a statutory organisation responsible to Parliament through the Secretary of State. We value the work that has been done by PDAG, the Welsh language committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intervening in the speech of the hon. Member for Bridgend, so I cannot give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We value the work that has been done under the auspices of WJEC. We are now transferring that valuable, indeed essential, work for the development of Welsh medium education to the new statutory organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The WJEC was set up by order of the House and the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That body is not responsible to Parliament. It is constituted by local education authorities in Wales and responsible to them. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, WJEC has immediate democratic accountability to local authorities. County councillors are members of it. The Minister seems to accept that it already does an immense amount of high-quality work covering almost everything that the Welsh SCAA would be encouraged to do. Its statutory position could be changed to enable the local authority content to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of the broad work of WJEC, it is working with industry and colleges in Wales, Spain, France and Germany on the comparability of qualifications in the motor industry. Could there be a more modern approach to academic and vocational education? It is both coherent and logical that the WJEC should become the Awdurdod Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru. I would still prefer a different word to "asesu".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add a few words in support of what has been said about the relationship between PDAG and WJEC. PDAG is currently a sub-committee of WJEC and has two functions. The first is to provide Welsh medium teaching materials, which it does extremely efficiently. Its second function, which was much more prominent during the campaign for disestablishment, was to provide a strategic development plan for Welsh medium education throughout Wales. If PDAG remained with WJEC, those two functions could be combined. However, the intention is to transfer only one of those functions to the new authority—the provision of Welsh medium materials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister believe that the strategic planning function could be carried out by the Welsh Language Board? Should the strategic planning function for Welsh medium education reside with the Welsh Language Board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly. I have highlighted the fact that the Welsh Joint Education Committee is unique in the British education system. The essential point is that it is responsible to the local authorities in Wales. The full WJEC has 118 members, of whom 84 are county council representatives. They appoint 34 members from the teaching profession. It is a local government body and we shall no doubt discuss its future role when we deal with local government reorganisation after the publication of the Government's White Paper on local government reorganisation in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the work of PDAG, the creation of the new authority provides a wonderful opportunity to strengthen further the status of the Welsh language in schools throughout Wales. We propose to set up a specialist Welsh department within the new authority, which will be charged with ensuring an adequate range of classroom materials for Welsh medium schools, will enable Welsh to be afforded an even higher priority than it has at present and will ensure that the related resources will be deployed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V006P0I0846">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1341</span>
efficiently and effectively. There are various advantages to enclosing within the new authority the work that has been done by PDAG.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Language Bill is progressing through the House of Lords today. When the Welsh Language Board deals with local authorities, it will have a role in ensuring that they have made provision for Welsh speakers living in their communities and that appropriate schooling is available for the children of Welsh speakers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
